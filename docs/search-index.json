    "summary": "This paper introduces MortalMATH, a benchmark evaluating Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to prioritize safety over task completion in critical situations. It reveals that while generalist models appropriately address life-threatening emergencies described alongside algebra requests, specialized reasoning models frequently ignore the danger, maintain high math task completion rates, and introduce dangerous delays. The study suggests that deep reasoning optimization may inadvertently compromise crucial safety instincts in LLMs.",
