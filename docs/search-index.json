    "summary": "This paper presents an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique for neural network-based computational point-of-care (POC) sensors to mitigate misdiagnosis risks from erroneous predictions. Using a paper-based Lyme disease diagnostic platform (xVFA) as a testbed, the Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based approach successfully identified and excluded uncertain predictions, leading to a significant increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7% during blinded testing, all without requiring ground truth information. This enhances the reliability of rapid, accessible diagnostics.",

    "summary": "TICON introduces a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that unifies and enriches embeddings from various tile-level pathology foundation models by integrating crucial slide-level context. This novel approach significantly improves performance across diverse computational pathology tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on both tile-level and slide-level benchmarks, even enabling the creation of powerful slide-level foundation models with substantially less training data.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces H1, an allele-centric pan-graph-matrix, and its dual H2, a path-centric representation, designed to enhance scalability and efficiency in population-scale pangenome analysis. By utilizing adaptive per-allele compression and treating alleles as first-class objects, these representations achieve significant storage compression, especially for structural variants, while retaining full information equivalence to pangenome graphs. This novel approach provides a unified, population-aware foundation critical for advanced genomic applications.",
