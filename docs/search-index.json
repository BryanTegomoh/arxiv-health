    "summary": "This paper addresses the Improving Multi-Armed Bandits (IMAB) problem, relevant to scenarios like clinical trials, where rewards increase monotonically with diminishing returns, and prior algorithms had pessimistic worst-case guarantees. The authors propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms that achieve stronger, data-dependent guarantees by learning near-optimal algorithms from offline data. The first family yields optimal dependence on the number of arms under specific concavity conditions, while the second provides robust performance, guaranteeing best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and gracefully degrading on poorly-behaved ones without requiring explicit assumption verification.",

By incorporating a clinically grounded reward hierarchy and a critical-aware policy optimization, RadFlow addresses inconsistencies in existing flat-sequence models, generating reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate RadFlow's superior performance in improving diagnostic coherence and overall report quality.",
