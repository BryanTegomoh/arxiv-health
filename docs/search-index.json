The model's clinical utility is demonstrated by the Spine Age Gap (SAG), the difference between actual and predicted age, which shows significant associations with common degenerative spine conditions and lifestyle factors. This positions SAG as a potentially valuable biomarker for overall spine health.",

The authors propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a specialist teacher network (fine-tuned on a small, task-relevant dataset) to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large, biased dataset. Their approach, which targets intermediate network layers, consistently outperforms traditional bias mitigation methods and achieves performance comparable to models trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution datasets.",

These models leverage conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees in compact latent spaces, demonstrating an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity data augmentation. AttentionForest achieves superior minority recall, while PCAForest and EmbedForest offer favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.",
