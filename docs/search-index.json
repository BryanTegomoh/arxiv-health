    "summary": "This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to analyze how spontaneous household decisions regarding breeding site control influence mosquito population dynamics. It reveals a feedback loop where perceived risks drive household control actions, which in turn regulate the mosquito carrying capacity. A key finding is that when perceived risk depends on mosquito prevalence, the system can exhibit sustained oscillations in both mosquito abundance and household engagement, arising intrinsically from their dynamic interaction via a Hopf bifurcation.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces FlowLet, a novel conditional generative framework designed to synthesize age-conditioned 3D Brain MRIs. FlowLet leverages flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain to overcome limitations of existing generative methods, such as slow inference and artifacts from latent compression. The research demonstrates that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes efficiently, improving Brain Age Prediction (BAP) model performance for underrepresented age groups and preserving anatomical structures.",

    "summary": "This study developed an interpretable data-driven approach, Constrained Score Optimization (CSO), to recalibrate the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) for improved fall risk prediction. By reweighting JHFRAT items while preserving its structure and clinical thresholds, the CSO model significantly outperformed the original tool, demonstrating improved predictive performance (AUC-ROC 0.91 vs. 0.86). This enhancement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients weekly across the health system and provides a robust, interpretable solution for optimizing inpatient fall prevention protocols.",
