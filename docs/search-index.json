    "summary": "This paper introduces MuISQA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems on complex scientific questions that entail multiple intents and require heterogeneous evidence. To address the limitations of conventional single-intent RAG systems, the authors propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose questions into intent-specific queries. The framework retrieves supporting evidence for each intent, aggregates, and re-ranks it using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), demonstrating superior performance in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage compared to conventional approaches.",

By employing sample splitting, cross-balancing effectively separates errors in feature construction from weight estimation, leading to consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient causal effect estimators. This approach significantly improves both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability, addressing a long-standing challenge in valid outcome-informed causal inference.",
