It leverages a newly curated dataset of 500 million 3D molecular conformers to achieve state-of-the-art performance in key SBDD applications, although the benefits from large-scale pretraining and multi-task training were modest.",

The network integrates anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors with a region-level attention mechanism and a complementary path for full sensor context. It demonstrates superior performance over strong baselines, achieving significantly lower normalized root mean square errors on both an insole dataset and a public walking dataset, proving robust performance for GRF/GRM estimation.",

CER fine-tunes embeddings with contrastive learning and generates token-level attribution rationales, using subjectivity-based hard negative selection to align the embedding space with evidential reasoning. Evaluated on clinical trial reports, CER demonstrates improved retrieval accuracy, mitigates hallucinations, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval crucial for safety-critical domains.",
