Rather than recovering the network structure, the method characterizes how outcomes evolve across observation rounds in response to interventions, using a novel distributional difference-in-differences framework enabled by treatment randomization to compensate for missing network information.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the first statistical framework for robustly comparing epidemic forests, which are collections of plausible transmission trees. The framework utilizes both a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to assess the statistical significance of differences between these forests. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for larger forests (100+ trees), PERMANOVA consistently demonstrated superior sensitivity across all tested epidemic and forest sizes, making it a more reliable tool for distinguishing transmission dynamics.",
