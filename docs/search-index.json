    "summary": "DoFlow introduces a flow-based generative model that integrates causal reasoning into time-series forecasting, enabling accurate observational predictions, interventional forecasting, and counterfactual analysis by leveraging continuous normalizing flows over a causal DAG. Beyond prediction, it provides explicit trajectory likelihoods for principled anomaly detection, demonstrating robust performance on synthetic, hydropower, and real-world cancer treatment time series data.",

Applied to a large asthma cohort, it successfully identified an \"uncontrolled T2-high\" sub-phenotype (38.7% of patients) characterized by elevated eosinophils, allergy markers, and surprisingly high healthcare utilization/medication use. This demonstrates the model's utility for hypothesis generation and cohort identification in heterogeneous diseases lacking clear phenotype definitions.",

It predicted a significant increase in functional independence for patients with full recanalization and early treatment, highlighting recanalization as more beneficial than faster treatment. This work establishes a novel proof-of-concept for ISTs as a tool to evaluate the maximum potential for improvement to patient outcomes, useful in early therapy development.",

Applied to a multi-cohort gait dataset, the framework's attention mechanism critically revealed a severe laterality bias in the data, assigning over 70% attention to the Right Foot for tasks requiring bilateral assessment due to underlying dataset confound, thereby demonstrating its ability to audit dataset integrity. It also proposes novel sensor synergies for future optimized protocols.",
