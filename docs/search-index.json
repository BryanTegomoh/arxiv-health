    "summary": "AuditDM introduces an automated framework that leverages reinforcement learning to train an MLLM as an auditor, generating challenging questions and counterfactual images designed to maximize disagreement among target models. This process effectively discovers significant, interpretable capability gaps and failure modes, which are then used as annotation-free data to rectify the models, leading to substantial performance improvements and enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a groundbreaking application of Federated Learning (FL) to address the diagnostic challenges of rare diseases, specifically collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), where data scarcity and privacy hinder traditional ML approaches. By enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets from two international organizations using the Sherpa.ai platform, the researchers developed an ML model that accurately classifies COL6-RD pathogenic mechanisms from immunofluorescence images. This FL-driven model achieved a superior F1-score of 0.82, significantly outperforming isolated institutional models and demonstrating enhanced diagnostic utility and generalizability.",

The system leverages the discovery that different salts, including lead compounds, distinctively affect radio signal propagation patterns across various frequencies. SoilScanner demonstrated 72% accuracy in classifying soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (with a 200 ppm threshold), crucially avoiding misclassification for any samples exceeding 500 ppm Pb, thereby proving the feasibility of developing portable and affordable Pb detection devices.",
