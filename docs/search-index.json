    "summary": "This paper presents an advanced CNN-Transformer deep learning model for EEG-based emotion recognition, classifying positive, neutral, and negative states with 91% testing accuracy. The model significantly reduces hardware requirements by effectively using only 5 EEG electrodes, enabling accessible and affordable at-home use for continuous emotional monitoring. This innovation holds promise for transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions, particularly in settings where traditional behavioral cues are difficult to interpret.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces cross-balancing, a novel method for causal inference in observational studies that strategically incorporates outcome data into the study design to construct or select balancing features. By employing sample splitting, it effectively separates errors in feature construction from errors in weight estimation, resulting in consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators for treatment effects. The method substantially improves both estimation and inference across scenarios, including high-dimensional variable selection and learned functions, while maintaining interpretability.",
