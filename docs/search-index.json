    "summary": "This paper introduces a unifying theoretical framework, based on 'saddle-to-saddle dynamics,' to explain the widely observed phenomenon of 'simplicity bias' in neural networks, where models trained with gradient descent learn increasingly complex solutions over time. It demonstrates how this dynamic leads to an incremental increase in complexity metrics like rank, kinks, convolutional kernels, or attention heads across diverse architectures, including linear, ReLU, convolutional, and attention networks. The research also elucidates how data distribution and weight initialization influence the learning process, specifically affecting the duration and number of learning plateaus.",

It demonstrates, using a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) model, that the presence of non-rational behaviors and the allowance for behavioral switching significantly amplify the impact of infectious diseases. The research aims to bridge distinct modeling communities and promote behavioral considerations in broader MFG literature.",

    "summary": "This study proposes ScoreMatchingRiesz, a novel method for Riesz representer estimation based on score matching, extending techniques from direct density ratio estimation (DRE) and diffusion models. The primary goal is to address the issue of overfitting commonly encountered with flexible models in Riesz representer estimation, which is crucial for constructing $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in debiased machine learning (DML) for causal inference and structural parameter estimation. The proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also offers new insights into causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.",
