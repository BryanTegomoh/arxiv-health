The study identifies an inherent \"entropy barrier\" to forecasting time series data for various diseases but finds that this barrier often extends beyond the typical duration of single outbreaks. This suggests that outbreaks are generally predictable within their relevant timescales, though the specific forecast horizon varies by disease due to factors like changing transmission dynamics and social network heterogeneity.",
