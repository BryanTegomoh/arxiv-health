    "summary": "This paper addresses the critical issue of label noise in AI benchmarks for clinical risk score calculation, specifically MedCalc-Bench, which is prone to errors from LLM-based generation. It introduces a systematic physician-in-the-loop pipeline with agentic verifiers and automated triage to audit and correct these benchmarks. The study demonstrates that training a Qwen3-8B model on these corrected labels significantly improves accuracy by 8.7% compared to training on the original noisy data, underscoring the necessity of rigorous benchmark maintenance for model alignment in safety-critical domains.",
