    "summary": "LookAroundNet is a transformer-based EEG seizure detector designed to improve detection by incorporating an extended temporal context, mirroring how clinicians interpret surrounding EEG data. Evaluated across diverse datasets, the model demonstrates strong performance, robust generalization to varying recording conditions, and operates with computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment, thereby advancing automated seizure detection towards clinical viability.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework designed for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. By integrating frequency-domain insights and a hierarchical refinement strategy into a SAM-based architecture, WaveRNet effectively addresses challenges such as domain shift from varying illumination and contrast, and the loss of fine vessel structures, achieving state-of-the-art generalization performance.",
