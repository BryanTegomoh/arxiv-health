    "summary": "This paper addresses the critical but underdeveloped field of spatio-temporal reasoning in time series, crucial for high-stakes decision-making in domains like disease propagation, by introducing ST-Bench, a novel benchmark, and STReasoner, an LLM-powered framework. STReasoner effectively integrates time series, graph structures, and text for explicit reasoning, achieving substantial accuracy gains (17-135%) at a fraction of the cost of proprietary models while generalizing robustly to real-world data.",

It demonstrates that large open-weight small language models (20-32B parameters) can achieve validity and accuracy approaching proprietary models like GPT-5.2, especially under guided prompting, though challenges persist for highly complex RADS schemes.",
