    "summary": "UniX is a novel medical foundation model designed for chest X-ray understanding and generation, addressing the inherent conflict between semantic abstraction and pixel-level reconstruction tasks. It achieves this by decoupling the tasks into distinct autoregressive (understanding) and diffusion (generation) branches, synergistically linked by a cross-modal self-attention mechanism. This architecture, combined with rigorous data processing and multi-stage training, significantly improves both understanding and generation performance compared to prior unified models, establishing a scalable paradigm for medical imaging AI.",

By evaluating eight common metrics across three modules focusing on writing style generalizability, synthetic error injection, and expert correlation, the study found that lexical metrics are sensitive to style, GREEN Score best correlates with expert judgments, and BERTScore-F1 is robust to factual errors. The framework aims to address the current reliance on suboptimal metrics by providing a systematic assessment tool.",
