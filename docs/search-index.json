    "summary": "This paper presents an interpretable decision support framework for sepsis treatment in intensive care units (ICUs). The system integrates patient risk stratification, synthetic data augmentation, an offline reinforcement learning agent for treatment recommendations, and a multi-modal large language model (LLM) for generating clinical justifications. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, the approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing robust and interpretable policy recommendations to clinicians.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning strategy for denoising low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images, addressing the challenge of acquiring paired normal-dose CT (NDCT) data. The method employs a progressive, step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism and Gaussian noise regularization to achieve fine-grained denoising. Evaluated on the Mayo LDCT dataset, the proposed technique significantly outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and demonstrates performance comparable to, or better than, several supervised denoising methods.",

    "summary": "MIRACLE is a deep learning architecture designed to predict the risk of postoperative complications in lung cancer surgery by integrating preoperative clinical and radiological data. It employs hyperspherical embedding space fusion for robust feature extraction and incorporates an interventional module for explainable, actionable insights that allow expert adjustment. The model demonstrated superior performance over traditional machine learning models and standalone LLM variants on a real-world lung cancer patient dataset.",
