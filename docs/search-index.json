    "summary": "AdaGReS is a novel framework for token-budgeted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses the issue of redundant context selection by optimizing a set-level objective combining query relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. It employs greedy selection with an adaptively calibrated trade-off parameter, theoretically guaranteeing near-optimal context selection, which translates to improved answer quality and robustness across various domains, including biomedical. This framework significantly enhances the efficiency and reliability of RAG by ensuring high-quality, non-redundant contextual information.",

    "summary": "This study developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data. The computational models successfully captured patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, with derived metrics aligning with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression, demonstrating a promising non-invasive monitoring tool.",
