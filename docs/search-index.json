Using a U-Net segmentation network on synthetic tumors in euthanized mouse lungs, DFI-only input achieved significantly higher sensitivity (83.7%) compared to attenuation-only (51%) while maintaining comparable specificity. The study concludes that DFI substantially enhances early-tumor detectability, offering potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for preclinical or limited-resource screening.",
