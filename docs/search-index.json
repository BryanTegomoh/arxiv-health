Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs revealed a drastic accuracy drop from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy, with leading models also showing significant performance degradation, highlighting a critical generalization weakness. The findings emphasize that current VLMs struggle with uncommon medical presentations, posing substantial risks for their integration into clinical workflows.",

This framework integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial, enabling LLMs to not only affirm valid inferences but also explicitly reject invalid ones, thereby enhancing their robustness and alignment with human reasoning.",
