    "summary": "This paper introduces LIBERTy, a novel causal framework designed to benchmark concept-based explanations of Large Language Models (LLMs) using structural counterfactuals, addressing the limitations of costly and imperfect human-written counterfactuals. LIBERTy constructs datasets by defining Structured Causal Models (SCMs) where concept interventions propagate to LLMs for counterfactual generation. The framework, applied across medical and other high-stakes domains, reveals significant room for improving explanation methods and highlights reduced sensitivity of proprietary LLMs to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation.",

The study details the diagnostic process, which eventually confirmed sCJD through specific CSF biomarkers (14-3-3 and tau proteins), characteristic MRI findings, and EEG abnormalities. It underscores the critical importance of a comprehensive differential diagnosis to distinguish rare neurodegenerative diseases from more common conditions.",
