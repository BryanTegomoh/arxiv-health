    "summary": "MedROV introduces the first real-time open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) model specifically for diverse medical imaging, addressing the limitations of traditional closed-set detectors in identifying novel structures. It achieves this by curating a large-scale multi-modal dataset, employing a pseudo-labeling strategy, and integrating knowledge from foundation models via contrastive learning, resulting in significant performance gains and real-time inference speed. MedROV sets a new benchmark for medical detection by outperforming state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and speed for detecting known and novel pathologies.",
