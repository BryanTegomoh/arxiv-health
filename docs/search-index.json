    "summary": "This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, a critical technology in areas like drug discovery. The attack leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs when triggers are present during inference, all while preserving normal performance on benign inputs. BadGraph demonstrates high efficacy (over 80% attack success rate with 24% poisoning) and stealth, exposing significant security vulnerabilities in these generative AI models.",

It found that pROM repetitions had smaller ROM and shorter durations, especially during the eccentric phase, and identified participant-level variations as the primary driver of differences. The research proposes a novel, consistent metric, \"%ROM\", highlighting the utility of AI for advancing resistance training research and prescription.",
