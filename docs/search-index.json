    "summary": "This paper addresses the dual challenge of deploying accurate deep learning models for plant disease detection on low-cost edge devices and learning from scarce labeled data in remote agricultural areas. It proposes a Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline, integrating Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), to combine neural network pruning with few-shot learning. This approach achieves a 78% model size reduction while retaining 92.3% of the original accuracy, enabling real-time field diagnosis at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel data transformation and explainable machine learning (ML) approach to predict early and complete drug release from 321 long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations. The method accurately predicts early drug release and classifies release profiles, while also identifying key material characteristics that modulate drug release dynamics using Shapley additive explanations, providing a quantitative strategy for LAI optimization. It outperforms current time-dependent approaches for complex release curve predictions.",

By progressively incorporating geometric and structural prior knowledge into different network stages, the proposed method significantly enhances detection accuracy for thyroid and breast nodules. It achieved superior performance compared to 18 existing methods, particularly excelling in detecting morphologically complex nodules on multiple clinical and public datasets.",
