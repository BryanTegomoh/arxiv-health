By aggregating patch-level embeddings to create slide-level features, the research successfully classified WSIs into melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions using various machine learning classifiers. The findings highlight the potential of foundation models to provide a scalable and efficient approach for dermatopathological diagnosis, with Virchow2-extracted features achieving up to 90% accuracy with logistic regression.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a simplified and more robust approach to minimize Nash regret and its generalized form, $p$-mean regret, in stochastic multi-armed bandits, metrics designed to ensure fairness in reward distribution. It demonstrates that a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, preceded by a uniform exploration phase, achieves near-optimal performance under significantly weaker assumptions, offering a broadly applicable solution for fairness-aware decision-making.",

This randomized, single-blind, crossover study used EEG microstate analysis and machine learning to demonstrate that PW tPBM selectively enhances functional network efficiency and duration of microstate C, identifying it as a robust state-dependent biomarker for optimizing tPBM protocols.",

It highlights LSFM's capability for visualizing and analyzing a variety of cancer tissue samples, including patient-derived specimens, organoids, biopsies, and murine models, with specific examples in prostate and breast cancer. The authors propose the integration of advanced LSFM into clinical workflows for high-throughput, three-dimensional imaging of intact cancer specimens to enhance diagnostic precision and provide novel insights into tumor architecture.",

It leverages surrogate models with predictive uncertainty to dynamically shape reward functions, optimizing both molecular quality and multiple property objectives.
