A case study on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilizing European surveillance data, demonstrates that integrating data from other countries consistently improves forecasting performance over models relying solely on national data. This method addresses the common limitation of scarce and less varied single-country historical data, benefiting public health planning.",
