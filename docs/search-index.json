Employing the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework, neuron ablation, and representation analysis on medical QA datasets, the researchers found that role prompts primarily affect surface-level linguistic features. Critically, these prompts did not enhance medical reasoning abilities, create differentiated cognitive pathways, or alter the core decision-making mechanisms of the LLMs, indicating a failure to replicate genuine cognitive complexity.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel switching Dual-Student architecture combined with a Loss-Aware Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The framework enhances knowledge transfer and prevents error reinforcement by dynamically selecting the most reliable student and ensuring the teacher absorbs meaningful information. Evaluated on 3D medical image segmentation datasets, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, achieving higher accuracy under limited supervision.",

Utilizing the MIMIC-III database, the model achieved a high AUROC of 0.822, significantly outperforming a MAP < 65 mmHg baseline, by integrating MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics to provide proactive decision support. This approach marks a shift towards predictive tools that align with actual clinical decision-making for hypotension management.",

The research evaluates three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on social bias (BBQ) and medical (MedQA) datasets, manipulating few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedures. Key findings demonstrate that both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples, prompting design, and instruction-tuning significantly impact explanation faithfulness.",
