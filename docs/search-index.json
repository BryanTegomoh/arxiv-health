    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel text-to-audio jailbreak attack, named \"Now You Hear Me,\" that exploits large audio-language models (ALMs) by embedding disallowed directives within narrative-style audio streams. Leveraging advanced text-to-speech (TTS) models to manipulate acoustic and structural properties, the attack successfully bypasses ALM safety mechanisms with a 98.26% success rate against models like Gemini 2.0 Flash. The findings highlight a critical vulnerability in speech-based AI interfaces and emphasize the urgent need for multimodal safety frameworks that analyze both linguistic and paralinguistic features.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO) to improve medical image segmentation models using inexpensive but noisy automatic quality-control signals, eliminating the need for additional pixel-wise annotations. RN-DPO enhances optimization stability by normalizing preference updates based on the size of the disagreement region between masks, leading to improved and more sustained segmentation performance, especially when judges are unreliable.",

Crucially, it detected previously overlooked PDACs 3-36 months before clinical diagnosis, significantly outperforming board-certified radiologists in sensitivity.",
