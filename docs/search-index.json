    "summary": "This research introduces a novel methodology leveraging frame semantic patterns to identify notifiable events within unstructured open-text fields of electronic medical records. Applied to detect underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in Brazilian primary care, the approach demonstrated robust performance with a precision of 0.726 in identifying violence reports. The methodology is designed to be transparent, efficient, and language-agnostic, making it adaptable for various public health surveillance contexts.",

By integrating a novel hybrid architecture with multi-stream CNNs, a Swin Transformer bottleneck, dynamic cross-modal attention, and a hierarchical gated decoder, coupled with a variance reduction training strategy, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse brain pathologies. The framework demonstrates high generalization and reliability, providing a clinically feasible solution for automated lesion segmentation.",

To counteract this, the authors propose Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), which, alongside a novel Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM) clustering method for inferring proxy demographic labels, incrementally builds fairer training datasets. FGIS successfully reduces inter-group performance disparities by up to 40% with minimal overall accuracy loss, demonstrating impactful fairness gains, especially in low-resource settings.",

By demonstrating that both are based on essentially the same optimization problem via a reparameterization, the study unifies their theoretical guarantees and interchangability. Leveraging this insight, the author proposes a novel regularization method that offers a convex and computationally efficient training procedure for policy learning, circumventing the typically NP-hard combinatorial step of EWM.",
