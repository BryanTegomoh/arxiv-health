    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel pipeline for analyzing spontaneous speech in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, demonstrating that language models (LMs) can identify AD based purely on underlying semantic information, independent of surface-level textual patterns. By transforming speech texts to alter syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantics, the study shows that LM classifiers maintain similar performance, highlighting their ability to detect genuine semantic impairment. This work addresses the limited interpretability of LMs and opens new avenues for early, robust AD detection.",

By leveraging a large, high-quality dataset of chemical reactions and action sequences from patent literature, coupled with a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning (CGR) framework and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), QFANG significantly bridges the gap between computational synthesis planning and practical laboratory execution, thereby enhancing efficiency in chemical research.",
