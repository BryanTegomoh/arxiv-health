    "summary": "UniX introduces a novel unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation that overcomes the conflicting goals of these tasks by decoupling them into an autoregressive and a diffusion branch, respectively. It employs a crucial cross-modal self-attention mechanism to dynamically guide generation with understanding features. This architecture achieves significant improvements: 46.1% in understanding (Micro-F1) and 24.2% in generation (FD-RadDino) with high parameter efficiency, establishing a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image AI.",
