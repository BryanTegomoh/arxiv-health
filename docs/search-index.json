It demonstrates that classic backdoor attacks are ineffective, but BadVSFM successfully injects controllable backdoors by manipulating both the encoder and decoder through a novel two-stage process, leading to missegmentation under specific triggers while bypassing existing defenses. The research reveals an underexplored vulnerability in VSFMs, necessitating urgent development of tailored defense mechanisms.",
