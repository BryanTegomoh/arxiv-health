It addresses the challenges of high computational cost and lack of labeled datasets in conventional inverse dynamics methods by leveraging a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with BiGRU layers and embedding multi-joint dynamics into the loss function. The framework achieves physiologically consistent predictions comparable to supervised methods, but without requiring ground-truth labels, while enabling faster inference.",

The proposed method achieves a high accuracy of 95.25% on the RWF-2000 dataset and significantly improves performance on long videos (83.25% on UCF-Crime), demonstrating strong generalization and real-time applicability for intelligent surveillance.",
