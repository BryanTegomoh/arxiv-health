    "summary": "AdaGReS is a novel framework for token-budgeted Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that addresses the issue of redundant context by optimizing a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. It employs greedy selection with an adaptively calibrated trade-off parameter, theoretically guaranteeing near-optimality for context selection. Experimental results, particularly on a high-redundancy biomedical corpus, demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control, context quality, and end-to-end answer generation.",

    "summary": "This study developed and calibrated patient-specific, multi-scale computational cardiovascular models for four pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data. By coupling 3D fluid-structure interaction models of pulmonary arteries with 0D heart/Windkessel models, the researchers successfully non-invasively captured patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, with model-derived metrics aligning with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. This approach offers a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.",
