    "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of prediction with expert advice under local differential privacy (LDP), proposing two novel algorithms, RW-AdaBatch and RW-Meta, that significantly improve upon classical methods. RW-AdaBatch introduces a novel privacy amplification mechanism, while RW-Meta provides a general method for privately selecting complex, non-trivial learning experts, a significant advancement over prior work. Evaluated on real-world COVID-19 hospital data, RW-Meta demonstrated superior performance, outperforming both classical LDP and state-of-the-art central DP algorithms in predicting high COVID patient density.",
