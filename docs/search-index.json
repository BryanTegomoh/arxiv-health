    "summary": "Multi-context Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA) is a novel theoretical and algorithmic framework that generalizes PCA to systematically identify underlying factors explaining variation across *subsets* of contexts. Applied to gene expression data, MCPCA reveals shared axes of variation among cancer types and uncovers a specific axis whose variability (not mean) in tumor cells is associated with lung cancer progression, insights not achievable by traditional PCA methods. This framework offers a principled way to understand complex biological data across heterogeneous conditions.",
