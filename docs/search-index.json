    "summary": "MedForget is a novel hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning testbed designed to address critical privacy and compliance challenges, such as the \"right to be forgotten,\" in medical AI systems. It models hospital data hierarchically and uses multimodal instances with specific unlearning targets, revealing that current state-of-the-art unlearning methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without compromising diagnostic performance. Furthermore, it demonstrates that fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, while coarse-grained unlearning offers more resistance.",
