    "summary": "This study introduces CBAM-VGG16, an interpretable attention-guided Convolutional Neural Network, for highly accurate plant leaf disease detection. By integrating Convolution Block Attention Module (CBAM) at each convolutional stage, the model achieves enhanced feature extraction, disease localization, and robust generalization across five diverse plant disease datasets, demonstrating superior performance (up to 98.87% accuracy) compared to existing techniques. The approach also emphasizes explainability through various visualization methods, advancing transparent AI in agricultural diagnostics.",

The study reveals a severe performance gap, with state-of-the-art agents consistently ranking in the 0th percentile compared to human experts due to profound domain-knowledge and engineering limitations. ReX-MLE thus exposes critical bottlenecks for developing truly domain-aware autonomous AI systems in medicine.",
