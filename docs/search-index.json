    "summary": "This paper introduces Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that generates multiple specialized subnetworks, or 'adaptive tickets', tailored to specific classes, semantic clusters, or conditions within heterogeneous datasets. RTL consistently outperforms traditional single and multi-model baselines in accuracy and recall, while drastically reducing parameter count, offering a novel approach to align model structure with inherent data diversity.",

The research also highlights the crucial trade-off between model performance and data privacy, advocating for open-weight models in sensitive clinical contexts despite lower completion rates.",

The framework's relevance and comprehensive fourfold interpretability (univariate, global, local, and counterfactual) are demonstrated through experimental validation.",

The method addresses existing challenges in AD diagnosis by enhancing computational efficiency, preserving cross-slice context, and improving feature discriminability, demonstrating favorable performance on multiple large-scale AD benchmarks.",

Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, effectively mitigating modality trade-offs by explicitly structuring representation geometry.",
