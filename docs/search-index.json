    "summary": "LIBERTy is a novel framework that uses explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structural counterfactuals, creating robust benchmarks for evaluating concept-based explanations of LLMs. This addresses the limitations of costly and imperfect human-written counterfactuals, providing new datasets (including for disease detection) and a metric for faithful evaluation. The framework reveals substantial headroom for improving current explanation methods and identifies reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts in proprietary LLMs, likely due to post-training mitigation.",

Experiments show ErrEval significantly improves alignment with human judgments and effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality generated questions.",
