    "summary": "This paper presents a novel application of Federated Learning (FL) to overcome the challenges of data scarcity and privacy in diagnosing rare diseases, specifically Collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD). By enabling collaborative AI model training across two international organizations while keeping patient data localized, the developed FL model significantly improved the accuracy and generalizability of classifying COL6-RD pathogenic mechanisms, outperforming isolated institutional models.",

    "summary": "The paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer control-theoretic architectural framework designed to embed societal values as enforceable constraints and safeguards within AI systems. It models responsible AI as a closed-loop supervisory control problem for socio-technical systems, bridging ethics, control theory, and AI governance to create accountable and adaptive AI.",
