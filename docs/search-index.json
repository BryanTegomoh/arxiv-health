    "summary": "Routing the Lottery (RTL) is an adaptive pruning framework that addresses the limitation of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis by discovering multiple specialized subnetworks, called \"adaptive tickets,\" tailored to heterogeneous data characteristics. This approach consistently outperforms traditional single- and multi-model baselines in accuracy and recall while significantly reducing parameter count and revealing semantically aligned model structures. The work introduces new concepts like subnetwork collapse and a similarity score for diagnosing oversparsification.",
