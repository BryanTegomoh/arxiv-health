    "summary": "This paper presents a novel application of Federated Learning (FL) to address the challenge of data scarcity and privacy in diagnosing rare diseases, specifically Collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD). By enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets from two international organizations using immunofluorescence microscopy images, the study developed an ML model that achieved an F1-score of 0.82 for classifying COL6-RD pathogenic mechanisms, significantly outperforming single-institution models.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer control-theoretic architectural framework designed to embed societal values and ethical principles into AI systems. SRS models AI governance as a closed-loop supervisory control problem, enabling continuous monitoring and enforcement of aspects like fairness, autonomy, and safety throughout the AI lifecycle. It provides actionable engineering mechanisms to translate normative objectives into practical, auditable controls for socio-technical AI systems.",
