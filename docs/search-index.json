    "summary": "This paper introduces the concept of a 'Jordan-segmentable mask,' a topology-aware definition for binary image segmentation evaluation. It proposes a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, digital topology, and homology theory to assess whether a segmentation correctly partitions an image into two topologically separate, connected regions. This addresses limitations of conventional metrics that often fail to capture structural coherence and connectivity crucial for accurate object delineation.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware unlearning method for LLMs that targets internal activation signatures to achieve true knowledge erasure, differentiating it from mere behavioral suppression. KIF successfully breaks the stability-erasure tradeoff seen in prior work, demonstrating near-oracle erasure (FQ ~0.99) while preserving model utility (MU = 0.62) across various LLMs from 3B to 14B parameters. The framework provides the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior.",

This method addresses the challenge of unit and time fixed effects, which typically induce spurious heterogeneity in standard causal forest estimates, by performing node-level residualization during tree construction. Through simulation studies, the package demonstrates validated performance, offering a robust tool for causal inference in longitudinal settings relevant to precision medicine and health research.",
