    "summary": "This paper details the development and pilot evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) simulator for high dose rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy, featuring modules for patient preparation and template-guided needle insertion. The study demonstrated that immediate participation in the VR simulation significantly increased self-reported confidence among oncology staff and trainees across key procedural domains. These findings suggest the simulator's potential for informing future curriculum design in brachytherapy training.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of estimating causal effects in multi-domain settings where a key confounder is unobserved, but a proxy variable for it is available. It proposes a novel methodology to identify and estimate these causal effects in a target domain, even when the causal effect itself changes across domains and only the proxy is observed. The work provides theoretical proofs for identifiability and introduces two consistent estimation techniques with derived confidence intervals, supported by simulations and a real-world application.",
