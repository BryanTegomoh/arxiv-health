    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel SE(3)-equivariant generative model for de novo 3D molecule generation that operates on rigid molecular motifs (fragments) instead of individual atoms. This fragment-based approach achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art atom-based methods, particularly in atom stability on the GEOM-Drugs benchmark, while significantly reducing generation steps and data representation size.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to address the challenges of scarce annotations and significant domain gaps in medical imaging, where data originates from multiple unknown sources. The proposed method integrates a Copy-Paste Mechanism for data diversity and a Clustered Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block for domain-invariant representation learning within a teacher-student framework. It demonstrates robust and precise medical image segmentation performance, outperforming existing semi-supervised and domain adaptation techniques on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks, even with very few labeled examples.",
