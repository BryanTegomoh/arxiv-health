    "summary": "This paper introduces LNU-Net and IBU-Net, two novel deep learning architectures based on the U-Net framework, designed for automated left ventricle (LV) segmentation in cine cardiac MRI. These models integrate specialized normalization strategies and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. The proposed methods experimentally outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice coefficient and average perpendicular distance on a dataset of 805 MRI images from 45 patients.",

    "summary": "This pilot study demonstrates the successful adaptation of transformer-based NLP models across Canadian provincial cancer registries, specifically for classifying pathology reports into cancer/non-cancer and reportable/non-reportable categories. It shows that models pretrained in one jurisdiction can be effectively localized to another with modest fine-tuning, and a novel ensemble approach significantly reduces missed cancers, paving the way for a privacy-preserving, interoperable NLP infrastructure for pan-Canadian cancer surveillance.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an extended SIRS model that distinguishes between original and mutant strain infections and includes a vaccinated compartment. It integrates evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions influenced by social interactions and the epidemiological situation, coupling these dynamics via the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). The framework effectively mitigates outbreaks and highlights vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived side effect risk as critical factors influencing vaccination uptake, providing theoretical support for public health policy design.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the critical issue of performance degradation in pathology Vision-Language Models (VLMs) after deployment, which often occurs due to data distribution shifts and is challenging to detect without labeled data. The authors propose a novel framework that combines input-level data shift detection using a developed toolbox (DomainSAT) with a label-free, confidence-based output indicator. Their findings demonstrate that this combined approach provides a more reliable and interpretable method for identifying actual performance degradation in VLMs, enhancing clinical reliability.",
