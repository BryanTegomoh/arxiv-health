    "summary": "This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models used for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to subtly poison training data, embedding hidden vulnerabilities that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when these triggers are present, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. The study demonstrates the attack's high effectiveness and stealth across multiple datasets, revealing significant security vulnerabilities in these models with critical implications for applications like drug discovery.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic method to improve predictive confidence and accuracy in medical image classification by adjusting soft labels based on the model's own prediction patterns during training. OLS consistently enhances Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy, fosters better feature representation, and improves calibration across various architectures on the RadImageNet dataset, making AI systems more trustworthy in healthcare.",

RELATE utilizes shared modality-specific encoders for diverse attributes (categorical, numerical, textual, temporal) and a Perceiver-style cross-attention module to generate fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representations. It achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while drastically reducing parameter counts by up to 5x, enabling multi-dataset pretraining and paving the way for foundation models for relational graph data.",
