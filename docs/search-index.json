This addresses the current clinical translation barrier of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) due to its high cost and time. The model achieves high accuracy and effectively captures the pulsatile nature of hemodynamics, further enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy using low-cost steady-state CFD data.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the concept of \"hyperdisorder\" to describe a distinct architectural regime in tumor growth, characterized by spatially nonstationary, multiscale disorder that persists or amplifies with increasing observation scale. Analyzing H&E whole-slide images of gastric cancer, the study demonstrates that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual tumors, suggesting growth-driven multiscale incoherence.",
