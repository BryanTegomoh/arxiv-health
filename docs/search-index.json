By applying Sensitivity Analysis to this multiscale model, the researchers quantify the impact of immunological parameters on key epidemiological quantities like the basic reproduction number (R0) and host infectiousness, using Rift Valley Fever Disease as a case study. The findings demonstrate that small increases in within-host pathogen growth can lead to significant increases in population-scale disease prevalence, emphasizing the importance of within-host control strategies.",

The study emphasizes the critical roles of precautious human behavior and effective testing in preventing outbreaks and achieving eradication.",

A significant finding is the derivation of a threshold air velocity that can impair disease transmission even when the basic reproduction number R0 is high.",
