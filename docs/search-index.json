    "summary": "AdaGReS introduces a novel redundancy-aware framework for token-budgeted Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) that optimizes context selection by balancing query-chunk relevance with intra-set redundancy penalties. It employs greedy selection with an adaptively calibrated trade-off parameter, providing theoretical guarantees and significantly improving context quality, answer accuracy, and robustness, particularly for high-redundancy biomedical information.",

    "summary": "This study developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific computational cardiovascular models for four pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data. The models successfully captured patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over two years, with derived metrics aligning well with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. This work demonstrates the potential of computational modeling as a non-invasive tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.",

McCoy leverages LLMs to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and uses an ASP solver to produce robust and interpretable disease diagnoses. Preliminary results indicate strong performance on small-scale diagnostic tasks, demonstrating the potential for explainable AI in medicine.",

It assesses skills by quantifying how well a clinical task is performed on acquired ultrasound images, utilizing jointly optimized clinical task and skill predictor networks without relying on manually predefined skill ratings. Validation on real-world fetal head scan videos demonstrates the framework's feasibility in predicting and indicating ultrasound skills through optimized task performance.",
