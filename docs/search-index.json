CFKD-AFN addresses the scarcity of high-fidelity trial data by leveraging abundant low-fidelity simulation data through a dual-channel knowledge distillation and attention-guided fusion approach. The method demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness, exemplified in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment outcomes.",

    "summary": "This paper surveys the emerging field of \"dataless training\" for neural networks, focusing on their application to optimization problems without requiring traditional training datasets. It examines how various NN architectures (MLP, CNN, GNN, QNN) re-parameterize problems, driven by the limitations of data-driven methods and inherent data scarcity in critical applications like medical image reconstruction. The paper defines and categorizes dataless settings, clarifying their distinctions from related machine learning paradigms.",
