It highlights how CK2 dysregulation in flies not only disrupts circadian rhythms but also models broader pathological processes relevant to human health, including cancer, metabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders.",

The approach effectively addresses challenges like high sequencing noise and lack of labeled data by learning discrete genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 data, the framework achieves high token-level accuracy and significantly improves variant discrimination through contrastive fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for public health genomic surveillance.",

Leveraging this insight, the authors propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), a method that stabilizes unrolled networks by deriving parameters from ODE discretization and aligning intermediate reconstructions with an ideal ODE trajectory. FLAT achieves high-quality MRI reconstructions with significantly fewer iterations and greater stability compared to existing deep learning approaches.",
