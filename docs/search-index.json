    "summary": "This paper introduces a unified theory for causal inference, specifically focusing on Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation, by integrating various statistical methodologies such as Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and matching estimators. It highlights the critical role of balancing weights (also known as Riesz representers or clever covariates) and establishes key equivalences and dual relationships among these diverse techniques, providing a cohesive framework for causal inference.",

This integration demonstrably improves model accuracy, enhances explainability, and facilitates the discovery of new, otherwise costly, causal relationships in real-world biological networks.",
