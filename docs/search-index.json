    "summary": "This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models used for text-guided graph generation. By poisoning training data with textual triggers, BadGraph covertly implants vulnerabilities that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers are present, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. The research demonstrates high attack success rates with low poisoning rates, highlighting significant security risks for applications like drug discovery.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for accurately predicting atomic B-factors, which characterize the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes. Integrating multiscale analysis, algebraic topology, and sheaf theory, PSL significantly outperforms traditional and existing multiscale models in capturing complex biomolecular interactions. The method achieved up to a 21% improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction, highlighting its robustness and potential for broader applications in structural biology and drug design.",
