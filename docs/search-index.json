    "summary": "This paper presents a novel computer vision-based pipeline designed to automatically capture and digitize physiological data from standalone bedside monitor screens, specifically targeting low-resource healthcare settings lacking network connectivity. By employing a hierarchical framework with YOLOv11 for object detection, PaddleOCR for text extraction, and geometric rectification, the system reliably transforms unstructured screen information into structured digital data. It achieved an end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeding 98.9% for core vital signs, offering a practical solution to integrate legacy monitor data into EHR systems.",

By integrating multiple specialized foundation models with a lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) strategy and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism, EnECG significantly reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining strong predictive performance. This approach enhances feature extraction and predictive capabilities across various ECG tasks, making it practical for real-world clinical applications.",
