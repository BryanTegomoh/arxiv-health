    "summary": "This paper introduces a deep learning framework that utilizes fine-tuned ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model, to predict the pIC50 values of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) directly from SMILES strings. Leveraging a large, imbalanced dataset and advanced pre-training strategies, the developed model significantly outperforms classical baselines and demonstrates competitive performance with Random Forest for identifying potential TDP1 inhibitors. This robust, 3D-structure-free tool aims to accelerate early drug discovery for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.",
