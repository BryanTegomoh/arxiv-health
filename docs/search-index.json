It reviews existing strategies by variant frequency class and proposes innovative methodological advancements\u2014including variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference\u2014to extend discovery into this understudied range across diverse disease areas.

    "summary": "This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. It achieves near-perfect classification (>98% AUPRC) across 28 popular LLMs, even identifying sensitive topics with 100% precision. The attack highlights a significant, industry-wide metadata leakage vulnerability, posing risks for users under network surveillance, with evaluated mitigation strategies proving incomplete.",

It identifies that despite individual neurons being nonchaotic, the coupled system exhibits multistability with two qualitatively different attractors, predominantly chaotic, separated by a fractal basin boundary. This fractal boundary leads to extreme final state sensitivity, having significant implications for understanding neuronal synchronization, human behavior, and neurological disease.",
