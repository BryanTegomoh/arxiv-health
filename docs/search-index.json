    "summary": "This study performed the first comprehensive benchmarking of CNN, Vision Transformer, and State-Space Mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs using the DC1000 dataset. Contrary to the growing trend towards complex attention-based models, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net significantly outperformed all Transformer and Mamba variants, achieving the highest segmentation metrics. These findings underscore that architecture-task alignment and domain-specific considerations are more critical than model complexity for effective medical image segmentation, particularly with limited data.",

SparseST pioneers in exploiting inherent data and feature sparsity to achieve computational efficiency while preserving model performance, a strategy largely overlooked in previous efficient AI research. The framework also features a multi-objective composite loss function to approximate the Pareto front, offering practitioners a guide to balance performance and efficiency based on specific deployment constraints.",
