    "summary": "This paper introduces the Early Warning Index (EWI), a multimodal machine learning framework designed to predict patient deterioration in hospitals, encompassing risks of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Leveraging heterogeneous structured and unstructured EHR data, EWI integrates a human-in-the-loop process with explainable AI (SHAP) to provide interpretable risk assessments. Deployed as a hospital dashboard, it achieved a C-statistic of 0.796 and is currently used as a triage tool to proactively manage at-risk patients.",

    "summary": "This paper challenges the conventional reliance on smooth activation functions in reservoir computing by systematically investigating non-smooth variants, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal functions, in echo state networks. It demonstrates that several non-smooth functions, notably the fractal Cantor function, not only maintain stability but significantly outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance, indicating potential for more robust AI models in critical applications like pharmaceutical modeling.",

It advocates for a paradigm shift towards human-centered, temporally coherent, and actionable counterfactuals that align with clinical reasoning. The authors support their position by demonstrating that existing state-of-the-art methods are highly sensitive to stochastic noise, severely limiting their reliability and practical utility in real-world clinical environments.",

In a pilot study, clinicians using these predictions to guide rehabilitation achieved significantly larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores compared to control clinicians.",
