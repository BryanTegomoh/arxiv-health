    "summary": "This paper provides a systematic survey of the computational evolution of spatial omics (SO) from a histopathology-centered perspective, organizing existing methods into three paradigms: integration, mapping, and foundation models. It analyzes how the role of H&E images, crucial for morphological assessment, evolves across these paradigms from spatial context to predictive backbone in response to practical constraints. The review further outlines actionable modeling directions and persistent challenges in the field, serving as a roadmap for developing SO computational frameworks.",

    "summary": "This paper advocates for a more comprehensive approach to managing primary hypothyroidism by utilizing both Thyrotropin (TSH) and free Thyroxine (FT4) values, instead of TSH alone. It introduces Hypothalamus-Pituitary (HP) curves, generated via two novel non-linear programming solver methods, as a tool to determine patient-specific optimal thyroid hormone set points. These methods aim to enable physicians to develop personalized thyroid replacement strategies, with their efficacy tested against existing methods using literature and patient datasets.",

By using a covariance-driven splitting criterion instead of empirical risk minimization, CovRT achieves more balanced and stable splits and identifies covariates with true signals more effectively. The method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both theoretical proofs and empirical validations, enhancing model robustness and interpretability.",

Experiments show Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and other on-policy baselines across various reasoning and generation tasks.",

By optimally integrating LASAN with ECG foundation models via fine-tuning, the framework achieved state-of-the-art diagnostic performance (macro-AUROC 0.990) and demonstrated clinically plausible lead dependence, supporting its potential for automated ECG screening.
