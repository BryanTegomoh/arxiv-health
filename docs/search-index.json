    "summary": "This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to investigate how spontaneous household decision-making regarding breeding site control influences mosquito population dynamics. It reveals that the feedback loop between perceived risks, household control actions, and mosquito abundance can lead to sustained oscillations in mosquito populations, independent of environmental factors. The study characterizes conditions under which these human-behaviorally driven oscillations emerge.",

    "summary": "FlowLet addresses the scarcity and demographic imbalance of 3D brain MRI datasets crucial for Brain Age Prediction (BAP) by proposing a novel conditional generative framework. It synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs efficiently using flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, thereby avoiding latent compression artifacts and reducing computational demands. This approach generates high-fidelity volumes, significantly improving BAP performance for underrepresented age groups while preserving anatomical accuracy.",
