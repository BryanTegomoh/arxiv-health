    "summary": "This study presents a Data-Driven Sparse Sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with the EPA-SWMM model, to optimize sensor placement and accurately reconstruct peak flowrates in urban stormwater systems using minimal resources. Applied to a real-world catchment, the framework demonstrated that only three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes could achieve high-accuracy flowrate reconstruction (NSE 0.92-0.95) and good robustness to measurement uncertainty, addressing a critical challenge in flood monitoring under practical constraints.",
