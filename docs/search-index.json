    "summary": "This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models, enabling adaptation to new target distributions without computationally expensive fine-tuning of large pretrained denoisers. GTL employs a guidance formulation applicable to both discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion, which, combined with an efficient sampler, makes guided language modeling practical for large vocabularies and long sequences by concentrating evaluations on key positions and tokens.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of romanized text input on Large Language Model (LLM) performance in maternal and newborn healthcare triage for Indian languages. It reveals a consistent and significant degradation in LLM accuracy (5-12 points F1 score) when processing romanized messages compared to native scripts, leading to a projected 2 million excess errors at a partner organization. The study highlights that this performance gap stems from the brittleness of LLM classification outputs to orthographic noise, even when the models correctly infer the semantic intent of the romanized queries.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an end-to-end pipeline and a novel diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) derived features. The objective is to overcome the computational expense and time constraints of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, enabling rapid, non-invasive hemodynamic assessment for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) diagnosis. Evaluated on simulated data, the model achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating a scalable and accessible framework for generating crucial diagnostic markers.",
