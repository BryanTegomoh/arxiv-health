It formalizes this failure using $\u0394_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain from multivariate models over univariate baselines, which is typically near zero in the literature.

It establishes an isomorphism between topological phase transitions in Random Geometric Graphs and high-dimensional data manifolds, introducing a 'Percolation Shift metric' that effectively identifies structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse where statistical metrics fail. By translating this topological insight into a differentiable loss function, the approach prevents manifold shrinkage and drives models towards 'Hyper-Generalization,' achieving high fidelity and verified topological expansion.",
