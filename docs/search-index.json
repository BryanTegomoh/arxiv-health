    "summary": "This paper introduces the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), a novel unified network representation that integrates fine-scale gyral and sulcal folding patterns of the brain, addressing the limitations of traditional regional-level network studies. Evaluated across over 1,600 brains of diverse ages and health conditions, GS-Net effectively represents cortical folding from a network perspective and offers a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks in health and disease.",

R^4 decomposes the medical imaging workflow into four coordinated agents\u2014Router, Retriever, Reflector, and Repairer\u2014that iteratively refine free-text reports and bounding box detections. Evaluated on chest X-ray analysis, the framework significantly boosts performance in report generation and weakly supervised detection without requiring gradient-based fine-tuning, making VLMs more reliable for clinical interpretation.",

It reveals that while top MLLMs can rival junior endoscopists in diagnostic reasoning, they suffer from critical 'spatial grounding bottlenecks' and a 'fluency-accuracy paradox' due to hallucination in report generation. The study highlights significant strengths in reasoning but profound weaknesses in visual localization and factual reporting, indicating a knowledge-experience dissociation.",
