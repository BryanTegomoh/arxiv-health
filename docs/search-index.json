    "summary": "This paper introduces a critical framework for designing robust Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks by proactively identifying and mitigating non-visual biases that allow models to achieve high scores without genuine visual understanding. The authors propose a diagnostic principle where benchmark designers should actively try to \"game\" their own benchmarks using a \"Test-set Stress-Test\" (TsT) methodology and then debias them with \"Iterative Bias Pruning\" (IBP). Applying this framework, they uncover pervasive non-visual biases in several prominent MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating how their debiasing process leads to more reliable evaluations.",

    "summary": "This study utilized periodic ordinary differential equation models to investigate how different bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms (plasmid-induced vs. mutation-induced) impact treatment outcomes and the efficacy of various dosing strategies. It found that fixed-dosing antibiotic treatments are more effective against plasmid-mediated resistance, while mutation-driven mechanisms promote the selection of fully resistant strains upon treatment failure. The research also demonstrated that twice-daily regimens surpass once-daily for infection clearance and that a \"catch-up\" strategy is superior for missed doses of short half-life antibiotics.",

This attack achieves near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) across 28 popular LLMs, even identifying specific sensitive content with 100% precision for certain topics. The findings highlight a significant industry-wide vulnerability that poses severe privacy risks for users in sensitive domains like healthcare, despite TLS encryption.",
