It establishes a novel benchmark using Australian TGA consumer medicine information documents and temporally stratified PubMed abstracts to evaluate five LLMs. The study finds that contradictions between highly similar abstracts significantly reduce LLM consistency and factual accuracy, underscoring the necessity for advanced contradiction-aware filtering strategies in high-stakes domains.",
