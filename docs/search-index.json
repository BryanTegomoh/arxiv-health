Applied to a paper-based xVFA platform for rapid Lyme disease diagnosis, this method significantly improved diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7% by identifying and excluding erroneous, high-uncertainty predictions without requiring ground truth data during operation.",

H1 employs adaptive per-allele compression to encode exact haplotype membership, achieving near-optimal storage across all variant types, particularly for structural variations. A path-centric dual, H2, is also presented, maintaining full information equivalence while enabling explicit haplotype ordering for downstream applications.",
