    "summary": "This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models, enabling adaptation to new domains without computationally expensive fine-tuning of large pretrained denoisers. GTL allows sampling from a target distribution via a ratio-based guidance mechanism, leaving the original denoiser untouched. Furthermore, an efficient guided sampler is presented to overcome the high computational cost of GTL, making it practical for large vocabularies and long sequences in applications like language modeling.",

It uncovers a consistent and significant degradation (5-12 F1 points) in LLM performance for romanized messages compared to native scripts, using a real-world dataset. Crucially, this performance gap is attributed not to a failure in clinical reasoning or semantic understanding, but to brittle classification outputs despite the LLMs inferring the correct intent.",

It proposes a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) and a Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module, optimized with a hybrid loss, to improve segmentation performance under limited labeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 dataset demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, confirming the modules' effectiveness in enhancing robustness.",
