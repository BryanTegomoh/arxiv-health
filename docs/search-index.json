    "summary": "This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models used for text-guided graph generation. By poisoning training data with textual triggers, BadGraph covertly implants vulnerabilities that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers are present, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. The research demonstrates high attack success rates with low poisoning rates, highlighting significant security risks for applications like drug discovery.",

    "summary": "This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to precisely quantify movement kinematics in resistance training, analyzing range-of-motion (ROM) variations in lengthened partial (pROM) versus full ROM (fROM) exercises. It found that pROM involved smaller ROM and shorter durations, particularly during the eccentric phase, with participant-level differences being the primary source of variability. The research introduces a novel, consistent metric, %ROM, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance research and personalize resistance training prescription.",

By utilizing shared modality-specific encoders and a Perceiver-style cross-attention mechanism, RELATE generates fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representations, enabling plug-and-play integration with any general-purpose Graph Neural Network (GNN). Evaluations on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that RELATE achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while significantly reducing parameter counts by up to 5x, facilitating multi-dataset pretraining and the development of foundation models for complex relational data.",
