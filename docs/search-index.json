    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of modeling time-evolving biological dynamics in oncology, particularly in scenarios with sparse experimental data where traditional fixed-parameter models are insufficient. It proposes utilizing a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to learn time-varying interactions between cell subpopulations, such as bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their responses to combination anticancer treatments. The approach successfully predicts subpopulation trajectories consistent with biological explanations, offering a novel framework for understanding dynamic biological systems under external interventions.",

    "summary": "This paper argues for a robust safety evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) used in safety-critical roles, particularly when LLMs act as judges (LaJ). It proposes that safety can be enhanced by moving beyond performative claims and instead focusing on evidence derived from a basket of weighted evaluation metrics, context-sensitive error severity, and confidence thresholds for human review. The core aim is to make LLMs safe and reliable for integration into critical information flows previously handled by humans, especially in healthcare.",
