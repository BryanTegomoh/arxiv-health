    "summary": "This paper introduces a trustworthy and frequency-aware segmentation framework for accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in clinical photographs. The framework achieves superior performance (85.05% Dice, significantly reduced boundary error), consistently outperforming strong baselines, and provides interpretable pixel-wise uncertainty maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Its high reliability, marked by zero catastrophic failures, suggests a robust standard for automated vitiligo assessment.",

    "summary": "The Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC) is a novel hybrid neural network architecture addressing spectral bias and dimensionality issues in coordinate-based networks for representing continuous physical fields. It integrates deep learning for diffeomorphic domain warping with classical approximation theory using generalized analytic functions, notably employing a differentiable linear solver for optimal, closed-form spectral coefficient resolution. AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly reduces parameter counts (orders of magnitude), and accelerates convergence (2-3x) on rigorous physics benchmarks, including sparse medical reconstruction.",

It leverages a data-driven methodology based on learned control barrier certificates, enabling quantified safety guarantees for systems in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where traditional formal verification falls short. A key innovation involves a finite Fourier kernel expansion to transform a complex non-convex optimization into a tractable linear program, offering a scalable and distributionally robust framework.",
