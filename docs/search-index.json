    ],
    "summary": "ProfASR-Bench addresses the limitations of current ASR benchmarks for high-stakes professional speech, particularly in medical settings, by introducing a context-conditioned evaluation suite with entity-aware metrics. The study reveals a \"context-utilization gap\" (CUG), demonstrating that state-of-the-art ASR models largely fail to leverage even oracle textual context to improve recognition accuracy. This benchmark provides a critical tool for developing ASR systems that can effectively utilize side information in domains with dense terminology and low error tolerance.",
