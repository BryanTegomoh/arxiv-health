A literature review in materials science revealed a median GIFTERS score of 5/7, indicating a significant lack of comprehensive trustworthiness reporting, with specific omissions in fairness for Bayesian studies and interpretability for non-Bayesian methods, emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop and integrated approaches.",

It identified that n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles excelled at 3-4-week forecasting horizons, particularly nationally and in the Midwest and West, while ARIMA and GAM performed best for shorter 1-2-week forecasts. The research highlights the critical need for region-specific modeling strategies to optimize public health responses during pandemics.",
