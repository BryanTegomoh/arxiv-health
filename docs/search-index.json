By designing a synthetic classification task with a known optimal Bayes estimator, the authors demonstrate that both conventional and newer correlated MIL methods exhibit significant generalization gaps, struggling to leverage essential contextual relationships even with extensive training data.",

The approach, applied to Spinal Muscular Atrophy, successfully quantifies treatment switch effects and demonstrates its utility for addressing challenges in small data settings.",

It presents theoretical findings on population convergence in migration frameworks (without deaths) and numerical results on how cure timing affects mortality rates and how localized interventions impact disease spread across cities. The work offers a more expressive tool for epidemiological research and public health planning by modeling epidemics at a local scope.",
