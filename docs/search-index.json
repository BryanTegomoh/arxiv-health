    "summary": "This paper proposes an evolution-based modeling approach to estimate population-level causal effects in networked systems where interference pathways are largely unobserved. It argues that precisely recovering the network structure is unnecessary; instead, characterizing how outcomes evolve across observation rounds in response to interventions, using low-dimensional recursive equations, suffices. This method offers a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences, leveraging treatment randomization to implicitly sample hidden interference channels and learn about heterogeneous spillover effects.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces the first statistical framework to formally compare epidemic forests, which are collections of plausible transmission trees inferred from outbreak data. Addressing the lack of a robust method to assess differences between such forests, the authors propose using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Their assessment shows PERMANOVA consistently outperforms the chi-square test in sensitivity, while both achieve perfect specificity for larger forests, providing a robust tool for epidemic analysis.",
