    "summary": "This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models, enabling adaptation to new target distributions without fine-tuning large pretrained denoisers. GTL provides a unified framework for both discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion, further enhanced by an efficient sampler that significantly reduces computational cost for practical large-scale language modeling. This approach addresses the challenge of high training costs and data scarcity for specialized domains by making transfer learning more efficient.",

    "summary": "This paper evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in maternal and newborn healthcare triage when processing Indian languages, specifically comparing native scripts to romanized text. It reveals a consistent and significant degradation in LLM performance (5-12 F1 points lower) for romanized inputs, which could lead to millions of excess triage errors in real-world clinical settings. Crucially, the study finds that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries but fail to reliably act on it in final classification due to orthographic noise.",

It then develops a diffusion-based regression model to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA-derived features, bypassing computationally expensive CFD simulations. The model achieved state-of-the-art performance on a simulated dataset, offering a rapid and non-invasive approach for coronary artery disease diagnosis.",

It addresses limitations in existing methods by proposing a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) and a Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module.

The model, a six-hidden-layer neural network, was trained on a large dataset of 8,049 simulated polymer-solvent pairs and achieved strong agreement with actual solubility, demonstrating generalizability on unseen experimental data. This approach enables scalable and high-throughput solvent screening for diverse applications, including green chemistry and materials design.",
