It argues that precisely recovering the network structure is unnecessary; instead, characterizing how outcomes evolve across observation rounds in response to interventions is sufficient, leveraging an exposure-mapping perspective to identify conditions for low-dimensional recursive outcome equations.",

It achieves this by curating a large multi-modal dataset (Omnis), employing pseudo-labeling for data heterogeneity, and leveraging pre-trained foundation models with contrastive learning. The model effectively detects both known and novel medical structures, setting a new benchmark for speed and accuracy.",

    "summary": "This paper identifies and formalizes the 'Driver-Blindness Phenomenon' in deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting, where these models consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers like insulin, meals, and activity. It introduces $\u0394_{\text{drivers}}$, a metric to quantify the performance gain from incorporating drivers, and observes that this gain is typically near zero across the literature. The authors attribute this to architectural biases, data fidelity issues, and physiological heterogeneity, proposing mitigation strategies and recommending routine reporting of $\u0394_{\text{drivers}}$ to ensure models are truly leveraging clinical insights.",
