    ],
    "summary": "This paper introduces a deep learning framework utilizing fine-tuned ChemBERTa models to accurately predict the pIC50 values of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) directly from their SMILES strings. Addressing the challenge of cancer chemoresistance, the approach leverages a large, imbalanced dataset and systematically evaluates pre-training strategies, outperforming classical baselines and demonstrating competitive virtual screening utility. The resulting model offers a robust, 3D-structure-free tool to accelerate the discovery of TDP1 inhibitors.",
