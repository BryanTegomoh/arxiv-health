By pretraining a shared encoder with a masked modeling objective, TICON generates rich, contextualized representations that significantly improve performance across diverse tile and slide-level tasks. This approach enables the creation of highly efficient and accurate slide-level foundation models using substantially less data than previous state-of-the-art methods.",

By treating alleles as first-class objects, H1 achieves near-optimal storage and significant compression gains, particularly for structural variants, as validated with real human genome data. It provides a unified, population-aware foundation that also yields H2, a path-centric dual representation, both exactly equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs.",
