    "summary": "This study employs periodic ordinary differential equation models to investigate how different antibiotic resistance mechanisms (plasmid-induced vs. mutation-induced) impact treatment outcomes and optimal dosing strategies. It reveals that fixed dosing is more effective against plasmid-mediated resistance, while mutation-driven resistance favors the selection of fully resistant strains upon treatment failure. The research also identifies superior dosing regimens, showing twice-daily regimens outperform once-daily for infection clearance, and a \"catch-up\" strategy is best for missed doses of short half-life antibiotics.",

It enables scalable, controllable generation by incorporating a principled conditional latent-variable formulation and efficient LoRA-based finetuning, demonstrating competitive performance on molecular generation benchmarks and effective property-guided design. The model's success suggests that modernized Variational Autoencoders remain a competitive approach for de novo molecular generation when coupled with advanced techniques.",
