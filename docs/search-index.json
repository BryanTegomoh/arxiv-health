    "summary": "This paper introduces Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that moves beyond the traditional Lottery Ticket Hypothesis by discovering multiple specialized subnetworks, or 'adaptive tickets,' tailored to specific data characteristics like classes or semantic clusters. RTL consistently outperforms baselines, significantly reduces model parameters, and identifies 'subnetwork collapse' with a novel diagnostic tool, thereby promoting more modular and context-aware deep learning architectures.",

It highlights the critical need for safeguards to prevent the amplification of biases in human-centred AI systems.",
