By integrating causal inference with multi-layer graph neural networks, particularly through GNN-based propensity scoring, the method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy and identifies more stable and biologically interpretable biomarkers. This robust tool holds strong potential for advancing precision medicine by providing more reliable insights into disease mechanisms.",

    ],
    "summary": "This paper introduces MedRule-KG, a novel system designed to impose domain-consistent structure on large language models (LLMs) for scientific reasoning and early-stage drug discovery. By combining a knowledge-graph scaffold with a lightweight verifier, MedRule-KG steers LLM generation towards mathematically and biomedically valid outputs. The system significantly reduces violation counts by 83.2% while improving exact match across tasks like reaction feasibility, metabolic compatibility, and toxicity screening, making LLM-based drug discovery more reliable and practical.",
