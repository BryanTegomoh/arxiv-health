    "summary": "This paper presents a novel framework for breast cell segmentation that achieves a Dice score of 95.5% using only 599 training images, addressing significant challenges like extreme data scarcity, severe class imbalance, and high prevalence of negative samples. The approach integrates quantum-inspired edge enhancement, a stabilized multi-component loss function, and complexity-based weighted sampling to improve boundary detection and small lesion identification, thereby drastically reducing the expert annotation time required for medical AI development.",

The authors found that improving fairness through bias mitigation techniques significantly alters Shapley-based feature importance rankings, sometimes with differential impacts across different racial subgroups. This highlights the critical need for a holistic assessment of ML models, considering accuracy, fairness, and explainability in conjunction, rather than individually.",

    "summary": "This paper demonstrates the successful cross-domain validation of a self-supervised encoder, initially trained on large mesothelioma resection specimens, for application to small biopsy material. The model effectively captures meaningful morphological patterns from biopsies, enabling accurate prediction of patient survival and classification of tumor subtypes. This innovation broadens the practical utility of AI in mesothelioma diagnostics by overcoming the common limitation of requiring large tissue samples.",

    "summary": "GRASP addresses mode collapse in text-to-image diffusion models for long-tail medical imaging by resolving gradient conflicts between frequent and rare classes. It achieves this by statically partitioning samples into clusters using external priors and then fine-tuning models with cluster-specific residual adapters. The method significantly improves generation quality and diversity for rare medical pathologies, boosting downstream classification performance for underrepresented conditions.",

The proposed method, SRCSM, leverages semantic-aware random convolution during training and intensity mapping at test-time to achieve state-of-the-art performance. SRCSM consistently outperforms previous DG techniques and remarkably matches in-domain baseline performance in several cross-modality and cross-center segmentation tasks.",
