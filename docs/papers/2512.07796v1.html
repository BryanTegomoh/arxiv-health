                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DEMOCRITUS operates through a six-module pipeline. It uses a high-quality LLM to initiate the process by proposing topics and generating causal questions within a specified domain. Subsequently, it extracts plausible causal statements from diverse textual sources via targeted LLM queries. The core technical challenge is then addressed by novel categorical machine learning methods, which convert these initially fragmented, potentially ambiguous, and conflicting textual claims into structured relational causal triples. These triples are then embedded and woven into a coherent Large Causal Model, distinct from traditional experimental numerical data-driven causal inference.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We introduce a new paradigm for building large causal models (LCMs) that exploits the enormous potential latent in today's large language models (LLMs). We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology. We discuss the limitations of the current DEMOCRITUS system, and outline directions for extending its capabilities.</p>
