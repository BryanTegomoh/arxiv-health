                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), a volatility-aware pretraining strategy for Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Unlike uniform masking, CV-Masking adaptively adjusts masking probabilities based on the intrinsic variability of each clinical feature, combined with a value-only masking objective. This novel approach systematically improves feature reconstruction, downstream predictive performance, and model convergence, leading to more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work is crucial for developing more sophisticated and clinically relevant AI models for healthcare by acknowledging and leveraging the inherent biological and pathological variability of patient data. By creating more accurate and robust representations of complex patient states from EHRs, it can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, prognostication, and the management of acute conditions where volatile biomarkers are key.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research improves the foundational AI models (Masked Autoencoders) used to process and understand complex Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. By creating 'volatility-aware' representations of patient laboratory tests, it enables these models to generate more robust and clinically meaningful insights. These enhanced representations can then be applied to various downstream clinical tasks, such as disease prediction, risk stratification, diagnosis support, treatment optimization, and overall patient management based on AI-driven analysis of their health records.</p>

                    <p>The paper proposes Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), a volatility-aware pretraining strategy for Masked Autoencoders (MAEs). This method adaptively adjusts masking probabilities for individual EHR features (e.g., lab tests) based on their intrinsic variability, quantified by the Coefficient of Variation. It is combined with a 'value-only masking objective' to focus reconstruction on actual values. The strategy was empirically evaluated on a large panel of laboratory tests and compared against uniform random and variance-based masking approaches.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Masked autoencoders (MAEs) are increasingly applied to electronic health records (EHR) for learning general-purpose representations that support diverse clinical tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.</p>
