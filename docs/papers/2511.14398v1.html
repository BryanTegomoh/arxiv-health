                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves developing an Ordinal Regression-based framework for classifying stages of Diabetic Retinopathy from fundus images. Input images from the APTOS-2019 dataset undergo a specific preprocessing sequence: Green Channel (GC) Extraction, Noise Masking, and Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Model performance is rigorously evaluated using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) score, a metric designed to assess agreement for ordered categories, with a strong emphasis on aligning results with expert clinical grading.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) has emerged as a major cause of preventable blindness in recent times. With timely screening and intervention, the condition can be prevented from causing irreversible damage. The work introduces a state-of-the-art Ordinal Regression-based DR Detection framework that uses the APTOS-2019 fundus image dataset. A widely accepted combination of preprocessing methods: Green Channel (GC) Extraction, Noise Masking, and CLAHE, was used to isolate the most relevant features for DR classification. Model performance was evaluated using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa, with a focus on agreement between results and clinical grading. Our Ordinal Regression approach attained a QWK score of 0.8992, setting a new benchmark on the APTOS dataset.</p>
