                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This tutorial article introduces Over-the-Air Federated Learning (AirFL) as a paradigm tightly integrating wireless signal processing and distributed machine learning to enable scalable AI at the network edge. AirFL leverages the superposition property of wireless signals for simultaneous communication and model aggregation, thereby significantly reducing latency, bandwidth, and energy consumption. The paper provides a comprehensive guide, classifying AirFL into CSIT-aware, blind, and weighted approaches, and discussing their theoretical foundations, performance, complexity, practical limitations, and future research directions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>AirFL is critical for advancing medical AI by enabling privacy-preserving machine learning on sensitive patient data distributed across hospitals, clinics, or wearable devices. Its efficiency improvements mean AI models can be trained faster and more cost-effectively on large, decentralized medical datasets without raw data ever leaving its secure local environment, addressing major regulatory and ethical concerns in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>AirFL can enhance the practical implementation of privacy-preserving AI and real-time AI at the edge in healthcare. It would enable more efficient and faster training of AI models across decentralized medical datasets (e.g., from multiple hospitals, clinics, or research institutions) without sensitive raw data leaving local premises, crucial for applications like federated learning for diagnostic support, drug discovery, or developing personalized treatment models. Furthermore, its benefits for Edge AI (reduced latency, bandwidth, energy) can improve real-time decision-making on local medical devices, such as wearables for remote patient monitoring or AI-powered sensors in smart hospitals, by making model updates and inferences more responsive and resource-efficient.</p>
