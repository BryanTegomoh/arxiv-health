                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper conducts a detailed mechanistic analysis of autoregressive transformers trained on drug-like small molecules to unravel how these models capture the fundamental rules of molecular representation. It identifies internal computational patterns consistent with both low-level syntactic parsing and more abstract chemical validity constraints, leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract feature dictionaries linked to chemically relevant activation patterns. The research demonstrates that these mechanistic insights significantly enhance predictive performance in various practical settings, advancing the interpretability and utility of AI in chemical design.</p>

                    <p>The primary findings include the discovery of internal computational circuits within molecular transformers that effectively capture both the syntactic rules governing molecular representation (e.g., SMILES string grammar) and higher-level abstract chemical validity principles. Furthermore, the successful application of Sparse Autoencoders allowed for the extraction of interpretable feature dictionaries, demonstrating that these models implicitly learn and encode chemically relevant features, which, when understood, lead to enhanced predictive performance.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Transformers generate valid and diverse chemical structures, but little is known about the mechanisms that enable these models to capture the rules of molecular representation. We present a mechanistic analysis of autoregressive transformers trained on drug-like small molecules to reveal the computational structure underlying their capabilities across multiple levels of abstraction. We identify computational patterns consistent with low-level syntactic parsing and more abstract chemical validity constraints. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we extract feature dictionaries associated with chemically relevant activation patterns. We validate our findings on downstream tasks and find that mechanistic insights can translate to predictive performance in various practical settings.</p>
