                    <p>The authors conducted a mechanistic analysis of autoregressive transformer models, which were specifically trained on datasets comprising drug-like small molecules. This involved probing the internal computational structures to identify how molecular representation rules are captured. A key methodological component was the application of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract 'feature dictionaries' by analyzing activation patterns within the neural network, thereby associating specific neuronal activations with chemically interpretable features. The insights gained were then validated through their application to various downstream molecular design tasks, evaluating the impact on predictive performance.</p>

Crucially, the use of Sparse Autoencoders enabled the extraction of distinct feature dictionaries, where specific activation patterns directly corresponded to chemically relevant features. These mechanistic insights and the derived feature representations were proven to enhance the predictive performance of the models in practical settings, confirming that interpretability can directly lead to improved utility and accuracy.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Transformers generate valid and diverse chemical structures, but little is known about the mechanisms that enable these models to capture the rules of molecular representation. We present a mechanistic analysis of autoregressive transformers trained on drug-like small molecules to reveal the computational structure underlying their capabilities across multiple levels of abstraction. We identify computational patterns consistent with low-level syntactic parsing and more abstract chemical validity constraints. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we extract feature dictionaries associated with chemically relevant activation patterns. We validate our findings on downstream tasks and find that mechanistic insights can translate to predictive performance in various practical settings.</p>
