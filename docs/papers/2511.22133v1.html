                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research introduces a probabilistic digital twin framework designed for predicting responses in dynamical systems with misspecified physics. It integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to perform end-to-end, uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. The framework effectively diagnoses model-form errors as latent forces, learns their probabilistic mapping from system states, and then propagates this uncertainty for robust state prediction, demonstrated by its accuracy across various nonlinear systems and benchmarks.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework offers a robust method for creating 'digital twins' of biological and physiological systems, which are inherently complex, nonlinear, and often governed by incompletely understood (misspecified) physics. By providing uncertainty-aware predictions, it can enhance personalized medicine, disease progression modeling, and medical device monitoring, making predictions more reliable and actionable in clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI framework could be utilized to create sophisticated 'patient digital twins' by integrating real-time physiological sensor data (e.g., from wearables, implanted devices, ICU monitors) with existing, yet imperfect, physiological models. It can identify individual-specific deviations or 'model-form errors' which might represent unique disease progression patterns, individual responses to drugs, or unmeasured biological factors. This enables personalized diagnosis of current health states and robust prognosis of future health trajectories, predicting outcomes or optimal treatment strategies while explicitly quantifying the associated uncertainties. Such capabilities are fundamental for developing trustworthy, explainable, and personalized AI in healthcare, improving predictive maintenance for medical devices, and advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This work presents a probabilistic digital twin framework for response prediction in dynamical systems governed by misspecified physics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.</p>
