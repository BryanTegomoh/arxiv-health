                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a unified framework of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) for modeling the coevolution of infection and information spread, encompassing models like SIR epidemics and Daley-Kendall rumor dynamics. It derives a classification of asymptotic behavior for these models under specific graph-theoretic conditions, conjecturing exponential decay for vanishing states, while noting non-exponential decay when these conditions are violated.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This unified modeling approach provides a robust framework to understand and predict the complex interplay between disease spread and information dynamics (e.g., health messages, misinformation), which is crucial for designing effective public health interventions and communication strategies during outbreaks.</p>

                <p>While the models and theoretical insights derived in this paper could inform the development or parameterization of AI/ML models for epidemic forecasting, public health intervention optimization, or understanding complex spreading dynamics (e.g., infodemiology), the paper itself presents mathematical theoretical results for coupled ODE models, not an AI application or method. Therefore, there is no direct AI health application described within this abstract.</p>

                    <p>The paper presents a comprehensive ODE-based framework for jointly modeling infection and information spread, offering a theoretical classification of the asymptotic behavior (long-term fate) of states within this general model class. It identifies specific graph-theoretic conditions that predict exponential decay for vanishing states, while also demonstrating that the failure to meet these conditions can lead to complex, non-exponential (e.g., algebraic) decay patterns. Fundamental properties like asymptotic stability and $L^1$-integrability for the state variables are proven, and a novel 'dependency graph' is introduced and shown to be useful for visualizing and analyzing model structure and its impact on dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By offering a deeper understanding and more accurate predictive capabilities for the joint spread of diseases and related information, this research can directly inform strategies for disease control, optimize public health communication campaigns, and improve the management of health misinformation during epidemics and pandemics. The ability to predict long-term trends and identify critical intervention points based on model structure has direct practical implications for public health planning.</p>

Further application and development of the novel 'dependency graph' for increasingly intricate interaction structures and heterogeneous populations could also be explored.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Growing literatures on epidemic and rumor dynamics show that infection and
information coevolve. We present a unified framework for modeling the spread of
infection and information: a general class of interaction-driven fluid-limit
models expressed as coupled ODEs. The class includes the SIR epidemic model,
the Daley-Kendall rumor model, and many extensions. For this general class, we
derive theoretical results: under explicit graph-theoretic conditions, we
obtain a classification of asymptotic behavior and motivate a conjecture of
exponential decay for vanishing states. When these conditions are violated, the
classification can fail, and decay may become non-exponential (e.g.,
algebraic). In deriving the main result, we establish asymptotic stability and
$L^1$-integrability properties for state variables. Alongside these results, we
introduce the dependency graph that captures outflow dependencies and offers a
new angle on the structure of this model class. Finally, we illustrate the
results with several examples, including a heterogeneous rumor model and a
rumor-dependent SIR model, showing how small changes to the dependency graph
can flip asymptotic behavior and reshape epidemic trajectories.</p>
