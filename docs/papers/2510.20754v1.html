                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated histopathological image analysis plays a vital role in
computer-aided diagnosis of various diseases. Among developed algorithms, deep
learning-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple
tasks, including semantic tissue segmentation in histological images. In this
study, we propose a novel approach based on attention-driven feature fusion of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) within a
unified dual-encoder model to improve semantic segmentation performance.
Evaluation on two publicly available datasets showed that our model achieved
{\mu}IoU/{\mu}Dice scores of 76.79%/86.87% on the GCPS dataset and
64.93%/76.60% on the PUMA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art and baseline
benchmarks. The implementation of our method is publicly available in a GitHub
repository: https://github.com/NimaTorbati/ACS-SegNet</p>
