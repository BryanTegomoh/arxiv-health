                    <p>HiF-DTA is a hierarchical deep learning network employing a dual-pathway strategy for drug and protein sequence processing, designed to extract both global semantic and local topological features. Concurrently, it models drugs at multiple scales—atomic, substructural, and molecular—to learn comprehensive representations. These multi-scale drug features are then fused using a multi-scale bilinear attention module, which subsequently feeds into the DTA prediction task.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.</p>
