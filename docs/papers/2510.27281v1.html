                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">HiF-DTA is a novel hierarchical deep learning network designed to improve Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) prediction by addressing limitations in existing sequence-based methods. It achieves superior performance by simultaneously extracting global sequence semantic and local topological features from drugs and proteins, and by modeling drugs with multi-scale representations (atomic, substructural, molecular) fused via bilinear attention. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the importance of its global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion components.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.</p>
