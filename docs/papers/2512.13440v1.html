                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>IMILIA is an end-to-end framework composed of two main modules. The inflammation prediction module utilizes a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model trained on H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) of IBD tissues. The interpretability module consists of two components: HistoPLUS, which performs detection, segmentation, and classification of individual cell instances (e.g., immune cells, epithelial cells), and EpiSeg, which segments epithelial regions. These components allow for the automated characterization of specific tissue regions and cell populations that drive the MIL model's inflammation predictions.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>IMILIA demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, achieving ROC-AUC scores of 0.83 on the internal discovery cohort and 0.99 and 0.84 on two distinct external validation cohorts. Crucially, the interpretability module revealed that high predicted inflammation scores consistently correlated with increased densities of various immune cell types, including lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, across all datasets. Conversely, tiles associated with lower inflammation scores were predominantly characterized by normal epithelial cells, confirming the biological consistency and validity of the model's predictions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>IMILIA has the potential to significantly improve the standardization and objectivity of microscopic inflammation assessment in IBD, complementing or assisting pathologists. By providing an automated and interpretable tool, it could facilitate more accurate evaluation of disease activity, guide personalized treatment strategies aimed at achieving histologic remission, and reduce inter-observer variability in pathology reports. This could lead to more timely and effective therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving the quality of care and long-term outcomes for IBD patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.</p>
