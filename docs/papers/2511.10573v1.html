                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework to address the limitations of existing personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support, which often overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. The RRL framework formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), optimizing engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. It achieves this through a multi-objective reward function and an emotion-informed state representation, aiming to provide emotionally intelligent and trustworthy interventions in sensitive domains like mental illness and substance use disorders.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.</p>
