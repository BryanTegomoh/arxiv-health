                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The researchers performed a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real-world baby care and pregnancy-related search queries submitted to Google. They utilized a robust evaluation framework to assess multiple quality dimensions for both AI Overviews (AIO) and Featured Snippets (FS), specifically analyzing answer consistency between the two features, relevance, the explicit presence of medical safeguards, the categories of linked sources, and sentiment alignment.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study revealed significant information inconsistency, with AIO and FS providing conflicting information on the same search result page in 33% of cases. A critical finding was the near-absence of medical safeguards, present in only 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses. While health and wellness websites were primary sources, Featured Snippets frequently sourced information from commercial entities.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Clinically, these findings highlight a significant risk to patients seeking health information online, particularly in vulnerable populations like pregnant individuals and new parents. Healthcare providers must be cognizant of the potential for misinformation from AI-generated search results and proactively educate patients on how to critically evaluate online health advice and prioritize consulting qualified medical professionals. This research supports the urgent need for industry standards and regulatory oversight to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI-mediated health information.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations could include the focus on a specific set of queries (baby care, pregnancy) which may not generalize to all medical domains, and the dynamic nature of Google's algorithms which may evolve over time.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Google Search increasingly surfaces AI-generated content through features like AI Overviews (AIO) and Featured Snippets (FS), which users frequently rely on despite having no control over their presentation. Through a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real baby care and pregnancy-related queries, we evaluate the quality and consistency of these information displays. Our robust evaluation framework assesses multiple quality dimensions, including answer consistency, relevance, presence of medical safeguards, source categories, and sentiment alignment. Our results reveal concerning gaps in information consistency, with information in AIO and FS displayed on the same search result page being inconsistent with each other in 33% of cases. Despite high relevance scores, both features critically lack medical safeguards (present in just 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses). While health and wellness websites dominate source categories for both, AIO and FS, FS also often link to commercial sources. These findings have important implications for public health information access and demonstrate the need for stronger quality controls in AI-mediated health information. Our methodology provides a transferable framework for auditing AI systems across high-stakes domains where information quality directly impacts user well-being.</p>
