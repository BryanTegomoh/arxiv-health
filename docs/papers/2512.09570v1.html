                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper meticulously analyzes how international AI governance frameworks address gender issues and gender-based harms, identifying both emerging trends and critical gaps. It argues for the necessity of intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive AI governance to prevent the reinforcement of existing inequalities and foster meaningful equity in a technologically advanced future.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>AI systems are increasingly used in healthcare, impacting diagnostics, treatment planning, and drug discovery. Biases, particularly gender-based ones, if not addressed by robust governance, can lead to medical errors, misdiagnoses, and inequitable health outcomes for diverse patient populations, exacerbating existing health disparities.</p>
            </section>

            
            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper does not describe a specific AI health application. Instead, its analysis of global AI governance frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act) directly informs the ethical and equitable development and deployment of a wide range of AI health applications, such as diagnostic tools, personalized medicine systems, predictive analytics for patient care, and public health surveillance systems, by influencing the regulatory environment they operate within.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>The study systematically examines various international AI governance frameworks, including binding regulations (EU AI Act), soft law instruments (UNESCO Recommendations), and global initiatives (GPAI), for their approach to gender issues.</li>
                    
                    <li>Emerging trends in AI governance include the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a clear shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and an increasing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity.</li>
                    
                    <li>Significant gaps persist, notably inconsistent treatment of gender across different governance documents and limited engagement with intersectionality in policy design and implementation.</li>
                    
                    <li>A critical shortfall is the lack of robust enforcement mechanisms, hindering the effective implementation of gender-sensitive AI principles.</li>
                    
                    <li>The paper advocates strongly that effective AI governance must be designed to be intersectional, rigorously enforceable, and inclusively representative.</li>
                    
                    <li>The overarching goal is to move beyond tokenistic gestures, ensuring meaningful equity in AI development and deployment to actively prevent the reinforcement of existing gender-based inequalities.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a comprehensive analytical review of international AI governance frameworks, including binding regulations (e.g., EU AI Act), soft law instruments (e.g., UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics), and global initiatives (e.g., Global Partnership on AI - GPAI), to identify and evaluate how they address gender issues and gender-based harms.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Analysis reveals a dual landscape: positive trends such as the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks and an emphasis on inclusivity are emerging. However, significant shortcomings persist, including inconsistent gender treatment across various governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a notable absence of robust enforcement mechanisms.</p>

            </div>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Lack of gender-sensitive and intersectional AI governance directly impacts clinical practice by potentially embedding biases into diagnostic tools, predictive analytics for disease risk, and treatment algorithms. This could lead to suboptimal care, misdiagnosis rates varying by gender or intersectional identity, and unequal access to AI-driven health interventions, thereby worsening patient outcomes and widening health disparities in medical settings.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract highlights critical gaps *within the existing AI governance frameworks themselves*, specifically noting inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality in their design, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms to ensure their effectiveness, rather than limitations of the study's own methodology or scope.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Implicitly, the paper calls for future research and policy development focused on crafting AI governance frameworks that are explicitly intersectional, demonstrably enforceable, and comprehensively inclusive. This includes exploring effective mechanisms for incorporating diverse perspectives, establishing strong oversight, and developing strategies to translate policy into meaningful equity in AI development and deployment, particularly within critical sectors like healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper examines how international AI governance frameworks address gender issues and gender-based harms. The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms. However, this paper argues that effective AI governance must be intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive. This is key to moving beyond tokenism toward meaningful equity and preventing reinforcement of existing inequalities. The study contributes to ethical AI debates by highlighting the importance of gender-sensitive governance in building a just technological future.</p>
