                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces PF-DAformer, a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework designed for robust proximal femur segmentation in multi-institutional Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) scans. It addresses the critical challenge of domain shift, where deep learning models fail when applied across different datasets, by integrating adversarial and statistical alignment strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone. The goal is to ensure stable and reproducible bone density analyses for fracture risk assessment, regardless of variations in scanning equipment or patient demographics across institutions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes the development of a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework (PF-DAformer) using AI (deep learning, adversarial and statistical alignment) for medical image analysis. Specifically, it applies AI to automatically segment the proximal femur in QCT scans, which is crucial for quantitative assessment of bone density distribution to determine bone strength and fracture risk.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.</p>
