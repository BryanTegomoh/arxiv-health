                    <p>Key findings include the observation of two Hopf bifurcations in the absence of seasonal forcing, indicating conditions for periodic epidemic solutions. When seasonal forcing is introduced, the model reveals complex interactions between forcing strength and effective antibody decay, leading to diverse dynamic outcomes such as multi-year periodicity, quasiperiodicity, and chaos. The timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics are highly sensitive to these interactions. Importantly, seasonal forcing can cause resonant amplification or damping, significantly altering the cumulative infection burden compared to non-forced scenarios.</p>

This improved predictability enables better resource allocation for healthcare systems (e.g., ICU beds, staffing, vaccine distribution) and optimization of public health interventions like vaccination campaign timing, ultimately aiming to mitigate the societal and healthcare burden of seasonal epidemics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In temperate regions, respiratory virus epidemics recur on a yearly basis, primarily during the winter season. This is believed to be induced by seasonal forcing, where the rate at which the virus can be transmitted varies cyclically across the course of each year. Seasonal epidemics can place substantial burden upon the healthcare system, with large numbers of infections and hospitalisations occurring across a short time period. However, the interactions between seasonal forcing and the factors necessary for epidemic resurgence - such as waning immunity, antigenic variation or demography - remain poorly understood. In this manuscript, we examine how the dynamics of antibody waning and antigenic variation can shape the seasonal recurrence of epidemics. We develop a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) immuno-epidemiological model of respiratory virus spread, where the susceptible population is stratified by their antibody level against the currently circulating strain of the virus, with this decaying as both antibody waning and antigenic drift occur. In the absence of seasonal forcing, we demonstrate the existence of two Hopf bifurcations over the effective antibody decay rate, with associated periodic model solutions. When seasonal forcing is introduced, we identify complex interactions between the strength of forcing and the effective antibody decay rate, yielding myriad dynamics including multi-year periodicity, quasiperiodicity and chaos. The timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics is highly sensitive to this interaction, with the distribution of infection timing (by time of year) varying substantially across the parameter space. Finally, we show that seasonal forcing can produce resonant amplification (or damping) resulting in a cumulative infection burdens that is greater (or lesser) than would otherwise be observed.</p>
