The loss function is a smoothing-regularized binary cross-entropy, augmented with a variance penalty applied across multiple stochastic forward passes to enforce spatial coherence and reduce noisy fluctuations in the predicted segmentation masks.</p>

                <p>The enhanced accuracy and spatial coherence of brain tumor segmentations provided by UAMSA-UNet can directly improve clinical workflows by offering more reliable tumor volume and boundary estimations. This leads to more precise surgical planning, optimized radiation therapy dose distribution, and better assessment of tumor progression or regression, ultimately benefiting patient care and potentially reducing treatment-related morbidities. The improved computational efficiency also makes the model more practical for integration into clinical systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.</p>
