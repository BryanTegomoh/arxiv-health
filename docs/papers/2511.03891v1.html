                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition (CoImg), a novel deep learning approach that fuses multiple images of the same diagnostic class into composite visual inputs to enhance intra-class variance and information density. Applied to an imbalanced Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal dataset, this method significantly improved diagnostic performance. By creating a balanced dataset (Co-OCTDL) where each sample is a 3x1 composite image, the authors achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) and substantially lower false prediction rates compared to a baseline model trained on raw data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology is Class-Based Input Image Composition (CoImg). This involves programmatically fusing multiple input images belonging to the same diagnostic class into a single composite visual representation, typically arranged in a defined layout (e.g., 3x1). For evaluation, the authors applied this to the OCTDL dataset to create Co-OCTDL, a perfectly class-balanced version where each original scan was replaced by a CoImg formed from multiple scans of its corresponding class. A VGG16 deep learning model was then trained independently on both the original OCTDL and the Co-OCTDL datasets, ensuring identical model architecture and hyperparameters for a fair comparative analysis of diagnostic performance.</p>

                    <p>The proposed Class-Based Input Image Composition method, when applied to create the Co-OCTDL dataset, led to a substantial improvement in diagnostic performance.

                <p>This research has significant potential clinical impact by enhancing the reliability and robustness of AI-powered diagnostic tools in clinical settings. Particularly beneficial for ophthalmology, where OCT imaging is routine, it enables more accurate detection and classification of retinal diseases even when training data is scarce or unevenly distributed. Improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced false predictions can support earlier and more precise clinical decisions, optimize patient management, and potentially facilitate broader adoption of AI in diagnostics, especially in areas with limited access to specialized expertise.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.</p>
