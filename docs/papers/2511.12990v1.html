                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework for robustly analyzing topological variability in weighted brain networks by combining combinatorial Hodge decomposition with Wasserstein variance minimization. The method quantifies topological disparity using the 2-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams, demonstrating superior noise suppression and heightened sensitivity to genuine structural differences compared to traditional raw-edge weight analysis. It was successfully applied to differentiate functional brain networks between cannabis users and non-users in an ADHD dataset.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more robust and sensitive method for identifying subtle, genuine structural differences in brain networks, which is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis, discovering novel biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric conditions, and assessing the impact of substance use on brain function.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper presents a quantitative methodological framework rather than a specific AI application, the advanced computational techniques (e.g., topological data analysis, Wasserstein distance) used to identify topological variability in brain networks could serve as foundational components for developing AI-driven diagnostic tools, predictive models, or personalized treatment stratification approaches in psychiatry and neurology. Such methods can generate novel features for machine learning models aimed at identifying biomarkers for ADHD or assessing the neurobiological effects of substance use.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This work introduces a novel framework for testing topological variability in weighted networks by combining Hodge decomposition with Wasserstein variance minimization. Traditional approaches that analyze raw edge weights are susceptible to noise driven perturbations, limiting their ability to detect meaningful structural differences between network populations. Network signals are decomposed into various components using combinatorial Hodge theory, then topological disparity is quantified via the 2-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. The test statistic measures variance reduction when comparing within group to between group dispersions in the Wasserstein space. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method suppresses small random perturbations while maintaining sensitivity to genuine topological differences, particularly when applied to Hodge decomposed flows rather than raw edge weights. The framework is applied to functional brain networks from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD dataset, comparing cannabis users and non-users</p>
