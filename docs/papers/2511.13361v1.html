                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedDCR employs a closed-loop, agent-based learning framework. A 'Designer' agent proposes multi-step coding workflows. A 'Coder' agent executes these workflows on free-text clinical notes to convert them into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes. A 'Reflector' agent evaluates the Coder's predictions against ground truth and provides constructive feedback for improvement. This feedback loop, combined with a 'memory archive' that stores and reuses successful workflow designs, enables systematic learning and iterative refinement of optimal coding workflows.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.</p>
