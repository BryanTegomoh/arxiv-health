                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study demonstrates the utility of Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) in improving the prediction of routine health programmatic outputs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where traditional data are often constrained. By synthesizing diverse spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings, GeoFMs, particularly a Multi-GeoFM approach, enhanced predictive performance for key health indicators compared to baseline geostatistical methods. The research concludes that integrating multiple GeoFM sources can efficiently supplement and strengthen routine health information systems in resource-limited settings.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for public health in LMICs by offering a solution to unreliable and incomplete routine health data, which hinders effective health planning and resource allocation. Improved data predictions can lead to more targeted interventions, better monitoring of disease burden, and enhanced program evaluation in areas most in need.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper applies Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) and XGBoost, which are AI/machine learning techniques, to predict critical health programmatic outputs and demographic indicators (e.g., new HIV cases, child vaccinations, population density) from diverse spatial, temporal, and behavioral data. The application aims to enhance the reliability and coverage of health information systems in LMICs, thereby improving data-driven decision-making for public health interventions and healthcare resource allocation.</p>

                    <p>GeoFM embedding-based approaches surpassed baseline geostatistical methods for 13 of 15 (87%) indicators. The integrated Multi-GeoFM model demonstrated the most robust predictive power, achieving average 5-fold cross-validated R2 values of 0.63 (test R2 0.64) for population density, 0.57 (test R2 0.68) for new HIV cases, and 0.47 (test R2 0.55) for child vaccinations. However, prediction accuracy was notably poor for indicators with low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This approach offers a practical and efficient method to enhance data-driven decision-making in LMICs, critical for public health initiatives. By providing more reliable and timely estimates of health indicators (e.g., HIV prevalence, vaccination coverage), health programs can be better planned, resources allocated more effectively, and interventions targeted to specific populations, potentially leading to improved health outcomes and more resilient health systems.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The predictive performance was mixed, with improvements being described as 'modest' for select outcomes. A significant limitation was the poor prediction for targets with low primary data availability (e.g., TB and malnutrition cases), indicating that GeoFMs are most effective when a foundational level of primary data exists. The study was also confined to a single country (Malawi).</p>

Exploring methods to improve predictions for indicators with very low primary data availability would also be a crucial next step.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.</p>
