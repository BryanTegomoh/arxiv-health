                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The enhanced predictive capacity for health outcomes and population dynamics can lead to more efficient and equitable allocation of limited health resources, facilitating better planning of vaccination campaigns, more targeted HIV prevention and treatment programs, and improved public health surveillance in LMICs. This contributes to more effective public health interventions, stronger responses to disease outbreaks, and ultimately, better health outcomes for vulnerable populations.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The predictive performance of the models was mixed across indicators. Notably, prediction was poor for health targets characterized by low primary data availability, such as tuberculosis (TB) and malnutrition cases. This suggests that the utility of GeoFM embeddings can be constrained by the inherent data scarcity for certain specific health indicators.</p>

This implicitly suggests future research could focus on further validation, expansion of these methodologies to a wider range of health indicators and other LMIC contexts, and potentially their integration into operational health data systems to routinely inform decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.</p>
