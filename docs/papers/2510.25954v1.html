                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study validated Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) for predicting 15 routine health programmatic outputs in Malawi, addressing the challenges of unreliable health data in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The research demonstrated that embedding-based GeoFM approaches, particularly a multi-source integration model, significantly improved prediction accuracy over traditional geostatistical methods for most indicators, offering a novel tool to strengthen constrained health information systems.</p>

                <p>The enhanced predictive capabilities offered by GeoFMs can lead to more effective and equitable health service delivery in LMICs. Clinicians and public health practitioners can leverage these insights for better resource allocation (e.g., vaccine distribution, antiretroviral therapy clinics), targeted intervention planning (e.g., HIV prevention campaigns), and more efficient monitoring of programmatic outputs, ultimately improving patient outcomes and public health coverage where traditional data is scarce.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.</p>
