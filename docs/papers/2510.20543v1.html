                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces CenterBench, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language models' ability to distinguish true structural understanding from mere semantic pattern matching in complex, center-embedded sentences. By comparing performance on syntactically identical but semantically plausible versus implausible sentences, the study quantifies that models increasingly abandon structural analysis for semantic shortcuts as linguistic complexity grows. The findings highlight a critical limitation in current language models, particularly concerning their reliable interpretation of causal relationships independent of semantic coherence.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In medicine, where precise interpretation of complex clinical narratives, diagnostic reports, and research literature is paramount, an LLM's reliance on semantic shortcuts rather than true syntactic understanding can lead to critical misinterpretations, flawed diagnoses, or unsafe treatment recommendations. This research provides a crucial framework to diagnose and quantify such limitations, ensuring safer and more reliable AI deployment in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper does not present a direct medical AI application, but its findings are directly applicable to the development, evaluation, and responsible deployment of *any* AI system in health or medicine that relies on language understanding. For instance, an AI designed to analyze patient electronic health records for diagnostic insights, synthesize medical literature for treatment recommendations, or answer patient queries, could be significantly impacted by the structural understanding failures and semantic shortcuts identified in this research. The methodology (CenterBench) could also inspire specific evaluations for medical LMs to ensure their robustness in high-stakes clinical scenarios.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed CenterBench, a dataset comprising 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences, ranging from simple to deeply nested structures. For each sentence, a syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart was generated (e.g., 'mailmen prescribe medicine' vs. 'doctors deliver mail'). Six question types were designed per sentence to assess surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning. Six diverse language models were evaluated on this dataset under both plausible and implausible conditions, with their performance gaps systematically analyzed across varying sentence complexities. Human performance was also measured for comparative analysis.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Language models consistently exhibit a widening performance gap on semantically plausible sentences as syntactic complexity increases, demonstrating a shift from structural analysis to statistical semantic associations. This gap, quantified up to 26.8 percentage points, signifies when models abandon precise parsing for shortcuts. Notably, semantic plausibility detrimentally impacts performance on questions requiring causal reasoning, where the model prioritizes general coherence over specific causal links. While 'reasoning' models show higher accuracy, they still employ semantic shortcuts, display 'overthinking' behaviors, and sometimes refuse to answer. Humans, in contrast, demonstrate more variable and less systematically predictable semantic effects.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The inherent tendency of language models to abandon structural analysis for semantic shortcuts as complexity rises poses a significant risk in clinical applications. For instance, an LLM used for clinical decision support might misinterpret a nuanced patient history or a complex drug interaction described in a syntactically intricate sentence, if it defaults to semantically common (but contextually incorrect) associations. This could lead to incorrect diagnostic suggestions, inappropriate treatment plans, or overlooked critical safety information. The findings underscore the urgent need for more robust evaluation and development of LLMs for high-stakes medical contexts, emphasizing true syntactic understanding over superficial pattern matching to ensure patient safety and data accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, potential limitations include the focus solely on center-embedded sentence structures, which may not encompass the full range of syntactic complexities encountered in real-world medical texts. Additionally, the evaluation was conducted on a specific set of six language models, and the findings might not generalize universally to all current and future LLM architectures or specialized medical NLP models.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The CenterBench framework is presented as a foundational tool, suggesting future research directions such as using it to evaluate a broader spectrum of advanced LLM architectures and training paradigms. Further work could explore mitigation strategies for semantic shortcutting, develop models with more robust structural understanding, and apply similar systematic evaluation methods to other forms of complex medical language to enhance reliability in clinical AI applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.</p>
