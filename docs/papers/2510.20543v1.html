                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces CenterBench, a novel dataset designed to evaluate when language models (LMs) abandon structural syntactic analysis in favor of semantic pattern matching. It demonstrates that LMs systematically prioritize semantic plausibility over precise syntactic understanding as sentence complexity increases, revealing a fundamental difference in how models and humans process complex language structures.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Language models are increasingly deployed in healthcare for tasks like clinical decision support and EHR analysis. This research is crucial because it highlights that these models might misinterpret complex medical texts, prioritizing 'common sense' semantic associations over precise, syntactically nuanced clinical information, potentially leading to diagnostic errors or suboptimal treatment recommendations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper's insights are vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of AI systems in healthcare. Specifically, for LMs used in clinical settings, these findings inform the need for better architectural designs and evaluation metrics that prioritize accurate structural and causal reasoning over superficial semantic plausibility. Developers of medical AI applications must account for these identified failure modes to prevent misinterpretations of complex medical histories, diagnostic criteria, or treatment protocols. This research can guide the development of more robust AI for tasks such as summarizing patient records, answering complex clinical questions, or supporting diagnostic processes where precise understanding of nested dependencies and causal relationships is paramount for patient care.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved creating CenterBench, a dataset comprising 9,720 comprehension questions. This dataset features center-embedded sentences with varying depths of recursion, each presented in a semantically plausible version and a syntactically identical, semantically implausible version. Six types of questions were developed to assess different aspects of comprehension (surface, syntactic dependencies, causal reasoning). Six different language models were then evaluated on this dataset, and their performance was analyzed, comparing accuracy on plausible vs. implausible sentences and across different complexity levels. Human performance was also used as a benchmark for comparison.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Language models exhibit a significant and systematic increase in reliance on semantic plausibility, rather than structural understanding, as syntactic complexity (nesting depth) of sentences grows. This results in performance gaps up to 26.8 percentage points between plausible and implausible sentences. Intriguingly, semantic plausibility negatively impacts performance on questions requiring causal reasoning. While reasoning models improve overall accuracy, they still display evidence of semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer refusal, indicating persistent challenges in robust structural analysis.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>In clinical settings, misinterpreting complex medical language (e.g., in patient histories, surgical notes, or research papers) can have severe consequences. If LMs prioritize common semantic patterns over precise syntax, they could misinterpret drug interactions, patient symptoms, or treatment protocols. For instance, an LM might wrongly infer a common condition based on keywords, overlooking a rare, complex diagnosis described with intricate sentence structure. This study provides a framework to identify and potentially mitigate such biases, which is critical for the safe and reliable deployment of AI in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily focuses on center-embedded sentences, which represent a specific type of syntactic complexity, and the findings might not generalize perfectly to all forms of complex grammatical structures. The study also evaluated a specific set of six language models, and results may vary with other or future models. The abstract does not explicitly state limitations regarding dataset size or scope beyond the specific sentence type.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on developing language models that can maintain robust structural understanding irrespective of semantic plausibility, especially for complex and nuanced text. Applying the CenterBench framework to evaluate domain-specific medical LMs on medical-specific syntactically complex sentences could reveal further insights. Research into architectural changes or training methodologies to reduce semantic shortcutting and improve genuine causal and syntactic reasoning in LMs is warranted.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.</p>
