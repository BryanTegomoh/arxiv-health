                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research introduces CenterBench, a novel dataset designed to meticulously evaluate when large language models (LLMs) abandon deep syntactic parsing for superficial semantic pattern matching. By testing models on center-embedded sentences with both plausible and implausible semantics across varying complexity levels, the study quantifies performance gaps, revealing that models increasingly rely on semantic shortcuts as linguistic complexity grows. The framework provides a critical tool to distinguish genuine structural understanding from associative reasoning in AI systems.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for the safe and effective deployment of AI in medicine, as it provides a method to assess whether language models genuinely understand complex medical language or merely rely on superficial semantic associations. In high-stakes clinical settings, misinterpreting syntactically complex medical notes (e.g., patient history, drug interactions, diagnostic criteria) due to semantic shortcuts could lead to serious errors, making this diagnostic framework vital for validating AI reliability.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research helps in developing robust, reliable, and safe AI systems for healthcare. By exposing when language models prioritize semantic patterns over syntactic structure, it provides critical insights for evaluating and improving AI performance in interpreting complex medical information. This understanding can guide the design of more resilient medical AI applications that can accurately process patient data, clinical notes, research papers, and diagnostic reports, thereby reducing the risk of errors that could arise from misinterpreting causal relationships or complex dependencies in medical text. It also informs testing methodologies for ensuring the trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical scenarios.</p>

                    <li>A new dataset, CenterBench, comprising 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences, was developed to probe syntactic understanding.</li>
                    
                    <li>Sentences vary in syntactic complexity (depth of nesting) and are provided in two versions: semantically plausible (e.g., 'dog chases cat') and semantically implausible (e.g., 'mailmen prescribe medicine'), while maintaining identical syntax.</li>
                    
                    <li>Six types of comprehension questions assess different levels of understanding, including surface meaning, syntactic dependencies (e.g., subject-verb agreement), and causal reasoning.</li>
                    
                    <li>Performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences systematically widen with increased linguistic complexity, reaching up to 26.8 percentage points, indicating when models prioritize semantic shortcuts over structural analysis.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study created CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720 comprehension questions based on center-embedded sentences. Sentences varied in syntactic nesting depth and were generated in both semantically plausible and implausible versions (e.g., 'The cat that the dog chased meowed' vs. 'The dog that the cat meowed chased'). Six types of questions were developed for each sentence to test surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning. Six different language models were then evaluated on this dataset to measure their performance and the performance gap between plausible and implausible scenarios, systematically analyzing how this gap changes with increasing sentence complexity.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Language models exhibit a systematic widening of performance gaps (up to 26.8 percentage points) between semantically plausible and implausible sentences as syntactic complexity increases, quantifying their shift from structural analysis to semantic shortcuts. Interestingly, semantic plausibility can detrimentally affect performance on causal reasoning questions. While 'reasoning models' show better accuracy, they still display signs of semantic shortcutting, excessive processing, or answer refusal. Humans, in contrast, demonstrate more variable effects of semantic plausibility.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings underscore a critical need for rigorous evaluation of AI models in healthcare, particularly in tasks involving complex clinical text. By identifying when models prioritize semantic associations over accurate structural parsing, CenterBench offers a framework to build more reliable medical AI. This can lead to safer clinical decision support systems, more accurate interpretation of patient records, and reduced risks of medical errors stemming from AI's superficial understanding of nuanced medical language.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly list specific limitations. However, potential implicit limitations could include the focus on a single type of complex syntactic structure (center-embedding), the specific set of models tested (not detailed in the abstract), or the synthetic nature of the dataset, despite its targeted design to isolate specific linguistic phenomena.</p>

                <p>The introduction of CenterBench as 'the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching' strongly implies future work on using this framework to: (1) comprehensively diagnose and benchmark a wider array of language models, (2) guide the development of new model architectures and training methodologies that improve genuine structural understanding, (3) further investigate the differences between human and AI language processing mechanisms, and (4) validate the robustness of AI systems in high-stakes domains like medicine by ensuring deep comprehension beyond superficial plausibility.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.</p>
