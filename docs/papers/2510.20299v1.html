                    <p>The study proposes DB-FGA-Net, a deep learning architecture utilizing a dual-backbone approach by integrating VGG16 and Xception models to extract comprehensive features. A custom Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block is then employed to fuse these features, allowing the capture of both local and global image characteristics. The model is designed for multi-class brain tumor classification (2, 3, and 4 classes) and is trained without data augmentation to assess inherent robustness. Grad-CAM is integrated post-hoc for interpretability, visualizing crucial regions for predictions. Performance is rigorously evaluated on the 7K-DS and an independent 3K-DS dataset. A graphical user interface (GUI) was also developed to facilitate real-time clinical application.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.</p>
