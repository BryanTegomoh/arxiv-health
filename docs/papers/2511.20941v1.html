                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel hybrid statistical testing strategy, MMD-FUSE, which fuses classical and quantum kernels to improve two-sample tests, particularly for small and high-dimensional datasets. The approach enhances the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) framework by combining the unique expressive power of quantum kernels with the domain-specific biases of classical kernels. Experiments on synthetic and real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that this hybrid method achieves superior test power and remarkable robustness compared to classical counterparts.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper presents MMD-FUSE, a novel hybrid statistical test that fuses classical and quantum kernels to perform robust two-sample tests. In health and medicine, this AI-driven approach can be applied to: 
1.  **Drug Efficacy/Safety Evaluation:** Accurately comparing outcomes (e.g., lab results, patient reported outcomes) between a drug treatment group and a control group in clinical trials to determine if the drug has a statistically significant effect, especially crucial for early-stage trials or rare disease studies with small cohorts. 
2.  **Biomarker Discovery and Validation:** Identifying significant differences in biomarker distributions (e.g., gene expression, protein levels) between healthy and diseased individuals, or between responders and non-responders to a therapy, aiding in diagnostic development or personalized treatment strategies. 
3.  **Clinical Decision Support:** Enhancing the statistical power and robustness of analyses used in clinical research, particularly when dealing with complex, high-dimensional patient data (e.g., multi-omics data) where traditional statistical methods might struggle due to small sample sizes. 
4.  **Real-world Evidence Analysis:** Comparing patient populations from real-world data to assess treatment effectiveness or identify risk factors, even with inherent data limitations. 
This method leverages advanced machine learning (kernel methods) and quantum computing principles to provide more effective statistical tools for data analysis in critical medical contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.</p>
