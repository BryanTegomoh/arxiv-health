                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper provides a comprehensive overview of active visual perception, a paradigm where systems dynamically interact with their environment through sensing and action to acquire more informative data, unlike passive visual systems. It explores the significant opportunities this approach offers across various applications, including robotics and human-computer interaction, while also detailing the critical challenges that must be addressed for its widespread adoption. The review highlights the potential of active systems to overcome limitations of static sensing in complex environments by actively directing attention and interacting with objects.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Active visual perception holds substantial promise for advancing medical technologies by enabling systems to actively seek, analyze, and interact with clinical environments or patient data. This allows for more precise diagnostics, safer surgical interventions, and more adaptive assistive and rehabilitation devices, moving beyond static visual data analysis to dynamic, context-aware interaction.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Active visual perception would enable medical AI systems and robots to dynamically interact with and adapt to complex, dynamic, and often uncertain medical environments. For example, a surgical robot equipped with active perception could actively adjust its camera angles and focus to optimally visualize anatomical structures or pathologies during an operation, improving precision and safety. An AI-powered diagnostic endoscope could actively explore internal organs, deciding where to move or focus to acquire the most informative visual data for diagnosis. In biosecurity, robotic systems with active visual perception could more effectively monitor high-containment laboratories for spills or unauthorized access, or safely handle hazardous biological materials by actively seeking optimal grip points or trajectories. For patient monitoring, an AI system could actively track a patient's movements or physiological indicators, dynamically adjusting sensor focus to better detect critical events like falls, changes in posture indicative of distress, or subtle symptom progression.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Active visual perception refers to the ability of a system to dynamically engage with its environment through sensing and action, allowing it to modify its behavior in response to specific goals or uncertainties. Unlike passive systems that rely solely on visual data, active visual perception systems can direct attention, move sensors, or interact with objects to acquire more informative data. This approach is particularly powerful in complex environments where static sensing methods may not provide sufficient information. Active visual perception plays a critical role in numerous applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems. However, despite its significant promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including real-time processing of complex visual data, decision-making in dynamic environments, and integrating multimodal sensory inputs. This paper explores both the opportunities and challenges inherent in active visual perception, providing a comprehensive overview of its potential, current research, and the obstacles that must be overcome for broader adoption.</p>
