                <p class="summary-text">This study pioneers the direct classification of raw retinal OCT B-scan images using deep learning for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection, a novel approach for AD prediction. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank, fine-tuned pretrained models like ResNet-34 achieved an AUC of 0.62 for detection within four years of imaging. Explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield, establishing a baseline for this challenging task.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>While the current AUC of 0.62 is below the threshold for immediate clinical application, this study provides a vital proof-of-concept and baseline for non-invasive, OCT-based early AD detection. It suggests the potential for developing future screening tools that could identify individuals at risk for AD much earlier, facilitating early intervention strategies, although substantial further research is required.</p>

The study also points to the inherent challenges of working with a 'small, high-dimensional dataset' and the difficulty in detecting subtle retinal biomarkers several years prior to AD diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.</p>
