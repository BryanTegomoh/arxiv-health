                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Nuclei segmentation is the cornerstone task in histology image reading,
shedding light on the underlying molecular patterns and leading to disease or
cancer diagnosis. Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from
trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues
and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other
hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL)
models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This
work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised
pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology.
There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to
generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction
model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of
NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually
annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good
generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly
available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and
weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully
supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent
and explainable to physicians.</p>
