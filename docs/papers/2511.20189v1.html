                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel approach for identifying patient subgroups that exhibit the maximum average treatment effect, a critical challenge in precision medicine and other domains. By directly formulating the problem within the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework and assuming a partition-based data-generating model, the authors demonstrate that optimal subgroup discovery can be recast as a standard supervised learning task. Their method, instantiated with CART and avoiding ad-hoc causal heuristics, significantly outperforms existing baselines in accurately identifying target subgroups on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.
