                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>MelanomaNet is an explainable deep learning system designed for multi-class skin lesion classification from dermoscopic images. It functions as a medical AI application to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin conditions, including melanoma, by not only providing classifications but also offering interpretable explanations (e.g., aligning with ABCDE criteria) and flagging unreliable predictions for human clinical review. This enhances trust and integration into healthcare workflows.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated skin lesion classification using deep learning has shown remarkable accuracy, yet clinical adoption remains limited due to the "black box" nature of these models. We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories. Our model achieves 85.61% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.8564, while providing clinically meaningful explanations that align model attention with established dermatological assessment criteria. The uncertainty quantification module decomposes prediction confidence into epistemic and aleatoric components, enabling automatic flagging of unreliable predictions for clinical review. Our results demonstrate that high classification performance can be achieved alongside comprehensive interpretability, potentially facilitating greater trust and adoption in clinical dermatology workflows.
