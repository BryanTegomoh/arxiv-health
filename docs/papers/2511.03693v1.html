                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Colorectal cancer (CRC) grading is a critical prognostic factor but remains
hampered by inter-observer variability and the privacy constraints of
multi-institutional data sharing. While deep learning offers a path to
automation, centralized training models conflict with data governance
regulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In
this work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)
framework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature
learning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a
dual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear
detail and broader tissue-level context. This architecture is integrated into a
robust FL system stabilized using FedProx to mitigate client drift across
heterogeneous data distributions from multiple hospitals. Extensive evaluation
on the CRC-HGD dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an overall
accuracy of 83.5%, outperforming a comparable centralized model (81.6%).
Crucially, the system excels in identifying the most aggressive Grade III
tumors with a high recall of 87.5%, a key clinical priority to prevent
dangerous false negatives. Performance further improves with higher
magnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x. These results validate that our
federated multi-scale approach not only preserves patient privacy but also
enhances model performance and generalization. The proposed modular pipeline,
with built-in preprocessing, checkpointing, and error handling, establishes a
foundational step toward deployable, privacy-aware clinical AI for digital
pathology.</p>
