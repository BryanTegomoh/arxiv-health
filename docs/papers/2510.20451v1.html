                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) from observational data when the standard unconfoundedness assumption, crucial for causal inference, is violated. It introduces a proximal causal inference framework to overcome this limitation, proposing novel nonparametric identification methods, establishing a semiparametric efficiency bound, and developing a (K+1)-robust estimation method for learning optimal DTRs, with K representing the number of treatment stages.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dynamic treatment regimes are sequential decision rules that adapt treatment
according to individual time-varying characteristics and outcomes to achieve
optimal effects, with applications in precision medicine, personalized
recommendations, and dynamic marketing. Estimating optimal dynamic treatment
regimes via sequential randomized trials might face costly and ethical hurdles,
often necessitating the use of historical observational data. In this work, we
utilize proximal causal inference framework for learning optimal dynamic
treatment regimes when the unconfoundedness assumption fails. Our contributions
are four-fold: (i) we propose three nonparametric identification methods for
optimal dynamic treatment regimes; (ii) we establish the semiparametric
efficiency bound for the value function of a given regime; (iii) we propose a
(K+1)-robust method for learning optimal dynamic treatment regimes, where K is
the number of stages; (iv) as a by-product for marginal structural models, we
establish identification and estimation of counterfactual means under a static
regime. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and multiple robustness
of our proposed methods.</p>
