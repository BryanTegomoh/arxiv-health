It demonstrates how analyzing angle-dependent reflection coefficients, critical angles, and waveform distortions can separate density from speed of sound mismatches and determine the thickness of intermediate layers, even at subwavelength resolution, which has significant implications for medical diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">More than a century ago, Karl Bernhard Zoeppritz derived the equations that
determine the reflected and transmitted coefficients at a planar interface for
an incident seismic wave. The coefficients so obtained are a function of the
elastic parameters of the media on each side of the interface and the angle of
incidence. Approximations of the equations have been proposed and used in
geophysical exploration, however, full use of the equations and their
generalization to multiple layers could offer richer information about the
properties of the media and be helpful in medical diagnosis via ultrasound. In
this work, we investigate how to extract information from the angle-dependent
reflection coefficients, including critical angles and the wave distortion at
the interface between two and three media. It is shown that it is possible to
separate the effect of density from speed of sound mismatch by measuring
amplitudes as a function of angle of incidence (AVA). And examining the
critical angle and waveform distortion of the reflected waves can reveal the
thickness of an intermediate layer, even with subwavelength resolution. These
studies could be integrated into medical imaging and also into the training of
artificial intelligence systems that assist in diagnosis. In particular, they
could help prevent cerebrovascular accidents by early detection of the
formation and hardening of plaque in the arteries that irrigate the brain.</p>
