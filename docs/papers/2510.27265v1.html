                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a novel, backpropagation-free framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medical imaging that dynamically merges a robust generalist model with a precise expert model. T^3 computes per-sample interpolation coefficients using Jensen-Shannon divergence between model output distributions, addressing the challenge of maintaining accuracy across diverse medical modalities and under modality shift. An efficient batch-wise extension, T^3_B, is also proposed to reduce computational costs.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), which is a backpropagation-free approach. For each input sample, T^3 dynamically calculates an interpolation coefficient between a generalist and an expert VLM. This coefficient is derived from the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output probability distributions, allowing for adaptive weighting. To mitigate the inference costs associated with per-sample computation, a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, is proposed, which computes a single merging coefficient for an entire batch of samples. A comprehensive cross-evaluation protocol was established for rigorous testing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is
