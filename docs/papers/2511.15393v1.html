                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">EVA-Net is a novel framework designed for interpretable brain age prediction from EEG, addressing the challenges of imperfect medical data and the black-box nature of existing models. It recasts brain age as an anomaly detection problem, leveraging a Transformer for long EEG sequences, a Variational Information Bottleneck for robust representations, and a continuous prototype network to explicitly learn the normative healthy aging manifold. The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in healthy subjects and accurately identifies deviations in MCI and AD patients through elevated brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error.</p>

                    <p>EVA-Net is a deep learning framework comprising an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer for processing long EEG sequences. It integrates a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to extract a robust, compressed feature representation from noisy input data.

Critically, in an unseen validation cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients, the model identified significantly higher brain-age gaps and introduced a novel 'Prototype Alignment Error'.

                <p>This interpretable framework offers a transparent diagnostic aid for clinicians, potentially enabling earlier and more reliable identification of individuals at risk of or suffering from neurodegenerative conditions like MCI and AD by detecting significant deviations from normative brain aging using EEG. It could improve patient stratification, guide personalized therapeutic strategies, and facilitate objective monitoring of disease progression, particularly given the accessibility of EEG.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The brain age is a key indicator of brain health. While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold. EVA-Net provides an interpretable framework for healthcare intelligence using imperfect medical data.</p>
