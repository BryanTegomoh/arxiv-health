                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes novel deep learning models based on a modified Transformer architecture designed to integrate external graphs of dependencies between tabular data samples, a feature often missing in conventional models. The core innovation lies in a 'relationship-aware' attention mechanism that adds a term to account for these connections, particularly useful for tasks like treatment effect estimation. The models' performance is evaluated in regression tasks on synthetic and real-world datasets, and in treatment effect estimation using the IHDP dataset, with comparisons to Gradient Boosting Decision Trees.</p>

                    <p>The methodology centers on modifying the Transformer architecture by introducing a specialized 'relationship-aware' attention mechanism.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models for tabular data typically do not allow for imposing a graph of external dependencies between samples, which can be useful for accounting for relatedness in tasks such as treatment effect estimation. Graph neural networks only consider adjacent nodes, making them difficult to apply to sparse graphs. This paper proposes several solutions based on a modified attention mechanism, which accounts for possible relationships between data points by adding a term to the attention matrix. Our models are compared with each other and the gradient boosting decision trees in a regression task on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as in a treatment effect estimation task on the IHDP dataset.</p>
