                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel state-of-the-art method that effectively suppresses epileptic seizure activity by stabilizing fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. The technique successfully suppressed 34 out of 35 spontaneous seizures with a 49% average amplitude reduction in controlled signals, while also distinguishing four epileptic brain states based on fractal behavior and stability properties.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research offers a promising new direction for treating medically refractory epilepsy, potentially enabling patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance overall social and vocational outcomes by directly suppressing seizure activity.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a method that models complex biological data (intracranial EEG) to characterize epileptic states and develop simulated controlled signals for seizure suppression. This involves advanced computational techniques, likely encompassing signal processing, pattern recognition, and control theory. While 'AI' is not explicitly mentioned, such methods often form the basis for medical AI applications, particularly in neurotechnology, brain-computer interfaces, and real-time predictive or therapeutic systems for neurological disorders. This could be considered an application of advanced computational intelligence, a precursor or direct component of AI in medical diagnostics and therapeutics for seizure management.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</p>
