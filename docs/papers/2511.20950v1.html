                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks, modeled from intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, to effectively suppress epileptic seizure activity. The approach successfully suppressed 34 out of 35 spontaneous episodes with a substantial 49% average amplitude reduction in simulated controlled signals, demonstrating the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize and control seizure-related brain states.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research offers a promising novel therapeutic strategy for patients with medically refractory epilepsy, aiming to achieve seizure remission, improve psychological well-being, and enhance overall social and vocational outcomes, significantly reducing the burden of this debilitating condition.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a 'state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data' and performs 'multi-scale analysis' to characterize seizure-related brain states and suppress epileptic activity. This involves sophisticated computational modeling, signal processing, pattern recognition, and control systems applied to complex physiological data. While not explicitly stated as 'machine learning' or 'deep learning,' this type of advanced computational approach for analyzing biomedical signals, identifying medical states, predicting events (pre-ictal), and implementing therapeutic control (seizure suppression) falls squarely within the scope of medical AI applications, particularly in areas like intelligent neurostimulation, brain-computer interfaces for seizure management, or AI-driven diagnostics for neurological disorders.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</p>
