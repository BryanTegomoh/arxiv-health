                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method utilizing fractional dynamical networks, modeled from intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, to effectively suppress epileptic seizure activity. The approach successfully stabilized these networks, suppressing 34 out of 35 spontaneous seizure episodes and achieving a 49% average amplitude reduction in simulated controlled signals. Furthermore, the analysis of fractal behavior and stability properties of these networks can distinguish between all four epileptic brain states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal.</p>

                <p>This research offers a promising new approach to treating medically refractory epilepsy, a condition for which current treatments are often insufficient, by directly suppressing seizure activity. It could significantly improve quality of life for millions by providing a novel, potentially real-time, non-pharmacological intervention.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a computational method involving 'stabilizing fractional dynamical networks' and 'multi-scale analysis' of intracranial EEG data to suppress epileptic activity. This represents an advanced application of computational modeling and control theory to physiological data for a therapeutic outcome. While not explicitly framed as 'machine learning' or 'deep learning,' it employs sophisticated algorithmic approaches to analyze complex biological signals and intervene in disease processes, placing it firmly within the realm of advanced computational applications to health, and by extension, medical AI/applications in a broader sense of intelligent systems for health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</p>
