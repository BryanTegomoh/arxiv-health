                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a 'state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity.' This involves complex computational modeling and analysis of physiological signals (EEG) to understand and control a pathological biological process. While not explicitly using terms like 'machine learning' or 'deep learning,' the approach of modeling complex biological networks for predictive control and intervention falls under advanced computational methods in medicine, which can be considered an application of AI or AI-like algorithms in health. Specifically, it relates to the development of intelligent neuro-stimulation or brain-computer interface technologies aimed at real-time seizure detection and suppression based on dynamic network analysis.</p>

                    <p>The study involved modeling fractional dynamical networks using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. A stabilization method was applied to these networks to suppress seizure activity.

The effectiveness was quantified through the successful suppression of spontaneous seizure episodes and by simulating controlled signals to measure amplitude reduction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</p>
