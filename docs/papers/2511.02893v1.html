It utilized a subset of the BraTS dataset specific to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), comprising 60 multimodal MRI cases of glioma patients.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation is a critical achievement in modern medical
science, developed over decades of research. It allows for the exact
delineation of anatomical and pathological features in two- or
three-dimensional pictures by utilizing notions like pixel intensity, texture,
and anatomical context. With the advent of automated segmentation, physicians
and radiologists may now concentrate on diagnosis and treatment planning while
intelligent computers perform routine image processing tasks.
  This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of
the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with
glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances
performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of
360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial
anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In
contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online
augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better
results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation.
These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper
augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture
segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.</p>
