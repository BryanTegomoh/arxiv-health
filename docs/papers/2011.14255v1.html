                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates optimal vaccination programs for two infectious diseases exhibiting cross immunity, using a two-layer Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. It identifies three distinct scenarios for an optimal program that effectively prevents outbreaks of both diseases while minimizing vaccination costs. The research analytically derives a specific criterion to determine the optimal program based on the relative costs of the available vaccines.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a framework for public health decision-makers to optimize vaccine resource allocation for co-circulating diseases with immunological interactions, enabling more efficient and cost-effective outbreak prevention strategies in a real-world setting.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research paper does not describe an AI application. It uses a mathematical epidemiological model (SIR model) to analytically derive criteria for optimal vaccination programs. While such models can inform or be integrated into AI-driven decision support systems for public health, the paper itself is not about AI.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a two-layer Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) mathematical model to simulate the spread of two infectious diseases with cross immunity within a population.

                    <p>The research identified three specific scenarios for vaccination programs that optimally prevent outbreaks of both cross-immune diseases. A significant finding is the analytical derivation of a criterion that dictates the choice among these optimal programs, which is directly dependent on the relative costs of the vaccines available for the two diseases.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This model can inform public health policy by guiding strategic vaccine procurement and deployment when facing multiple, interacting disease threats. It offers a practical tool for health authorities to make evidence-based decisions on how to best allocate limited budgets and vaccine supplies to achieve maximal disease prevention, thereby potentially reducing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden during epidemics involving cross-immune pathogens (e.g., different influenza strains or related viral families).</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly list limitations. However, typical limitations for SIR models, which are not mentioned, include assumptions of homogeneous mixing within the population, fixed recovery rates, a lack of age or spatial structure, and neglecting factors like vaccine hesitancy or variable vaccine efficacy/durability. The simplified focus on "cost" might also overlook other practical constraints or ethical considerations in real-world vaccination campaigns.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state future research directions. Potential extensions could involve incorporating more complex epidemiological factors into the model, such as heterogeneous populations, age-specific vaccination, dynamic vaccine supply and demand, the impact of vaccine hesitancy, or exploring the robustness of the optimal programs under uncertainty in disease parameters or varying levels of cross-immunity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">There are often multiple diseases with cross immunity competing for vaccination resources. Here we investigate the optimal vaccination program in a two-layer Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, where two diseases with cross immunity spread in the same population, and vaccines for both diseases are available. We identify three scenarios of the optimal vaccination program, which prevents the outbreaks of both diseases at the minimum cost. We analytically derive a criterion to specify the optimal program based on the costs for different vaccines.</p>
