                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The paper investigates optimal vaccination strategies for two infectious diseases exhibiting cross immunity, competing for resources within the same population. Utilizing a two-layer Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, the authors identify three distinct scenarios for optimal vaccination programs aimed at preventing outbreaks of both diseases at minimum cost. A crucial analytical criterion, based on the costs of the respective vaccines, is derived to specify the most effective program.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a critical framework for public health policy makers to allocate scarce vaccination resources effectively when facing co-circulating infectious diseases with immunological cross-talk, ensuring maximum outbreak prevention at minimal economic burden. It directly informs strategies for optimizing public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself uses an analytical derivation rather than AI, the problem it addresses (optimal resource allocation for vaccination programs to prevent outbreaks) is highly amenable to AI/ML applications in health. AI could be used to:
1.  Develop more sophisticated epidemiological models by incorporating machine learning for better prediction of disease dynamics, including complex cross-immunity effects and real-world factors (e.g., population mobility, vaccine hesitancy).
2.  Utilize reinforcement learning or advanced optimization algorithms to dynamically determine optimal vaccination strategies in real-time settings, considering evolving disease characteristics, vaccine availability, supply chain constraints, and economic factors.
3.  Analyze large-scale population health data (e.g., electronic health records, genomic data) to inform and refine the parameters used in such optimal programs, moving beyond purely theoretical analytical derivations to data-driven and adaptive decision-making.</p>

                <p>This work has significant clinical and public health implications by offering a quantitative, evidence-based method to optimize vaccine deployment strategies. It can directly inform decisions on resource allocation in real-world settings, helping public health authorities achieve population-level immunity against multiple diseases more efficiently and cost-effectively, particularly in situations where vaccine supplies or funding are limited. This could lead to more targeted and impactful vaccination campaigns.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">There are often multiple diseases with cross immunity competing for vaccination resources. Here we investigate the optimal vaccination program in a two-layer Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, where two diseases with cross immunity spread in the same population, and vaccines for both diseases are available. We identify three scenarios of the optimal vaccination program, which prevents the outbreaks of both diseases at the minimum cost. We analytically derive a criterion to specify the optimal program based on the costs for different vaccines.</p>
