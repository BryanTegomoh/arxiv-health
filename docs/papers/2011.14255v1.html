                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">There are often multiple diseases with cross immunity competing for vaccination resources. Here we investigate the optimal vaccination program in a two-layer Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, where two diseases with cross immunity spread in the same population, and vaccines for both diseases are available. We identify three scenarios of the optimal vaccination program, which prevents the outbreaks of both diseases at the minimum cost. We analytically derive a criterion to specify the optimal program based on the costs for different vaccines.</p>
