                    <p>The proposed FGMamba model is a frequency-aware gated state-space model. Its architecture comprises two primary modules: 1) the **Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM)**, which integrates efficient state-space modeling with a dual-branch mechanism for spatial and channel attention to capture global dependencies and refine features; and 2) the **Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM)**, designed to extract and fuse high-frequency details across multiple resolutions using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for guided fusion. This design prioritizes lightweight architecture for computational efficiency.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>FGMamba achieved superior quantitative performance, indicated by higher PSNR and SSIM metrics, compared to existing CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-art super-resolution methods. This robust performance was validated across a diverse set of five medical imaging modalities: Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic imaging. Notably, FGMamba accomplished these results with a highly compact parameter footprint, demonstrating high computational efficiency with less than 0.75 million parameters.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The enhanced image quality and computational efficiency of FGMamba hold significant clinical impact. It can lead to more precise and earlier disease detection, improved surgical planning, and better monitoring of treatment responses by providing clearer diagnostic images. The ability to achieve high resolution from lower-resolution inputs can also reduce patient exposure to radiation (e.g., lower dose CT scans), shorten scanning times, and potentially lower healthcare costs associated with medical imaging, making high-quality diagnostics more accessible.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.</p>
