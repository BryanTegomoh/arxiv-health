                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The resolving ability of wide-field fluorescence microscopy is fundamentally
limited by out-of-focus background owing to its low axial resolution,
particularly for densely labeled biological samples. To address this, we
developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that
achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from
a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model
employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning
with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via
convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional
generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to
new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms
ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution
enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for
lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through
knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional
reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results.
ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input
image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial
super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy
algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great
potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology.</p>
