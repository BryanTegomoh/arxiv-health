                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate lung tumor segmentation is vital for improving diagnosis and
treatment planning, and effectively combining anatomical and functional
information from PET and CT remains a major challenge. In this study, we
propose vMambaX, a lightweight multimodal framework integrating PET and CT scan
images through a Context-Gated Cross-Modal Perception Module (CGM). Built on
the Visual Mamba architecture, vMambaX adaptively enhances inter-modality
feature interaction, emphasizing informative regions while suppressing noise.
Evaluated on the PCLT20K dataset, the model outperforms baseline models while
maintaining lower computational complexity. These results highlight the
effectiveness of adaptive cross-modal gating for multimodal tumor segmentation
and demonstrate the potential of vMambaX as an efficient and scalable framework
for advanced lung cancer analysis. The code is available at
