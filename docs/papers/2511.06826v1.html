                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DA4ICL, a novel demo-centric anchoring framework designed to enhance in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection from narrative transcripts. DA4ICL addresses the limitations of standard ICL and task vector methods by improving contextual perception through diverse and contrastive demo retrieval and deep signal anchoring, leading to significant and stable performance gains across AD benchmarks. This new paradigm is particularly effective for fine-grained, out-of-distribution, and low-resource LLM adaptation in specialized domains.</p>

                    <li>LLMs struggle with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection from narrative transcripts because it's an out-of-distribution (OOD) task and standard ICL demos produce highly homogeneous contexts, hindering both 'task cognition' and 'contextual perception'.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The DA4ICL framework enhances in-context learning by employing two key components: Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval (DCR) and Projected Vector Anchoring (PVA). DCR expands 'context width' by retrieving demonstration examples that are diverse yet contrastive, thereby enriching the training context. PVA deepens 'context depth' by projecting fine-grained signals from each demo into vector anchors, which are then injected into the LLM's hidden states at every Transformer layer, enabling a more profound integration of class-discriminative information.</p>

                    <p>DA4ICL consistently achieved large and stable performance improvements over both conventional In-Context Learning (ICL) and Task Vector (TV) approaches across three distinct Alzheimer's disease detection benchmarks. This demonstrates its efficacy in overcoming challenges posed by out-of-distribution tasks, homogeneous contexts, and low-resource scenarios in medical text analysis.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This method has significant potential for clinical impact by providing a more robust and accurate AI-powered tool for early Alzheimer's disease detection. By precisely interpreting narrative speech patterns, it could enable clinicians to identify subtle cognitive changes earlier, leading to prompt diagnosis, earlier treatment initiation, and improved patient prognosis and quality of life. It also offers a scalable and less resource-intensive diagnostic adjunct.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from narrative transcripts challenges
large language models (LLMs): pre-training rarely covers this
out-of-distribution task, and all transcript demos describe the same scene,
producing highly homogeneous contexts. These factors cripple both the model's
built-in task knowledge (\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface
subtle, class-discriminative cues (\textbf{contextual perception}). Because
cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for
AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo)
sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack
diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context
depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task
adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are
ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity,
strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce
\textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands
context width via \emph{\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and
deepens each demo's signal via \emph{\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA)
at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large,
stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for
fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.</p>
