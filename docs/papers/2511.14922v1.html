                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Causal-GCN framework utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) applied to structural connectome representations derived from MRI data. It integrates `do-calculus`-based `back-door adjustment` to control for confounders such as age, sex, and APOE4 genotype, which are first summarized using PCA. The model is trained to simulate interventions on individual brain regions by manipulating their incoming edges and node features, enabling the estimation of Average Causal Effects on the probability of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Causal-GCN achieved classification performance comparable to baseline GNNs on 484 subjects from the ADNI cohort. A primary finding is its ability to provide interpretable causal effect rankings, which identified posterior, cingulate, and insular hubs as brain regions exerting significant causal influence on AD progression. These identified regions are consistent with established Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to identify brain regions causally influencing AD progression, rather than merely correlating with it, could lead to more robust and explainable biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. This causal understanding may guide the development of more targeted therapeutic interventions or personalized medicine strategies, focusing on the most influential brain regions to potentially slow or alter disease course.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract notes that Causal-GCN achieves "performance comparable to baseline GNNs," suggesting its primary advantage lies in interpretability and causal insights rather than a significant improvement in raw classification accuracy. The study was conducted on a specific cohort (ADNI) and MRI modality (structural connectome), which may limit the generalizability of the findings without further validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep graph learning has advanced Alzheimer's (AD) disease classification from MRI, but most models remain correlational, confounding demographic and genetic factors with disease specific features. We present Causal-GCN, an interventional graph convolutional framework that integrates do-calculus-based back-door adjustment to identify brain regions exerting stable causal influence on AD progression. Each subject's MRI is represented as a structural connectome where nodes denote cortical and subcortical regions and edges encode anatomical connectivity. Confounders such as age, sec, and APOE4 genotype are summarized via principal components and included in the causal adjustment set. After training, interventions on individual regions are simulated by serving their incoming edges and altering node features to estimate average causal effects on disease probability. Applied to 484 subjects from the ADNI cohort, Causal-GCN achieves performance comparable to baseline GNNs while providing interpretable causal effect rankings that highlight posterior, cingulate, and insular hubs consistent with established AD neuropathology.</p>
