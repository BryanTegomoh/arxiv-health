                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid detection and
treatment to prevent progression to severe sepsis, septic shock, or multi-organ
failure. Despite advances in medical technology, it remains a major challenge
for clinicians. While recent machine learning models have shown promise in
predicting sepsis onset, their black-box nature limits interpretability and
clinical trust. In this study, we present an interpretable AI approach for
sepsis analysis that integrates machine learning with clinical knowledge. Our
method not only delivers accurate predictions of sepsis onset but also enables
clinicians to understand, validate, and align model outputs with established
medical expertise.</p>
