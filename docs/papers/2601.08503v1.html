                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN) is a novel multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model that effectively integrates irregular time series data and unstructured clinical narratives for risk prediction. Applied to a retrospective cohort of 3382 post-kidney transplant patients, TFN achieved superior performance in predicting graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality compared to state-of-the-art models and unimodal baselines. The model's robust performance, enhanced by clinical text integration, along with its interpretable latent factors, underscores its potential for advanced clinical decision support.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a deep learning-based embedding model capable of integrating two distinct data modalities: irregular time series (e.g., laboratory results, vital signs) and unstructured clinical narratives (e.g., physician notes). This multi-modal integration creates task-agnostic embeddings. TFN was retrospectively applied to a cohort of 3382 post-kidney transplant patients to predict graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Performance was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and compared against state-of-the-art models and various unimodal baselines. Model interpretability was evaluated using disentanglement metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>TFN significantly outperformed state-of-the-art models in predicting graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). For mortality prediction, TFN achieved an AUC of 0.86. The model demonstrated approximately 10% AUC improvement over time series-only baselines and 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data. The integration of clinical text was crucial, consistently enhancing performance across all predictive tasks. Furthermore, the model's latent factors were found to be robust and interpretable, with SHAP attributions confirming alignment with established clinical reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The Temporal Fusion Nexus model has the potential to profoundly impact post-kidney transplant care by enabling clinicians to more accurately predict critical outcomes such as graft loss, rejection, and mortality. This improved predictive capability facilitates earlier identification of high-risk patients, allowing for proactive clinical interventions, personalized treatment adjustments, and potentially preventing severe complications. Its task-agnostic and interpretable nature also suggests broad applicability in other complex medical domains requiring the synthesis of diverse, longitudinal patient data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We introduce Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model to integrate irregular time series and unstructured clinical narratives. We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.</p>
