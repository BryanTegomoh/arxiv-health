                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper systematically disentangles the contributions of generic architectural trends (e.g., Transformers) versus domain-specific designs (e.g., motion pyramids) in deep learning-based medical image registration. It demonstrates that high-level, registration-specific strategies consistently yield more accurate, smoother, and robust deformations, providing significantly greater performance gains over a baseline U-Net than generic trend-driven blocks. The research advocates for a shift in focus towards refining domain-specific principles for driving progress in this field.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a modular framework designed to systematically isolate and evaluate the impact of two distinct deep learning paradigms: low-level 'trend-driven' computational blocks (e.g., large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, state-space models) and high-level 'registration-specific' designs (e.g., motion pyramids, correlation layers, iterative refinement). This framework was applied to a standard U-Net baseline and tested across multiple medical image registration tasks, including those for brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal organs. All models and experiments were made public via a transparent, modular benchmark platform.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical guidance for the development of next-generation deep learning models for medical image registration. By focusing development efforts on domain-specific design principles rather than merely importing generic architectural trends, clinicians can expect more accurate and reliable registration tools. This will directly improve quantitative analysis for tasks such as surgical planning, tumor tracking, cardiac motion analysis, and organ deformation assessment, ultimately leading to more precise diagnoses, personalized treatment strategies, and better patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating "trend-driven" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\sim3\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.</p>
