                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and validated a novel contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging method using a cationic contrast agent (CA4+) with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to quantify proteoglycan content in articular cartilage. It successfully demonstrated significant correlations between the enhanced radiopacity, directly linked to proteoglycan content, and the viscoelastic mechanical properties of healthy bovine articular cartilage. This approach shows promise for early and precise detection of cartilage degeneration.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Articular cartilage showcases distinctive mechanical behaviour, attributable
to its biphasic composition and hierarchical organization. Proteoglycans,
essential constituents of the extracellular matrix, contribute to tissue
swelling, stiffness, and viscoelasticity, thanks to the fixed charge density.
Degenerative alterations in proteoglycan content and collagen structure - key
indicators of diseases such as osteoarthritis - compromise the mechanical
integrity of articular cartilage, underscoring the importance of early
detection. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable compositional
information, its limited spatial resolution restricts its effectiveness in
evaluating thin soft tissues such as articular cartilage. As an alternative,
contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging circumvents such limitation, resorting to the
use of radiopaque contrast agents. In this context, cationic contrast agents,
like CA4+, enable the quantitative assessment of proteoglycan content via
electrostatic attraction. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
tomography offers an optimal compromise between spatial resolution and
radiation exposure, making it a promising tool for clinical use. This study
aimed to explore the relationship between proteoglycan content - quantified
through contrast-enhanced high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
tomography combined with the use of CA4+ - and the viscoelastic properties of
healthy bovine articular cartilage, assessed via indentation testing. Results
highlighted significant correlations between the enhanced radiopacity of
articular cartilage, ascribable to the PG content, with parameters representing
the mechanical response of the tissue.</p>
