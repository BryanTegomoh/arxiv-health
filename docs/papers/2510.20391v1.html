                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigated a novel approach for evaluating articular cartilage health by correlating proteoglycan content with mechanical properties. Using a cationic contrast agent (CA4+) with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), the researchers successfully quantified proteoglycan content in healthy bovine articular cartilage and found significant correlations between the enhanced radiopacity and the tissue's viscoelastic mechanical response, suggesting its potential for early detection of cartilage degeneration.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for developing non-invasive diagnostic tools capable of detecting early-stage articular cartilage degeneration, particularly in conditions like osteoarthritis. Early and quantitative assessment of proteoglycan loss and its impact on mechanical properties can enable timely interventions, potentially slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Articular cartilage showcases distinctive mechanical behaviour, attributable
to its biphasic composition and hierarchical organization. Proteoglycans,
essential constituents of the extracellular matrix, contribute to tissue
swelling, stiffness, and viscoelasticity, thanks to the fixed charge density.
Degenerative alterations in proteoglycan content and collagen structure - key
indicators of diseases such as osteoarthritis - compromise the mechanical
integrity of articular cartilage, underscoring the importance of early
detection. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable compositional
information, its limited spatial resolution restricts its effectiveness in
evaluating thin soft tissues such as articular cartilage. As an alternative,
contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging circumvents such limitation, resorting to the
use of radiopaque contrast agents. In this context, cationic contrast agents,
like CA4+, enable the quantitative assessment of proteoglycan content via
electrostatic attraction. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
tomography offers an optimal compromise between spatial resolution and
radiation exposure, making it a promising tool for clinical use. This study
aimed to explore the relationship between proteoglycan content - quantified
through contrast-enhanced high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
tomography combined with the use of CA4+ - and the viscoelastic properties of
healthy bovine articular cartilage, assessed via indentation testing. Results
highlighted significant correlations between the enhanced radiopacity of
articular cartilage, ascribable to the PG content, with parameters representing
the mechanical response of the tissue.</p>
