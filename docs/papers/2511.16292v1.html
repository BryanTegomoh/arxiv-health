                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using distributed multi-agent systems and natural-language communication to enable secure and privacy-preserving cooperation between independent healthcare organizations. This could facilitate automated and intelligent workflows for patient referrals, insurance pre-authorizations, specialist consultations, and information sharing, without centralizing sensitive patient data or compromising identity.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a proof-of-concept prototype based on the Orpius platform for multi-agent orchestration. It simulated three independent organizational agents (Clinic, Insurer, Specialist Network), each managing its own local synthetic data. Communication occurred through natural-language `OperationRelay` calls, and patient identity was pseudonymised using an HMAC-based token generated by the Clinic. The system's functionality was evaluated through basic functional runs to demonstrate secure, distributed reasoning and data exchange without centralized infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is the successful demonstration of feasibility for secure, distributed agent reasoning across independent systems with strict data locality. The prototype proved that organizations can cooperate to exchange necessary information (e.g., insurance coverage, specialist recommendations) using natural language and pseudonymous tokens, without sharing raw patient identifiers or requiring a centralized data exchange, thereby preserving patient privacy effectively.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This approach has the potential to significantly enhance secure data exchange and collaboration in healthcare, enabling more efficient and privacy-compliant workflows for referrals, insurance authorizations, and coordinated care. It could reduce current barriers to data sharing among disparate healthcare providers and payers, leading to improved patient outcomes through better-informed clinical decisions and streamlined administrative processes while adhering to stringent privacy regulations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.</p>
