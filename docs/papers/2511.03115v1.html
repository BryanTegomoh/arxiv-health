                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to proton therapy as it introduces a method to drastically speed up dose calculations without compromising accuracy. Faster calculations enable more efficient treatment planning, adaptive radiotherapy, and potentially real-time dose monitoring, which can lead to improved patient care and outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The described SDE-based Monte Carlo method is a computational physics model, not inherently an AI application in the machine learning sense. However, advanced computational methods like this are foundational for modern, data-driven, and potentially AI-accelerated treatment planning systems in health. Speeding up dose calculations can enable more complex optimization algorithms, adaptive therapy planning, or real-time decision support systems that might incorporate AI components in the future.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objective: To validate a newly proposed stochastic differential equation
(SDE)-based model for proton beam energy deposition by comparing its
predictions with those from Geant4 in simplified phantom scenarios. Approach:
Building on previous work in Crossley et al. (2025), where energy deposition
from a proton beam was modelled using an SDE framework, we implemented the
model with standard approximations to interaction cross sections and mean
excitation energies, which makes simulations easily adaptable to new materials
and configurations. The model was benchmarked against Geant4 in homogeneous and
heterogeneous phantoms. Main results: The SDE-based dose distributions agreed
well with Geant4, showing range differences within 0.4 mm and 3D gamma pass
rates exceeding 98% under 3%/2 mm criteria with a 1% dose threshold. The model
achieved a computational speed-up of approximately fivefold relative to Geant4,
consistent across different Geant4 physics lists. Significance: These results
demonstrate that the SDE approach can reproduce accuracy comparable to
high-fidelity Monte Carlo for proton therapy at a fraction of the computational
cost, highlighting its potential for accelerating dose calculations and
treatment planning.</p>
