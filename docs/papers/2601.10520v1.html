                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GRACE (Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt), a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture designed to ensure safe and ethical AI alignment by decoupling normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making. GRACE facilitates interpretability, contestability, and justifiability of AI actions through a Moral Module, a Decision-Making Module, and a Guard. The architecture offers formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment, demonstrated using an LLM therapy assistant as an example.</p>

                    <p>The authors propose a novel neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture called GRACE. This architecture conceptually separates normative reasoning (via a Moral Module using deontic logic and a reason-based formalism) from instrumental decision-making (via a Decision-Making Module encapsulating the target agent). A Guard module is designed to monitor and enforce compliance. The methodology includes demonstrating the architectural principles and benefits using an example of an LLM therapy assistant.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.</p>
