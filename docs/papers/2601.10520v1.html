                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GRACE (Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt), a neuro-symbolic, reason-based containment architecture designed to ensure AI agents' decisions are normatively aligned and not just instrumentally effective. GRACE decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making through a three-module system comprising a Moral Module, a Decision-Making Module, and a Guard, enabling interpretability, contestability, and verifiable moral compliance for AI agents of diverse designs. It demonstrates its efficacy using an LLM therapy assistant, showing how stakeholders can understand and refine agent behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.</p>
