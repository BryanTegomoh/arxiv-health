                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper introduces GRACE, a neuro-symbolic architecture with three distinct modules: a Moral Module (MM) that uses a reason-based formalism providing semantic foundations for deontic logic to determine permissible macro actions; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target AI agent and selects instrumentally optimal primitive actions within the macro action constraints; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance via formal verification and statistical guarantees. This structure allows normative reasoning to guide and constrain the instrumental decisions of the target AI.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the successful conceptualization and demonstration of GRACE, which effectively decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making. Through its application to an LLM therapy assistant, the authors demonstrated that GRACE enables stakeholders to understand the ethical basis of AI decisions, contest them where necessary, and refine the agent's behavior to ensure alignment with ethical norms and safety standards.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>GRACE has significant potential to enhance the safety, trustworthiness, and ethical integration of AI in clinical settings. By providing interpretable, justifiable, and contestable AI decisions, it can foster greater acceptance among healthcare professionals and patients. For LLM therapy assistants, it could ensure that interventions are always within ethical boundaries, preventing harm, upholding patient autonomy, and facilitating responsible deployment in mental health care. It also offers a pathway for regulatory bodies to assess and certify AI systems for clinical use.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.</p>
