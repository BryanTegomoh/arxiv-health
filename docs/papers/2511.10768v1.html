                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel cross-lingual framework combining TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition (NER) with large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful summaries of consumer health questions (CHQs). The approach specifically fine-tunes LLaMA-2-7B on English (MeQSum) and Bangla (BanglaCHQ-Summ) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality and faithfulness metrics. This framework significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and prior systems, demonstrating enhanced reliability for LLM deployment in healthcare by ensuring critical medical information is preserved.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.</p>
