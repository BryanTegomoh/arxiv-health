                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated a novel non-coplanar beam orientation optimization algorithm for high-dose reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The approach demonstrated the ability to reduce maximum cumulative equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) by at least 5 Gy2 in a significant subset of challenging cases, while maintaining comparable target coverage to standard coplanar techniques.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reirradiation of NSCLC is challenging due to the cumulative dose limits of previously irradiated organs. This research offers a computational method to potentially make reirradiation safer and more effective by strategically avoiding critical structures, thereby expanding treatment options for patients with recurrent lung cancer.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes an 'EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm' for the 'simultaneous optimization' of dynamic gantry-couch paths and cumulative EQD2 distribution in radiation therapy. This 'automated selection of favorable non-coplanar beam orientations' is an application of computational optimization methods to medical treatment planning. While not explicitly termed 'AI,' such optimization algorithms in complex medical domains are foundational for or often incorporate AI/machine learning techniques to enhance precision, personalization, and efficiency in medical procedures and fall squarely within the scope of AI applications in healthcare for treatment planning and delivery.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized an in-silico design, analyzing 15 cases of locoregionally recurrent NSCLC. For each patient, the prior dose distribution was rigidly registered to the reirradiation planning CT and converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). A custom 2-arc non-coplanar reirradiation plan was generated using an EQD2-based direct aperture optimization (DAO) algorithm that simultaneously optimizes the dynamic gantry-couch path and the cumulative EQD2 distribution. These plans were then quantitatively compared against 2-arc coplanar VMAT plans, serving as the benchmark for current clinical practice.</p>

                    <p>Non-coplanar reirradiation plans successfully reduced the maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical OARs, including the bronchial tree, esophagus, thoracic wall, and trachea, by at least 5 Gy2 in 6 of the 15 patients studied. Critically, these improvements in OAR sparing were achieved without compromising target coverage or increasing lung EQD2 metrics when compared to standard coplanar VMAT plans.</p>

                <p>This automated non-coplanar planning approach has the potential to significantly improve the therapeutic window for high-dose reirradiation of recurrent NSCLC. By reducing cumulative doses to critical OARs, it could either lead to safer re-treatment with lower risks of severe toxicities or enable dose escalation to the tumor, potentially improving local control rates without increasing complications. This could be particularly beneficial for challenging cases where conventional coplanar techniques are limited.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: Reirradiation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
is commonly delivered using coplanar techniques. In this study, we developed a
beam orientation optimization algorithm for reirradiation planning to
investigate whether the selection of favorable non-coplanar beam orientations
may limit cumulative doses to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) and thus improve
the therapeutic window.
  Materials and Methods: Fifteen cases of challenging high-dose reirradiation
for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC were included in this in-silico study. For
each patient, the dose distribution from the previous treatment was first
mapped to the reirradiation planning CT using rigid dose registration, and
subsequently converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). A 2-arc
non-coplanar reirradiation plan, combining dynamic gantry and couch rotation,
was then generated using an EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm,
which allows for the simultaneous optimization of the dynamic gantry-couch path
and the cumulative EQD2 distribution. Non-coplanar reirradiation plans were
benchmarked against 2-arc coplanar VMAT plans, which mimic state-of-the-art
practice for reirradiation of NSCLC.
  Results: Non-coplanar reirradiation plans could reduce the maximum cumulative
EQD2 to critical OARs such as bronchial tree, esophagus, thoracic wall and
trachea by at least 5 Gy2 for 6 out of 15 patients compared to coplanar
reirradiation plans. At the same time, target coverage and lung EQD2 metrics
were comparable for both methods.
  Conclusions: The automated selection of favorable non-coplanar beam
orientations may reduce the maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical OARs in
challenging thoracic reirradiation cases. This allows to explore either better
OAR sparing or dose-escalation in future clinical studies.</p>
