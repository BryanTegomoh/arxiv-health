                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated a novel algorithm for simultaneous optimization of non-coplanar beam orientations and cumulative EQD2 distribution for high-dose reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It demonstrated that non-coplanar plans can significantly reduce maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) compared to conventional coplanar techniques, while maintaining target coverage. This advancement aims to improve the therapeutic window for challenging reirradiation cases.</p>

                    <p>This was an in-silico study involving 15 cases of locoregionally recurrent NSCLC undergoing high-dose reirradiation. Previous treatment dose distributions were mapped to the reirradiation planning CT using rigid dose registration and subsequently converted to cumulative EQD2.

                <p>This automated non-coplanar beam orientation optimization offers a promising strategy to significantly improve the therapeutic window for high-dose reirradiation of recurrent NSCLC. By effectively limiting cumulative doses to critical OARs, it has the potential to reduce treatment-related toxicities, thereby enhancing patient safety and quality of life. Furthermore, this enhanced OAR sparing could enable clinicians to explore dose escalation to the tumor, potentially improving local control outcomes without increasing toxicity.</p>

                <p>Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but as an in-silico (computational) study, clinical validation in prospective trials is essential. The reliance on rigid dose registration for previous treatment doses might not fully account for anatomical changes or organ motion between treatment courses.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: Reirradiation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
is commonly delivered using coplanar techniques. In this study, we developed a
beam orientation optimization algorithm for reirradiation planning to
investigate whether the selection of favorable non-coplanar beam orientations
may limit cumulative doses to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) and thus improve
the therapeutic window.
  Materials and Methods: Fifteen cases of challenging high-dose reirradiation
for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC were included in this in-silico study. For
each patient, the dose distribution from the previous treatment was first
mapped to the reirradiation planning CT using rigid dose registration, and
subsequently converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). A 2-arc
non-coplanar reirradiation plan, combining dynamic gantry and couch rotation,
was then generated using an EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm,
which allows for the simultaneous optimization of the dynamic gantry-couch path
and the cumulative EQD2 distribution. Non-coplanar reirradiation plans were
benchmarked against 2-arc coplanar VMAT plans, which mimic state-of-the-art
practice for reirradiation of NSCLC.
  Results: Non-coplanar reirradiation plans could reduce the maximum cumulative
EQD2 to critical OARs such as bronchial tree, esophagus, thoracic wall and
trachea by at least 5 Gy2 for 6 out of 15 patients compared to coplanar
reirradiation plans. At the same time, target coverage and lung EQD2 metrics
were comparable for both methods.
  Conclusions: The automated selection of favorable non-coplanar beam
orientations may reduce the maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical OARs in
challenging thoracic reirradiation cases. This allows to explore either better
OAR sparing or dose-escalation in future clinical studies.</p>
