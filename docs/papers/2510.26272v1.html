                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm for non-coplanar beam orientation in high-dose reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It showed that non-coplanar planning could reduce maximum cumulative equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) like the bronchial tree, esophagus, thoracic wall, and trachea by at least 5 Gy2 in challenging cases. This was achieved without compromising target coverage or lung EQD2, suggesting an improved therapeutic window for these complex treatments.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reirradiation of recurrent NSCLC is often limited by the cumulative dose tolerance of critical OARs. This optimized non-coplanar approach offers a method to enhance OAR sparing, potentially allowing for safer delivery of high reirradiation doses or dose escalation, thereby improving treatment outcomes for patients with limited options.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes an 'EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm' for radiation therapy planning. This algorithm simultaneously optimizes the dynamic gantry-couch path and the cumulative equivalent dose distribution to achieve more favorable non-coplanar beam orientations. This is an application of computational optimization and AI techniques to automatically select and plan medical treatments (reirradiation for lung cancer) with the goal of improving patient safety by sparing organs-at-risk while maintaining target coverage.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: Reirradiation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
is commonly delivered using coplanar techniques. In this study, we developed a
beam orientation optimization algorithm for reirradiation planning to
investigate whether the selection of favorable non-coplanar beam orientations
may limit cumulative doses to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) and thus improve
the therapeutic window.
  Materials and Methods: Fifteen cases of challenging high-dose reirradiation
for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC were included in this in-silico study. For
each patient, the dose distribution from the previous treatment was first
mapped to the reirradiation planning CT using rigid dose registration, and
subsequently converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). A 2-arc
non-coplanar reirradiation plan, combining dynamic gantry and couch rotation,
was then generated using an EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm,
which allows for the simultaneous optimization of the dynamic gantry-couch path
and the cumulative EQD2 distribution. Non-coplanar reirradiation plans were
benchmarked against 2-arc coplanar VMAT plans, which mimic state-of-the-art
practice for reirradiation of NSCLC.
  Results: Non-coplanar reirradiation plans could reduce the maximum cumulative
EQD2 to critical OARs such as bronchial tree, esophagus, thoracic wall and
trachea by at least 5 Gy2 for 6 out of 15 patients compared to coplanar
reirradiation plans. At the same time, target coverage and lung EQD2 metrics
were comparable for both methods.
  Conclusions: The automated selection of favorable non-coplanar beam
orientations may reduce the maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical OARs in
challenging thoracic reirradiation cases. This allows to explore either better
OAR sparing or dose-escalation in future clinical studies.</p>
