                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for the unsupervised detection of both focal lesions and non-lesional post-stroke brain abnormalities like atrophy and ventricular enlargement. The study demonstrates that training the model on healthy control data significantly outperforms training on lesion-free stroke patient data, achieving improved segmentation of lesions and higher sensitivity to secondary structural changes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate and comprehensive detection of post-stroke brain abnormalities, including both focal lesions and secondary structural changes like atrophy, is crucial as these are increasingly recognized as imaging biomarkers for recovery trajectories and long-term patient outcomes. This method offers a more reliable way to identify these critical indicators.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the unsupervised detection and segmentation of various post-stroke brain abnormalities (focal lesions, atrophy, ventricular enlargement) from MRI scans. This can assist clinicians in more reliably identifying these changes, which are recognized as biomarkers for patient recovery and outcome, thereby improving diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring in stroke patients.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised anomaly detection. Model performance was evaluated on the ATLAS dataset, using dual-expert central-slice annotations. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was employed to assess anomaly maps.

                    <p>On ATLAS test subjects, the model trained on healthy controls (IXI) significantly outperformed the model trained on lesion-free stroke patient data (ATLAS). The IXI-trained model achieved a higher Dice score of 0.37 for lesion segmentation (vs 0.27) and improved sensitivity for non-lesional abnormalities with an FROC score of 0.62 (vs 0.43). This indicates that training on fully healthy anatomy leads to better modeling of normal variability, enabling more comprehensive and reliable detection of all structural abnormalities.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This unsupervised detection method could significantly enhance the clinical assessment of post-stroke patients by providing a more complete picture of brain changes beyond focal lesions. It could aid in more precise prognostication, monitor the progression of secondary changes like atrophy, and potentially guide more targeted rehabilitation strategies, ultimately improving patient management and outcome prediction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.</p>
