                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper evaluates REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both focal lesions and secondary non-lesional structural brain abnormalities post-stroke. The study demonstrates that training the model on fully healthy anatomy significantly improves its ability to segment lesions (Dice = 0.37) and detect non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62) compared to training on lesion-free stroke slices. This approach aims to better capture crucial imaging biomarkers for post-stroke recovery and outcome.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, trained on MRI data. Two distinct training strategies were employed: one model trained on lesion-free slices from post-stroke patients (ATLAS dataset) and another on healthy control subjects (IXI dataset). Evaluation was performed on ATLAS test subjects, using dual-expert central-slice annotations. Performance metrics included Dice coefficient for focal lesion segmentation and Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis for the detection of both focal and non-lesional abnormalities from generated anomaly maps.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The model trained on healthy control data (IXI-trained) significantly outperformed the model trained on lesion-free stroke data. Specifically, the IXI-trained model achieved a higher Dice score for lesion segmentation (0.37 compared to 0.27) and improved sensitivity for detecting non-lesional abnormalities, as indicated by a higher FROC score (0.62 compared to 0.43). This demonstrates that training on healthy anatomy is superior for capturing normal brain variability, leading to broader and more reliable detection of diverse post-stroke structural changes.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This unsupervised method has the potential to provide a more comprehensive and automated assessment of post-stroke brain changes beyond just focal lesions, including subtle atrophic and ventricular abnormalities. This could lead to more precise prognostication, personalized rehabilitation strategies, and the development of new imaging biomarkers for recovery, ultimately improving patient management and treatment efficacy by offering a richer picture of brain pathology.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, typical limitations for such a study might include reliance on specific datasets (ATLAS, IXI) which may affect generalizability, the use of central-slice annotations rather than full 3D volumes, and the need for further validation in larger, more diverse patient cohorts across different stroke types and severities.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly mention future research directions. However, logical next steps would include validating the REFLECT model on full 3D brain volumes, exploring its application in longitudinal studies to track changes over time, integrating these detected abnormalities with clinical outcomes, and evaluating its robustness across different MRI scanners and acquisition protocols to ensure broader clinical applicability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.</p>
