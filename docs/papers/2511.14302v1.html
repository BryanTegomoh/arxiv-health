                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SAM-Fed is a federated semi-supervised learning framework that combines several advanced techniques. It utilizes a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to provide strong supervision. This guidance is implemented via dual knowledge distillation (DKD), transferring knowledge to lightweight client models. An adaptive agreement mechanism is used to refine pixel-level pseudo-labels generated during the semi-supervised process, ensuring their reliability. The framework operates in a federated manner, allowing clients to train on local data while benefiting from global knowledge and foundation model guidance without data centralization.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.</p>
