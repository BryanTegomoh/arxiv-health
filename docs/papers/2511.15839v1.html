                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper comparatively analyzes Bayesian and Frequentist inference frameworks across various biological models, including epidemiological ones, to assess their accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and identifiability. It concludes that Frequentist methods are superior for rich, fully observed data, while Bayesian methods excel with sparse data and high latent-state uncertainty, offering crucial guidance for model selection in health research.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This study is highly relevant to medical and public health, as it provides critical empirical evidence for choosing optimal statistical inference frameworks essential for robust disease modeling, accurate epidemic forecasting, and understanding complex physiological processes, directly impacting public health policy and clinical decision-making.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides foundational methodological insights for quantitative modeling in health. While not directly an AI application in the sense of deep learning, the comparative analysis of inference frameworks (Bayesian and Frequentist) is essential for developing robust predictive models in healthcare. These models, particularly for disease forecasting (mpox, COVID-19), can be integrated into AI-driven decision support systems, early warning systems for public health, and resource allocation tools in healthcare. Bayesian methods, in particular, are a cornerstone of probabilistic AI. Therefore, this work underpins the statistical rigor required for many medical AI/data science applications aimed at forecasting disease progression and informing interventions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study performed a comparative analysis of Bayesian and Frequentist inference methods across three ordinary differential equation (ODE) based biological models: Lotka-Volterra, a generalized logistic model (applied to lung injury and mpox), and an SEIUR epidemic model (for COVID-19). Four datasets were used, and a normal error structure was assumed for both frameworks. Evaluation included structural and practical identifiability, and forecasting performance using MAE, MSE, 95% PI coverage, and WIS. The Frequentist workflow utilized QuantDiffForecast (QDF) in MATLAB for nonlinear least squares fitting and parametric bootstrap for uncertainty. The Bayesian workflow employed BayesianFitForecast (BFF) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and assess convergence with R-hat statistics.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The main findings indicate that Frequentist inference outperforms Bayesian inference when data are rich and fully observed. Conversely, Bayesian inference demonstrates superior performance in scenarios characterized by sparse data and high latent-state uncertainty, as critically observed in the SEIUR COVID-19 epidemic model. Structural identifiability analyses confirmed that full data observability benefits both approaches, whereas limited observability severely restricts the ability to reliably recover model parameters, thereby justifying the observed performance differences.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has significant clinical and public health impact by providing a clear framework for selecting the most appropriate statistical modeling approach in disease forecasting and epidemiological studies. By aligning the inference method with data characteristics (richness, observability, uncertainty), clinicians and public health officials can achieve more accurate predictions of disease spread (e.g., COVID-19, mpox), better quantify the uncertainty in those predictions, and thus make more informed, evidence-based decisions regarding resource allocation, intervention strategies, and patient management, particularly in data-scarce or uncertain environments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mathematical models support inference and forecasting in ecology and epidemiology, but results depend on the estimation framework. We compare Bayesian and Frequentist approaches across three biological models using four datasets: Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics (Hudson Bay), a generalized logistic model (lung injury and 2022 U.S. mpox), and an SEIUR epidemic model (COVID-19 in Spain). Both approaches use a normal error structure to ensure a fair comparison.
  We first assessed structural identifiability to determine which parameters can theoretically be recovered from the data. We then evaluated practical identifiability and forecasting performance using four metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 95 percent prediction interval (PI) coverage, and weighted interval score (WIS). For the Lotka-Volterra model with both prey and predator data, we analyzed three scenarios: prey only, predator only, and both.
  The Frequentist workflow used QuantDiffForecast (QDF) in MATLAB, which fits ODE models via nonlinear least squares and quantifies uncertainty through parametric bootstrap. The Bayesian workflow used BayesianFitForecast (BFF), which employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic.
  Results show that Frequentist inference performs best when data are rich and fully observed, while Bayesian inference excels when latent-state uncertainty is high and data are sparse, as in the SEIUR COVID-19 model. Structural identifiability clarifies these patterns: full observability benefits both frameworks, while limited observability constrains parameter recovery. This comparison provides guidance for choosing inference frameworks based on data richness, observability, and uncertainty needs.</p>
