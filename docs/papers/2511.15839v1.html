                    <p>The study employed a comparative analysis of Bayesian and Frequentist inference frameworks on three biological models (Lotka-Volterra, generalized logistic, SEIUR epidemic) using four datasets, assuming a normal error structure for a fair comparison.

The Bayesian approach utilized BayesianFitForecast (BFF) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and diagnose convergence.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Frequentist inference consistently performs best when datasets are rich and fully observed. Conversely, Bayesian inference demonstrates superior performance, particularly in terms of handling uncertainty, when data are sparse and characterized by high latent-state uncertainty, as exemplified by the SEIUR COVID-19 model. The study also highlighted the foundational role of structural identifiability, showing that while full data observability benefits both frameworks, limited observability fundamentally restricts parameter recovery regardless of the inference method.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical, data-driven guidance for epidemiologists, public health officials, and clinical researchers in selecting the most appropriate inference framework (Bayesian or Frequentist) for modeling health outcomes and disease dynamics. By understanding when each method excels based on data richness, observability, and uncertainty levels, practitioners can generate more accurate forecasts, quantify uncertainty more reliably, and ultimately make better-informed decisions for public health interventions, resource allocation, and patient management.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The comparative analysis used a normal error structure, which may limit generalizability to models requiring different error distributions. The conclusions are drawn from a specific set of biological models and datasets, suggesting that their applicability to all medical modeling scenarios might require further validation. The study implicitly highlights that Frequentist methods may be less reliable with sparse data and high latent-state uncertainty, while Bayesian methods might be less efficient or necessary with abundant, fully observed data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mathematical models support inference and forecasting in ecology and epidemiology, but results depend on the estimation framework. We compare Bayesian and Frequentist approaches across three biological models using four datasets: Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics (Hudson Bay), a generalized logistic model (lung injury and 2022 U.S. mpox), and an SEIUR epidemic model (COVID-19 in Spain). Both approaches use a normal error structure to ensure a fair comparison.
  We first assessed structural identifiability to determine which parameters can theoretically be recovered from the data. We then evaluated practical identifiability and forecasting performance using four metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 95 percent prediction interval (PI) coverage, and weighted interval score (WIS). For the Lotka-Volterra model with both prey and predator data, we analyzed three scenarios: prey only, predator only, and both.
  The Frequentist workflow used QuantDiffForecast (QDF) in MATLAB, which fits ODE models via nonlinear least squares and quantifies uncertainty through parametric bootstrap. The Bayesian workflow used BayesianFitForecast (BFF), which employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic.
  Results show that Frequentist inference performs best when data are rich and fully observed, while Bayesian inference excels when latent-state uncertainty is high and data are sparse, as in the SEIUR COVID-19 model. Structural identifiability clarifies these patterns: full observability benefits both frameworks, while limited observability constrains parameter recovery. This comparison provides guidance for choosing inference frameworks based on data richness, observability, and uncertainty needs.</p>
