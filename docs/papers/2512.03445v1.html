                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed VLP framework consists of two main components: 1) A Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system that uses a foundation model for captioning and a retrieval-based verification process to synthesize high-quality, knowledge-enriched image descriptions. 2) An Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining module which decomposes long medical texts into distinct knowledge aspects. This module facilitates fine-grained vision-text alignment at global and patch levels and explicitly integrates medical concept relationships using an ontology. The framework was validated using zero-shot performance metrics on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets. Our code and the augmented dataset Derm1M-AgentAug, comprising over 400k skin-image-text pairs, will be released at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/Derm1M.</p>
