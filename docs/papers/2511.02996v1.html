                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">SCALE-VLP introduces a novel soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework specifically designed for volumetric medical data, like CT scans. By integrating volumetric spatial semantics and domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics, it overcomes limitations of 2D-focused VLMs that often ignore crucial spatial coherence and structured dependencies. The framework demonstrates significant improvements across various tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in CT-report retrieval, abnormality classification, and report generation, while showcasing strong cross-task and zero-shot cross-domain generalizability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.</p>
