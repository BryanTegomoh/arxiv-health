                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in maternal and newborn healthcare triage when processing Indian languages, specifically comparing native scripts to romanized text. It reveals a consistent and significant degradation in LLM performance (5-12 F1 points lower) for romanized inputs, which could lead to millions of excess triage errors in real-world clinical settings. Crucially, the study finds that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries but fail to reliably act on it in final classification due to orthographic noise.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is critically important for patient safety in digital health initiatives, especially in multilingual regions like India, as it uncovers a significant reliability gap in LLM-based triage systems when patients communicate using common romanized scripts, potentially leading to misdiagnosis or delayed care in maternal and newborn health.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a benchmarking approach, evaluating leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries. This dataset comprised inputs in five Indian languages and Nepali, presented in both native and romanized scripts. The specific task was maternal and newborn healthcare triage. Performance was measured using F1 scores to compare the reliability of LLM classification outputs across the two script types.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is a consistent and significant performance degradation of LLMs when processing romanized messages, with F1 scores 5-12 points lower compared to native scripts. This gap translates to a potential for millions of excess triage errors in a real-world clinical setting. A crucial insight is that while LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries, their final classification outputs remain brittle and unreliable due to orthographic noise.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings highlight a critical safety vulnerability in deploying LLM-based health systems in multilingual, digitally evolving contexts. Inaccurate triage due to romanization could lead to inappropriate or delayed medical advice for pregnant women and newborns, potentially resulting in adverse health outcomes. It necessitates a re-evaluation of current LLM deployment strategies and emphasizes the urgent need for models robust to orthographic variations to ensure equitable and safe healthcare access.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the study itself. However, it implicitly points to a critical limitation of current LLMs: their brittleness in converting correctly inferred semantic intent from noisy romanized inputs into reliable final classification outputs, representing a 'safety blind spot' in their clinical application.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated, the findings strongly imply future research should focus on improving the robustness of LLMs to orthographic noise and romanization. This includes developing techniques for more reliable classification outputs even when semantic intent is correctly inferred from noisy inputs, and potentially pre-processing or fine-tuning strategies tailored for diverse orthographic variations in clinical language processing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.</p>
