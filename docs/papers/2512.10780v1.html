                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the impact of romanized text input on Large Language Model (LLM) performance in maternal and newborn healthcare triage for Indian languages. It reveals a consistent and significant degradation in LLM accuracy (5-12 points F1 score) when processing romanized messages compared to native scripts, leading to a projected 2 million excess errors at a partner organization. The study highlights that this performance gap stems from the brittleness of LLM classification outputs to orthographic noise, even when the models correctly infer the semantic intent of the romanized queries.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research identifies a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems, directly impacting the reliability of clinical triage in high-stakes domains like maternal and newborn healthcare. Failure to address this can lead to millions of preventable errors, posing significant risks to patient safety and care quality, especially in diverse linguistic contexts like India.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated or semi-automated triage of patient queries, particularly in maternal and newborn healthcare settings. This involves processing user-generated text (potentially in diverse languages and scripts) to provide critical health guidance and determine urgency, thereby impacting healthcare access, efficiency, and safety for patients.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved benchmarking leading Large Language Models (LLMs) on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries. This dataset covered five Indian languages and Nepali, presented in both native scripts and romanized forms. The evaluation focused on the task of maternal and newborn healthcare triage, comparing the F1 scores between native script and romanized inputs. Additionally, the methodology involved analyzing whether LLMs correctly inferred semantic intent even when final classification outputs were brittle.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is a consistent and significant degradation in LLM performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing native scripts by 5-12 points. This performance gap is projected to cause nearly 2 million excess triage errors at a partner organization. While LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries, their final classification outputs demonstrate brittleness due to orthographic noise in the romanized inputs, indicating a failure in reliable action rather than understanding.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings highlight a critical safety concern for LLM deployment in clinical settings, particularly in multilingual regions where romanization is common. It implies that current LLM-based triage systems for maternal and newborn health in India may be significantly less reliable for users communicating in romanized scripts, potentially leading to misclassification of urgency, delayed care, or incorrect medical advice. This necessitates a re-evaluation of LLM safety and efficacy for real-world clinical applications and calls for robust solutions to handle orthographic variations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.</p>
