                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces IFFair, a novel pre-processing method designed to mitigate bias in machine learning models by dynamically reweighting training samples. Leveraging influence functions, IFFair adjusts sample weights based on their disparate impact on different unprivileged groups, without altering the model's architecture or decision boundaries. Experiments show that IFFair successfully reduces bias across multiple established fairness metrics while achieving a better trade-off between utility and fairness compared to existing pre-processing techniques.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Machine learning is increasingly deployed in healthcare for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment recommendations; however, biased algorithms can lead to unequal access to care, misdiagnosis, or inappropriate treatment for certain patient populations, exacerbating existing health disparities. IFFair offers a mechanism to develop more equitable AI systems in medicine, ensuring fair and non-discriminatory outcomes for all patients.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a foundational AI method for ensuring fairness in machine learning models. When applied in health, it would make AI-powered diagnostic tools, treatment recommendation systems, patient risk assessments, and healthcare resource allocation algorithms more equitable and less discriminatory. For example, it could prevent an AI from disproportionately misdiagnosing or undertreating certain demographic groups, thereby improving health outcomes and reducing disparities.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>IFFair is a pre-processing method that employs influence functions to quantify the impact of individual training samples on the model's predictions for different protected groups. This influence disparity serves as a guiding signal to dynamically adjust the weights of training samples during the model's training process. By reweighting samples, the method aims to reduce the disproportionate influence of certain data points on group-specific outcomes, thereby mitigating bias without requiring changes to the underlying neural network architecture, data feature representation, or the model's final decision boundaries.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found that IFFair effectively mitigates bias across a spectrum of commonly accepted fairness metrics, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity, and error rate parity. Importantly, it achieves this bias reduction without introducing conflicts between different fairness objectives. Furthermore, IFFair demonstrated a superior trade-off between overall model utility (e.g., accuracy) and the achieved fairness levels when compared against other existing pre-processing methods for bias optimization.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Implementing IFFair in medical AI applications could lead to more trustworthy and ethically sound clinical decision support systems, diagnostic tools, and predictive models. By ensuring fairness across patient demographics, it can help prevent biased care, reduce health disparities, and promote equitable access to medical resources and treatments. This could be crucial in areas like disease risk prediction (e.g., for certain ethnic groups), medical image interpretation, or treatment recommendations, where biased models could otherwise lead to adverse health outcomes for vulnerable populations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Because machine learning has significantly improved efficiency and convenience in the society, it's increasingly used to assist or replace human decision-making. However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods.</p>
