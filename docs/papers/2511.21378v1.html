                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel anomaly detection method designed to robustly handle contaminated training data without relying on fixed contamination ratios. AAR dynamically excludes anomalies using modified z-scores and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds, employing both hard and soft rejection strategies. Experiments demonstrate AAR significantly improves performance by 0.041 AUROC compared to state-of-the-art methods, enhancing reliability for real-world applications in domains like healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as healthcare datasets are frequently contaminated with noise, outliers, or mislabeled instances, making reliable anomaly detection crucial. AAR's ability to robustly learn from and identify anomalies even with contaminated training data is essential for accurate disease diagnosis, effective patient monitoring, and medical fraud detection, areas where traditional methods often degrade due to data impurity.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>AAR can be applied to improve the robustness and accuracy of AI models performing anomaly detection in healthcare. For instance, in medical imaging, it can ensure that AI models trained to distinguish 'normal' scans are not inadvertently contaminated by images containing subtle, undiagnosed anomalies, leading to more precise detection of diseases. Similarly, for patient monitoring, it can help develop more reliable AI systems for identifying unusual physiological events (e.g., arrhythmias, sepsis onset) by filtering out noisy or mislabeled 'normal' baseline data. This enhances the overall trustworthiness and performance of AI in clinical decision support, diagnostics, and preventative care.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>AAR can lead to more reliable and robust AI systems in clinical settings, particularly where training data quality is often imperfect due to inherent noise or human error. This can improve diagnostic accuracy by ensuring anomaly detection models are trained on cleaner, more representative 'normal' data, thus better identifying true medical anomalies (e.g., early disease markers, critical patient changes). It also reduces the need for costly and time-consuming manual data cleaning, accelerating the deployment and integration of AI in various healthcare applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.</p>
