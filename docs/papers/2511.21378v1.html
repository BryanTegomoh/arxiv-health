                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method for robust anomaly detection in the presence of contaminated training data, a common challenge in real-world applications. AAR dynamically identifies and excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds, integrating both hard and soft rejection strategies to balance data preservation and anomaly exclusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.041 AUROC, enhancing robustness and reliability for applications in domains like healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In healthcare, anomaly detection is vital for identifying rare diseases, adverse drug reactions, unusual patient vital signs, or fraudulent claims. AAR's ability to learn robustly from contaminated medical data—where subtle anomalies or noisy labels are common—is crucial for developing reliable diagnostic, monitoring, and administrative tools.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR) method would enhance the robustness and reliability of AI models used in healthcare. For instance, in medical image analysis (e.g., radiology, pathology), AAR could improve the training of anomaly detection models by effectively filtering out 'contaminated' normal training data that might inadvertently contain early-stage pathologies or artifacts. This leads to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring, even when ground truth labeling is imperfect or data distributions are complex and overlapping, a common scenario in clinical practice.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR) method dynamically filters contaminated training data. It first calculates a modified z-score for each data point to identify initial outliers. Subsequently, it employs Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based thresholds to adaptively differentiate between normal and anomalous data distributions. To optimize the exclusion process while minimizing loss of normal data, AAR incorporates both 'hard' rejection (absolute removal of clear anomalies) and 'soft' rejection (down-weighting or careful consideration of ambiguous samples) strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.</p>
