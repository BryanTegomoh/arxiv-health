                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel anomaly detection method designed to overcome the critical challenge of contaminated training data by dynamically excluding anomalies. AAR utilizes a modified z-score and Gaussian Mixture Model-based thresholds, integrating both hard and soft rejection strategies to effectively balance data preservation and anomaly removal. The method significantly enhances robustness and performance, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, making it highly relevant for real-world applications, particularly in healthcare.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR) method dynamically purifies training data by identifying and excluding anomalies without relying on fixed contamination ratios. It employs a modified z-score to quantify data point deviation and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based thresholds, which adaptively adjust to the data distribution, to distinguish between normal and anomalous instances. The method integrates a dual rejection strategy: 'hard rejection' for clear anomalies and 'soft rejection' for ambiguous cases, ensuring a balanced approach to data cleansing that preserves normal data integrity while aggressively removing contamination.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has substantial potential to enhance the reliability and accuracy of AI systems in clinical settings. By enabling robust anomaly detection despite contaminated training data, AAR can lead to more accurate and earlier detection of rare diseases, improved monitoring for adverse drug reactions, and better identification of subtle changes indicative of disease progression. This directly translates to improved patient safety, more efficient healthcare resource allocation, and a reduction in diagnostic errors or delays caused by unreliable AI models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.</p>
