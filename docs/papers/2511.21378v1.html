                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method designed to robustly perform anomaly detection by handling contaminated training data. AAR dynamically identifies and excludes anomalies using modified z-scores and Gaussian Mixture Model-based thresholds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 0.041 AUROC. This approach enhances the reliability of AI models in real-world applications, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is critically important for medical/health AI, as clinical datasets are often noisy, incomplete, or contain mislabeled anomalies (e.g., rare diseases, artifacts in imaging). AAR ensures that AI models trained on such imperfect data can still accurately identify anomalies (e.g., disease onset, unusual patient vital signs), leading to more reliable diagnostic tools and improved patient safety.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a method to improve the robustness and reliability of AI models in healthcare by effectively handling contaminated training data. For medical AI, this means models can be trained on 'normal' data that has been rigorously cleaned of subtle anomalies, leading to more accurate and trustworthy performance in tasks such as disease diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendation, real-time patient monitoring, and identifying potential biosecurity threats by detecting unusual patterns in health data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR) method dynamically excludes anomalies during the training phase. It leverages a modified z-score to quantify the statistical deviation of data points from the dataset's median. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are then employed to learn the underlying distribution of the 'normal' data and establish adaptive thresholds for anomaly rejection. AAR combines 'hard rejection' for clearly anomalous data points with 'soft rejection' for borderline cases, effectively balancing the need to remove contaminants while preserving legitimate normal data.</p>

                    <p>The AAR method significantly improves anomaly detection performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. This improvement was consistently demonstrated across a diverse range of datasets, including two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets. AAR proves to be a scalable and robust solution for handling contaminated training data, particularly effective in noisy environments where distinguishing normal from abnormal data is challenging due to overlapping distributions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>AAR has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by enabling the development and deployment of more accurate and reliable AI systems in healthcare. It can mitigate the risks associated with training AI on real-world medical data, which often contains inherent noise or labeling errors. This translates to improved diagnostic accuracy for diseases, more robust patient monitoring systems that can detect critical events earlier, and trustworthy AI-driven insights that clinicians can rely on for better patient management and treatment decisions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.</p>
