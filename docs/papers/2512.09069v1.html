                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces KD-OCT, a novel knowledge distillation framework designed to compress computationally intensive deep learning models for retinal OCT classification into efficient, deployable models. By distilling a powerful ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student, KD-OCT achieves near-teacher diagnostic performance for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases while significantly reducing model size and inference time. This enables real-time, high-accuracy AMD screening suitable for edge deployment.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a knowledge distillation approach, termed KD-OCT. A powerful ConvNeXtV2-Large model, pre-trained with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, serves as the teacher. A lightweight EfficientNet-B2 model is trained as the student. Distillation occurs in real-time, utilizing a combined loss function that balances soft targets (probabilities) from the teacher with hard labels (ground truth) for supervision. The framework was evaluated using patient-level cross-validation on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-related conditions are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) serving as a cornerstone for early detection and management. However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening. Code is available at https://github.com/erfan-nourbakhsh/KD- OCT.</p>
