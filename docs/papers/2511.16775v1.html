                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more robust and accurate method for quantifying cardiac respiratory motion during STAR, which can lead to more precise motion management strategies. By effectively removing cardiac motion artifacts and isolating true respiratory motion, gCGF could facilitate the reduction of internal target volume (ITV) expansions. This, in turn, may allow for higher dose conformity, minimized radiation exposure to healthy cardiac structures, and potentially improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity for patients undergoing STAR for ventricular tachycardia.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radiotherapy (STAR) treats ventricular tachycardia (VT) but requires internal target volume (ITV) expansions to compensate for cardiorespiratory motion. Current clinical r4DCT imaging methods are limited, and the reconstructed r4DCTs suffer from unmanaged cardiac motion artifacts that affect the quantitative assessment of respiratory motion. A groupwise surface-to-surface deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm, named gCGF, was developed. A novel principal component filtering (PCF) mechanism and a spatial smoothing mechanism were developed and incorporated into gCGF to iteratively register heart contours from an average respiratory-phase CT to ten r4DCT phases while removing random cardiac motion from the cyclic respiratory motion. The performance of the groupwise DIR was quantitatively validated using 8 digital phantoms with simulated cardiac artifacts. An ablation study was conducted to compare gCGF to another comparable state-of-the-art groupwise DIR method. gCGF was applied to r4DCTs of 20 STAR patients to analyze the respiratory motion of the heart. Validation on digital phantoms showed that gCGF achieved a mean target registration error of 0.63+-0.51 mm while successfully achieving phase smoothness and reducing cardiac motion artifacts. Among all STAR patients, the heart's maximum and mean respiratory motion magnitudes ranged from 3.6 to 7.9 mm and 1.0 mm to 2.6 mm. The peak-to-peak motion range was from 6.2 to 14.7 mm. For VT targets, the max and mean motion magnitude ranges were 3.0 to 6.7 mm and 0.8 to 2.9 mm, respectively. The peak-to-peak range was from 4.7 to 11.8 mm. Significant dominance of the first principal component of the motion direction was observed (p = 0).</p>
