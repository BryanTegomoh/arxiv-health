                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper reviews the current applications and future potential of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) in cancer pathology. It highlights LSFM's capability for visualizing and analyzing a variety of cancer tissue samples, including patient-derived specimens, organoids, biopsies, and murine models, with specific examples in prostate and breast cancer. The authors propose the integration of advanced LSFM into clinical workflows for high-throughput, three-dimensional imaging of intact cancer specimens to enhance diagnostic precision and provide novel insights into tumor architecture.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as it proposes a transformative imaging technology for cancer diagnosis and research. By enabling high-resolution, 3D imaging of intact cancer tissues, it can improve the accuracy of cancer detection, staging, and provide deeper understanding of tumor biology, ultimately guiding more effective patient treatment.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the abstract does not explicitly mention AI, the generation of high-throughput, three-dimensional imaging data from intact cancer specimens (as described for LSFM) is highly amenable to AI/machine learning applications. AI could be used for automated image segmentation, feature extraction, quantitative analysis of tumor morphology and architecture, classification of tumor types, and potentially assisting clinicians in more precise and efficient diagnosis based on these complex datasets.</p>
