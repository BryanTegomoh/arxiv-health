                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel post-hoc framework for medical image segmentation that uses conformal prediction to construct confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. It provides explicit statistical guarantees on the proportion of false positives, enabling reliable and risk-aware segmentation without requiring retraining of the underlying deep learning model, as demonstrated on a polyp-segmentation benchmark.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reliable semantic segmentation is crucial for accurate clinical decision-making, but deep learning models often lack explicit guarantees on their errors, especially false positives. This framework addresses the critical issue of over-segmentation, which can lead to misdiagnosis, unnecessary biopsies, or inappropriate treatment planning, by providing statistically guaranteed control over false positives, thus enhancing patient safety and diagnostic accuracy.</p>

                <p>The paper presents a framework to improve the reliability and safety of AI-powered semantic segmentation models used in medical imaging. Specifically, it offers a method to construct confidence masks that control false-positive predictions with statistical guarantees, which is vital for clinical decision-making, such as in polyp detection where over-segmentation or false positives can lead to unnecessary procedures or misdiagnosis.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed methodology is a post-hoc framework that operates independently of the pretrained segmentation model. It constructs a nested series of shrunken masks from the initial segmentation output by either increasing the prediction score threshold or applying morphological erosion. A separate, labeled calibration dataset is then used in conjunction with conformal prediction to select a single optimal 'shrink parameter.' This selection process is designed to ensure that the proportion of false positive pixels within the final confidence mask remains below a pre-defined user tolerance for new images that are statistically exchangeable with the calibration data, all with a specified high probability. The approach is model-agnostic and does not necessitate any retraining of the original segmentation network.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study's primary finding is the successful demonstration of 'target-level empirical validity' on a polyp-segmentation benchmark. This indicates that the proposed conformal prediction framework effectively controls the rate of false positive predictions in segmented images, ensuring it stays below a user-specified tolerance in real-world scenarios. This confirms the practical utility and statistical soundness of generating risk-aware confidence masks for medical segmentation tasks.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has significant potential to transform the integration of AI in clinical practice by making deep learning segmentation models more trustworthy and accountable. By providing explicit, image-level statistical guarantees on controlling false positives, it mitigates the risks associated with over-segmentation, which can lead to misinterpretations, unnecessary follow-up procedures, or patient anxiety. Clinicians can use AI-generated segmentations with increased confidence, allowing for more precise diagnosis, safer surgical planning, and more targeted interventions, especially in fields like endoscopy where polyp over-segmentation can have immediate clinical consequences.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation noted (implicitly) in the abstract is the assumption of 'new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data.' This implies that the statistical guarantees hold under the condition that future data distributions do not significantly shift from the calibration data, which can be a challenge in dynamic clinical environments. No other explicit limitations are detailed in the abstract.</p>

However, potential future directions could include evaluating the framework's robustness to various forms of distribution shift in real-world clinical datasets, extending the control mechanisms to incorporate other error types such as false negatives, or exploring its application across a broader range of medical imaging modalities and complex anatomical structures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Reliable semantic segmentation is essential for clinical decision making, yet deep models rarely provide explicit statistical guarantees on their errors. We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.</p>
