                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the critical impact of quantization, a technique for efficient LLM deployment, on four key trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness). It identifies significant instability in these metrics across various compression ratios and quantization methods. To address this, the authors propose a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model, consistently improving trustworthiness by up to 5.8%.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In healthcare, AI models, especially LLMs, are increasingly used for tasks like diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and patient interaction. Quantizing these models for efficiency without ensuring trustworthiness can lead to biased clinical decisions, unfair treatment for certain patient groups, vulnerability to malicious data manipulation, or unreliable performance on unexpected patient data, directly jeopardizing patient safety and ethical care.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research is directly applicable to ensuring the trustworthiness and safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) in various medical and healthcare settings. For instance, quantized LLMs could be used for tasks like generating clinical summaries, assisting in diagnostic processes, providing personalized patient information, or aiding in drug discovery. The paper's focus on maintaining adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness even after model compression is crucial for responsible and ethical AI use in healthcare, where errors or biases can have severe patient outcomes. It enables more efficient deployment of complex AI models on resource-constrained medical devices or in distributed healthcare systems while maintaining critical safety standards.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across various tasks. However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.</p>
