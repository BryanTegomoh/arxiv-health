                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach for learning Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) parameters from limited data by integrating expert knowledge. It enriches the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model, effectively reformulating parameter estimation as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) problem. The method demonstrates superior performance over standard EM in synthetic medical simulations under low-data and high-noise conditions and successfully recovers a clinically coherent POMDP in a Myasthenia Gravis case study.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for healthcare as it offers a data-efficient and expert-informed method to model complex medical decision-making and patient pathways, especially for rare diseases or conditions with limited data. By incorporating clinical expertise, it ensures that derived models are not only statistically sound but also clinically plausible and actionable.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm is an AI method (machine learning) designed to learn parameters for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in data-scarce and noisy environments. In a health context, this AI can be applied to model complex medical processes, patient states, disease progression (e.g., Myasthenia Gravis), and treatment outcomes. This can aid in personalized medicine, clinical decision support systems, and optimizing healthcare interventions by providing robust models even when limited patient data is available.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology involves the development of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm. This algorithm extends the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) framework by introducing 'fuzzy pseudo-counts.' These pseudo-counts are generated from an expert-defined fuzzy model, which encapsulates domain-specific knowledge. By integrating these fuzzy pseudo-counts, the parameter estimation problem is naturally reformulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, allowing expert knowledge to act as strong priors that guide the learning process in data-limited and noisy environments.</p>

Crucially, in a real-world case study involving Myasthenia Gravis, the algorithm successfully recovered a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model that was clinically coherent and aligned with medical understanding of the disease progression and treatment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.</p>
