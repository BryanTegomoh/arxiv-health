                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that integrates expert knowledge into POMDP parameter learning through fuzzy pseudo-counts, reformulating the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation. It significantly outperforms the standard EM algorithm in medical simulations with limited and noisy data and successfully recovers a clinically coherent POMDP for Myasthenia Gravis. This method offers a data-efficient solution for robust modeling in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.</p>
