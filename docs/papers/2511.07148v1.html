                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by experts, to address the severe limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in TCM due to a lack of standardized benchmarks and high-quality data. Utilizing a novel Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) method for data enrichment, the authors developed ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art TCM-specific LLM that significantly surpasses the passing threshold for human practitioners.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the
scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we
introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM,
meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated
by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and
propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously
enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection
sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using
this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art
LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing
threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and
development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement
and continuous improvement.</p>
