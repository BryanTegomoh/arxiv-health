                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a unifying theoretical framework, based on 'saddle-to-saddle dynamics,' to explain the widely observed phenomenon of 'simplicity bias' in neural networks, where models trained with gradient descent learn increasingly complex solutions over time. It demonstrates how this dynamic leads to an incremental increase in complexity metrics like rank, kinks, convolutional kernels, or attention heads across diverse architectures, including linear, ReLU, convolutional, and attention networks. The research also elucidates how data distribution and weight initialization influence the learning process, specifically affecting the duration and number of learning plateaus.</p>

                    <p>The methodology is primarily theoretical, involving the development of a unifying framework. It analyzes the dynamics of gradient descent learning by studying fixed points, invariant manifolds, and the transitions between them ('saddle-to-saddle dynamics').

                    <p>The central finding is that 'saddle-to-saddle dynamics' provides a universal explanation for simplicity bias, where gradient descent iteratively progresses through increasingly complex solutions by moving between invariant manifolds via saddle points. This dynamic predictably leads to an increase in specific complexity measures (rank, kinks, kernels, attention heads) across diverse neural network architectures. Furthermore, the study dissociates and clarifies the impact of data distribution and weight initialization on the observed plateaus during learning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.</p>
