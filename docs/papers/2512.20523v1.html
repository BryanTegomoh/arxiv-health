                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study proposes ScoreMatchingRiesz, a novel method for Riesz representer estimation based on score matching, extending techniques from direct density ratio estimation (DRE) and diffusion models. The primary goal is to address the issue of overfitting commonly encountered with flexible models in Riesz representer estimation, which is crucial for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in debiased machine learning (DML) for causal inference and structural parameter estimation. The proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also offers new insights into causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study proposes Riesz representer estimation methods based on score matching. The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.</p>
