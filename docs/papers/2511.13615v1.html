                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Tissue-Aware Nuclei Detection (TAND) is a novel deep learning framework designed for joint nuclei detection and classification in histopathology images, addressing limitations of extensive expert annotations and insufficient tissue context. It integrates a ConvNeXt encoder-decoder with a frozen Virchow-2 tissue segmentation branch, leveraging semantic tissue probabilities via a multi-scale Spatial Feature-wise Linear Modulation (Spatial-FiLM) to condition per-cell classification using only point-level supervision. TAND achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PUMA benchmark, particularly improving classification of tissue-dependent cell types, and offers a practical approach to reduce annotation burden.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>TAND utilizes a ConvNeXt-based encoder-decoder as its primary architecture for nuclei detection and classification. It integrates a secondary, *frozen* Virchow-2 tissue segmentation branch to derive semantic tissue probabilities. These probabilities are then fed into a novel *multi-scale Spatial Feature-wise Linear Modulation (Spatial-FiLM)* module, which selectively conditions or modulates the feature maps within the classification stream. The entire framework is trained with *point-level supervision* for nuclei, minimizing annotation overhead compared to traditional pixel-level mask supervision.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>TAND achieved state-of-the-art performance on the PUMA benchmark, outperforming both methods that ignore tissue context and those requiring full mask-level annotations. A critical finding is the significant improvement in classifying tissue-dependent cell types (e.g., epithelium, endothelium, stroma), directly attributable to the model's novel integration of learned tissue context. This demonstrates the superior efficacy of tissue-aware classification and the potential for robust models with less annotation.</p>

                <p>This approach has substantial clinical impact by potentially streamlining the development of AI diagnostic tools. By reducing the expert annotation burden required to train models, it can accelerate the adoption of computational pathology in clinical settings, making diagnostics faster and more consistent. Improved accuracy in classifying cell types within their tissue context could lead to more precise disease staging, better prognostic predictions, and more targeted therapeutic strategies for patients, especially in oncology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate nuclei detection and classification are fundamental to computational pathology, yet existing approaches are hindered by reliance on detailed expert annotations and insufficient use of tissue context. We present Tissue-Aware Nuclei Detection (TAND), a novel framework achieving joint nuclei detection and classification using point-level supervision enhanced by tissue mask conditioning. TAND couples a ConvNeXt-based encoder-decoder with a frozen Virchow-2 tissue segmentation branch, where semantic tissue probabilities selectively modulate the classification stream through a novel multi-scale Spatial Feature-wise Linear Modulation (Spatial-FiLM). On the PUMA benchmark, TAND achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing both tissue-agnostic baselines and mask-supervised methods. Notably, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tissue-dependent cell types such as epithelium, endothelium, and stroma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to condition per-cell classification on learned tissue masks, offering a practical pathway to reduce annotation burden.</p>
