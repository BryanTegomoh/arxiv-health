                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses gender bias in audio-based depression detection models, which over-diagnose females and underperform on males due to imbalanced training data and spurious correlations. The authors propose a Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference to model and subtract the direct causal effect of gender on predictions. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset demonstrate that their framework significantly reduces gender bias while also improving overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.</p>

                    <p>The study introduces a Counterfactual Debiasing Framework rooted in causal inference. It constructs a causal graph to explicitly model the decision-making process of depression detection and define gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During the inference phase, the framework employs counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model primarily utilizes authentic acoustic pathological features. The methodology was validated through extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, using two advanced acoustic backbones for model training and evaluation.</p>

                    <p>The proposed Counterfactual Debiasing Framework significantly reduces gender bias in audio-based depression detection models. A key finding is that this reduction in bias is accompanied by an improvement in overall detection performance, which also surpasses that of existing debiasing strategies. This indicates that the debiasing approach not only promotes fairness but also enhances model accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.</p>
