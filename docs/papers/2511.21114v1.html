                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), a novel deep learning model designed to automate the learning and prediction of morphological brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. DATGN addresses missing data in MRI sequences, generates future MRI images reflecting disease-specific atrophy, and significantly improves early AD prediction accuracy when its synthetic data is used for classification.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI application develops a Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN) that processes temporal sequences of MRI images to predict the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Specifically, it interpolates missing MRI data, generates future MRI images consistent with disease-related brain atrophy, and significantly improves the accuracy of AI-based classification models (SVM, CNN, 3DCNN) for the early diagnosis and differentiation of Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Normal Cognition. This enables earlier prediction and potentially earlier intervention in a degenerative neurological condition.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The DATGN model operates in two main stages: First, it handles incomplete temporal MRI sequences through an interpolation mechanism. Second, it employs a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware generative module to synthesize future MRI images. This module is designed to capture and apply the morphological changes (like brain atrophy) characteristic of AD progression, thus enabling the generation of future images that reflect disease evolution. The generated images can then be used to augment training datasets for classification tasks.</p>

                    <p>DATGN demonstrated competitive performance in generating future MRI sequences, as indicated by PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Crucially, when synthetic data generated by DATGN was incorporated into conventional classification models (SVM, CNN, 3DCNN), there were significant improvements in accuracy: 6.21% to 16% for AD vs. NC classification and 7.34% to 21.25% for AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers a robust tool for enhancing early Alzheimer's disease prediction. By automatically learning and generating future disease progression from existing MRI data, it can help clinicians anticipate disease onset or progression more accurately. The ability to augment datasets with realistic synthetic progression data could also lead to more robust and generalized diagnostic models, potentially facilitating earlier interventions and personalized treatment strategies for patients at risk or in early stages of AD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.</p>
