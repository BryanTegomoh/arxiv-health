                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN) for the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by automatically learning and generating future brain MRI images reflecting disease progression. DATGN addresses missing data in temporal MRI sequences and significantly improves AD classification accuracy when its generated synthetic data is used to augment training sets for existing classifiers. The network's qualitative outputs demonstrate consistency with characteristic brain atrophy in AD.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN) first employs an interpolation module to reconstruct incomplete temporal sequences of MRI images. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module learns and applies disease progression patterns to generate future MRI images. This module specifically guides the network to produce images that reflect morphological changes, such as brain atrophy, consistent with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The generated images can then be used either for direct qualitative assessment of progression or to augment training datasets for supervised classification models (e.g., SVM, CNN, 3DCNN) to improve prediction accuracy.</p>

                <p>The ability to generate future brain MRI images that depict AD-related atrophy and to significantly improve early AD prediction can have substantial clinical impact. It could enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis, facilitating timely intervention with emerging disease-modifying therapies, improving patient counseling, and optimizing patient selection for clinical trials aiming to slow or halt AD progression. This automation reduces reliance on manual feature extraction and expert interpretation for disease monitoring.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.</p>
