                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Publicly available, large-scale medical imaging datasets are crucial for
developing and validating artificial intelligence models and conducting
retrospective clinical research. However, datasets that combine functional and
anatomical imaging with detailed clinical reports across multiple cancer types
remain scarce. Here, we present PETWB-REP, a curated dataset comprising
whole-body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed
Tomography (PET/CT) scans and corresponding radiology reports from 490 patients
diagnosed with various malignancies. The dataset primarily includes common
cancers such as lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and
ovarian cancer. This dataset includes paired PET and CT images, de-identified
textual reports, and structured clinical metadata. It is designed to support
research in medical imaging, radiomics, artificial intelligence, and
multi-modal learning.</p>
