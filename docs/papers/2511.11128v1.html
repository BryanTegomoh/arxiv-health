                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This randomized controlled trial investigated the efficacy of diode laser photobiomodulation (650 nm, 25 mW) as an adjunctive therapy to mitigate peri-implant inflammation in orthodontic mini-implants. The study found that laser therapy significantly reduced clinical signs of inflammation, inflammatory biomarker (IL-1β) levels, and the incidence of mucositis, thereby enhancing peri-implant health. While improving inflammatory markers, it did not significantly affect implant stability within the observed period.</p>

                    <p>This study employed a randomized controlled trial design involving 30 orthodontic patients (12 males, 18 females, aged 18-32) who had mini-implants implanted bilaterally in the maxilla for anterior teeth retraction.

The contralateral side served as the control, receiving simulated radiation. Clinical assessments, including plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, incidence of peri-implant mucositis, and implant mobility, were performed at 1, 4, and 12 weeks post-implantation. Additionally, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels in peri-implant fluid were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>

Furthermore, IL-1β levels in peri-implant fluid were consistently and significantly lower in the experimental group throughout the study duration (p < 0.05).

                <p>Adjunctive diode laser photobiomodulation presents a significant potential to enhance peri-implant health and mitigate inflammatory complications, such as mucositis, associated with orthodontic mini-implants. This therapy could improve patient comfort, reduce mini-implant failure rates, and contribute to more predictable and successful orthodontic treatment outcomes, offering a non-pharmacological option for inflammation management around these devices.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Peri-implant inflammation in orthodontic mini-implant may lead to patient discomfort and treatment failure. This study aims to evaluate the effects of diode laser application on the health of mini-implant, preventing peri-implantitis and promoting healing. A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 30 orthodontic patients (12 males and 18 females, aged 18-32) who had mini-implants implanted on both sides of the maxilla for anterior teeth retraction. One side of each patient was assigned to either an experimental group receiving diode laser irradiation (650 nm, 25 mW) at specific postoperative intervals or a control group receiving simulated radiation. Clinical assessments included plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, and incidence of peri-implant mucositis and implant mobility, measured at 1, 4, and 12 weeks post-implantation. Additionally, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\b{eta}) levels in peri-implant fluid were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results indicated that the experimental group exhibited significantly lower plaque indices, sulcus bleeding indices, and probing depths (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had fewer cases of peri-implant mucositis (p < 0.05), while differences in implant stability were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). IL-1\b{eta} levels were consistently lower in the experimental group throughout the study duration (p < 0.05). In conclusion, adjunctive diode laser therapy appears to enhance peri-implant health and reduce complications associated with orthodontic mini-implants, suggesting a promising direction for improving patient outcomes in orthodontics. Future research should explore long-term effects and the mechanisms underlying these benefits.</p>
