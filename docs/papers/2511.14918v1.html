                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces X-WIN, a novel chest radiograph (CXR) world model designed to overcome the 2D limitations of CXRs by internalizing 3D volumetric knowledge from chest CT scans. X-WIN learns to predict latent 2D projections of CTs, incorporates real CXRs via masked image modeling, and demonstrates superior performance over existing foundation models on diverse downstream diagnostic tasks. Crucially, it also shows the capability to render 2D projections for reconstructing 3D CT volumes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for medical imaging and diagnosis as it directly addresses a critical limitation of chest X-rays, a pervasive diagnostic tool.

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The X-WIN model is an AI application designed to build a 'world model' for chest radiographs. Its primary application is to enhance the diagnostic utility of 2D CXRs by inferring and internalizing 3D anatomical structures, traditionally only captured by 3D modalities like CT. This allows for improved representation learning and more accurate disease diagnosis from CXRs. Furthermore, it demonstrates the ability to render 2D projections for reconstructing 3D CT volumes, offering a potential pathway for extracting richer 3D information from standard 2D X-rays, which could reduce the need for more complex 3D scans in certain contexts or provide additional insights for medical professionals.</p>

                <p>X-WIN has the potential for significant clinical impact by enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of chest X-rays. By reducing misinterpretations due to structural superposition and providing 3D anatomical context from readily available 2D images, it could lead to more accurate and earlier detection of various chest pathologies. This could translate to improved patient management, more precise treatment planning, and potentially facilitate novel 3D reasoning tools directly from conventional CXRs, which are cheaper and more accessible than CTs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) is an essential medical imaging technique for disease diagnosis. However, as 2D projectional images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition and hence fail to capture 3D anatomies. This limitation makes representation learning and disease diagnosis challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel CXR world model named X-WIN, which distills volumetric knowledge from chest computed tomography (CT) by learning to predict its 2D projections in latent space. The core idea is that a world model with internalized knowledge of 3D anatomical structure can predict CXRs under various transformations in 3D space. During projection prediction, we introduce an affinity-guided contrastive alignment loss that leverages mutual similarities to capture rich, correlated information across projections from the same volume. To improve model adaptability, we incorporate real CXRs into training through masked image modeling and employ a domain classifier to encourage statistically similar representations for real and simulated CXRs. Comprehensive experiments show that X-WIN outperforms existing foundation models on diverse downstream tasks using linear probing and few-shot fine-tuning. X-WIN also demonstrates the ability to render 2D projections for reconstructing a 3D CT volume.</p>
