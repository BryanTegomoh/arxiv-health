                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BioMedJImpact, a large-scale biomedical dataset comprising 1.74 million PubMed Central articles to analyze scientific impact and AI engagement of 2,744 journals. It proposes a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline to derive AI engagement features and uses the dataset to reveal consistent trends: higher collaboration intensity leads to greater citation impact, and AI engagement is an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves constructing the BioMedJImpact dataset from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, integrating bibliometric indicators (e.g., citations), collaboration features (e.g., author team size, diversity), and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. A three-stage LLM pipeline extracts AI engagement by classifying relevance and subfields. Statistical analysis is then performed to examine the correlation between collaboration intensity, AI engagement, and scientific impact (citation impact, quartile rankings) across two time periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). The LLM pipeline is validated through human evaluation for agreement in AI relevance and subfield classification.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Assessing journal impact is central to scholarly communication, yet existing open resources rarely capture how collaboration structures and artificial intelligence (AI) research jointly shape venue prestige in biomedicine. We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.
