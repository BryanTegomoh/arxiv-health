                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces WaveFuse-AL, a novel active learning framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies (BALD, BADGE, Entropy, CoreSet) throughout the learning cycle. By integrating cyclical temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation, WaveFuse-AL dynamically adjusts strategy importance to reduce annotation costs. It consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines across diverse medical imaging tasks, achieving statistically significant performance improvements.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>WaveFuse-AL proposes an active learning framework that adaptively fuses four popular acquisition strategies: BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet. The fusion mechanism leverages cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors, which implicitly account for the active learning cycle, combined with a performance-driven adaptation component that dynamically adjusts the importance (weights) of each strategy based on model performance. The framework was evaluated by applying it to deep learning models for classification and segmentation tasks on three public medical imaging datasets.</p>

                    <p>WaveFuse-AL consistently and significantly outperforms both individual active learning strategies and simple alternating-strategy baselines. Specifically, it achieved statistically significant performance improvements across 10 out of 12 evaluated metric measurements. This demonstrates its superior ability to maximize the utility of limited annotation budgets and efficiently train high-performing models in medical imaging.</p>

                <p>WaveFuse-AL has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost and time required to develop and deploy AI models in clinical settings. By requiring fewer labeled samples to achieve high performance, it can accelerate the creation of diagnostic aids, improve screening programs, and enable the development of AI tools for rare diseases or specialized imaging modalities where expert annotations are extremely scarce and expensive. This ultimately translates to more accessible, efficient, and accurate medical AI solutions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Active learning reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, individual acquisition strategies often exhibit inconsistent behavior across different stages of the active learning cycle. We propose Cyclical and Performance-Adaptive Multi-Strategy Active Learning (WaveFuse-AL), a novel framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies-BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet throughout the learning process. WaveFuse-AL integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust strategy importance over time. We evaluate WaveFuse-AL on three medical imaging benchmarks: APTOS-2019 (multi-class classification), RSNA Pneumonia Detection (binary classification), and ISIC-2018 (skin lesion segmentation). Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFuse-AL consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines, achieving statistically significant performance improvements (on ten out of twelve metric measurements) while maximizing the utility of limited annotation budgets.</p>
