                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method to generate 500k multilingual reasoning traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, grounded in factual medical knowledge from Wikipedia, to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical Question Answering (QA). By employing a retrieval-augmented generation approach and extending existing QA datasets, these traces significantly improve LLM performance in both few-shot and fine-tuning settings, achieving state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter models. The work provides crucial resources to develop safer and more transparent multilingual clinical decision-support tools.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed a method for generating 500,000 multilingual (English, Italian, Spanish) reasoning traces. This involved a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline leveraging factual medical knowledge extracted from Wikipedia. Medical questions were sourced from MedQA and MedMCQA datasets, which were extended and translated into Italian and Spanish to facilitate trace generation. The effectiveness of these traces was then evaluated by integrating them into LLMs via both in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, with performance assessed on medical QA benchmarks in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.</p>

                    <p>The reasoning traces generated through the proposed method significantly improved LLM performance in medical Question Answering. Specifically, their application via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning enabled 8B-parameter LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art results across various medical QA benchmarks, both within and outside their training domain. This demonstrates that grounding LLM reasoning in factual, multilingual medical knowledge substantially enhances reliability and accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have recently demonstrated strong potential in medical Question Answering (QA). Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.</p>
