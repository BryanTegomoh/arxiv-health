                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based medical question-answering (QA) system designed to address challenges of factual accuracy and hallucinations in LLMs for clinical use. By fine-tuning open-source LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Falcon) with LoRA and grounding answers in retrieved medical literature, the system significantly improves accuracy and reduces unsupported content, demonstrating potential for reliable biomedical QA applications. The fine-tuned LLaMA-2 model achieved 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, a substantial improvement over its 55.4% zero-shot baseline.</p>

                    <p>The study involved developing a RAG-based medical QA system. Two state-of-the-art open LLMs, LLaMA-2 and Falcon, were fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for domain-specific knowledge. The core mechanism involves retrieving relevant medical literature to 'ground' the LLM's generated answers, aiming to enhance factual correctness and reduce hallucination. The system's performance was evaluated against benchmark datasets, PubMedQA and MedMCQA, comparing accuracy of RAG-augmented, fine-tuned models against zero-shot baselines and LLMs without retrieval.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical question-answering (QA) systems can benefit from advances in large language models (LLMs), but directly applying LLMs to the clinical domain poses challenges such as maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations. In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications.</p>
