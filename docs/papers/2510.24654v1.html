                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DiagAgent, a novel large language model trained with reinforcement learning in DiagGym, a virtual clinical environment that simulates multi-turn diagnostic processes using electronic health records. DiagAgent learns to adaptively select examinations and commit to final diagnoses, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLMs in diagnostic accuracy and examination recommendation efficiency across various diagnostic settings. The research highlights that interactive learning in clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on training large language models (LLMs), referred to as DiagAgent, using an end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) approach. This training is conducted within a simulated virtual clinical environment called DiagGym, which is a "diagnostics world model" built upon electronic health records (EHRs) to generate realistic examination outcomes. DiagAgent's diagnostic policies are optimized for both information yield and diagnostic accuracy. Performance is rigorously evaluated using DiagBench, a multi-faceted benchmark that includes physician-validated examination recommendations and physician-written rubrics for assessing the diagnostic process.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>DiagAgent achieved superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. In single-turn scenarios, it demonstrated 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and a 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. For end-to-end diagnostic processes, it delivered a 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and a 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. Notably, in rubric-based evaluations, DiagAgent outperformed the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score, indicating a more clinically sound diagnostic process. These results collectively highlight that learning through interactive clinical environments grants LLMs dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities beyond passively trained models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.</p>
