                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated unimodal and multimodal deep learning models for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in 116 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) treated with 177Lu-DOTATOC PRRT. The research found that a multimodal fusion model, combining laboratory values, pre-therapeutic SR-PET, and CT imaging, significantly outperformed unimodal approaches, achieving an AUROC of 0.72 for classifying short vs. long PFS.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This was a retrospective, single-center study involving 116 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) treated with 177Lu-DOTATOC. Data collected included clinical characteristics, baseline laboratory values (e.g., chromogranin A, gamma-GT), and pre-therapeutic somatostatin receptor PET/CT (SR-PET/CT) images. Seven distinct models were trained for binary classification of low-PFS (<1 year) vs. high-PFS (>1 year). These included unimodal approaches (Random Forest for laboratory data, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for SR-PET and CT images) and multimodal deep learning fusion models. The most successful multimodal model integrated laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT, further augmented with a pretrained CT branch. Model explainability was assessed via feature importance analysis and gradient maps.</p>

                    <p>The multimodal deep learning fusion model, incorporating laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT imaging (augmented with a pretrained CT branch), achieved the best predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.72 ± 0.01 and an AUPRC of 0.80 ± 0.01.

Furthermore, baseline analysis revealed that patients with shorter PFS had significantly higher baseline chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT cycles (p < 0.001).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The development of a robust multimodal deep learning model for PFS prediction has the potential to profoundly impact clinical decision-making for NET patients undergoing PRRT. By accurately identifying patients at high risk of early progression, clinicians can tailor individualized treatment plans, consider more aggressive or alternative therapies, or implement risk-adapted follow-up strategies. This could optimize patient outcomes, reduce unnecessary procedures for low-risk patients, and improve resource allocation within healthcare systems.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study was retrospective and conducted at a single academic center, which inherently limits the generalizability of the findings to a broader, more diverse patient population. The cohort size of 116 patients, while suitable for initial model development, is relatively small for deep learning applications. Importantly, the reported model performance is based on internal validation, implying a need for external validation on independent datasets to confirm robustness and generalizability before clinical implementation.</p>

                <p>The authors explicitly highlight the need for external validation of these multimodal deep learning models on larger, independent datasets. Successful external validation would be crucial for solidifying their clinical utility and paving the way for their integration into routine clinical practice to support risk-adapted follow-up strategies for NET patients post-PRRT.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.</p>
