                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The `geohabnet` R package is introduced as a novel tool for mapping habitat connectivity, which moves beyond traditional habitat quality assessments to evaluate the potential importance of geographic locations for species spread. It employs a network framework that incorporates dispersal probabilities and habitat availability, offering a reproducible and scalable approach to support biosecurity, invasion science, and conservation efforts for host-dependent species like pathogens and arthropod pests.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This package is highly relevant for public health and infectious disease epidemiology by offering a robust, spatial analytical framework to predict and monitor the spread of vector-borne diseases, zoonotic pathogens, and disease vectors (arthropod pests) based on environmental connectivity, enabling proactive surveillance and control strategies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes an R package that uses network analysis and computational modeling to map habitat connectivity and predict species spread. While it is a sophisticated computational tool for spatial analysis and surveillance prioritization, it does not explicitly describe itself as employing artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) techniques. It provides a foundational tool for data-driven decision making in epidemiology and biosecurity, which could be integrated into broader AI-driven systems for public health, but it is not an AI application itself.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The `geohabnet` R package implements a network framework where geographic locations represent nodes and potential dispersal pathways represent edges. It integrates data on habitat availability and species-specific dispersal probabilities. Six standard network centrality metrics are then computed for each node to evaluate its importance in facilitating species spread, allowing for analysis across various geographic scales using user-provided or publicly available datasets.</p>

                    <p>The primary 'finding' is the development and validation of the `geohabnet` R package as a functional, open-source tool. It effectively: 1) Quantifies the relative importance of geographic locations for species spread by considering habitat connectivity, which often differs from mere habitat quality. 2) Identifies critical 'bridge' locations that, despite potentially lower habitat quality, play a major role in species dispersal by connecting otherwise fragmented regions. 3) Provides a reproducible and scalable methodology for assessing expansion scenarios for host-dependent species, enabling data-driven prioritization of surveillance and management efforts.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>`geohabnet` can significantly enhance public health and clinical decision-making by enabling: 1) **Targeted Surveillance:** Identifying high-risk geographic locations for the introduction or spread of human pathogens (e.g., arboviruses, zoonotic agents) or their vectors, optimizing resource allocation for monitoring. 2) **Intervention Prioritization:** Informing the strategic deployment of vector control measures, vaccination campaigns, or public health messaging by pinpointing key connectivity hubs. 3) **Predictive Modeling:** Supporting early warning systems for emerging infectious diseases by simulating potential spread pathways and identifying vulnerable populations or regions. 4) **Biosecurity Enhancement:** Providing spatial intelligence for national and international biosecurity programs aimed at preventing transboundary disease transmission.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and
environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations
are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes
geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations
in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with
high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are
geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a
major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that
would otherwise be physically fragmented.
  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential
importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes.
geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat
availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat
connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or
pollinators.
  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network
centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples
using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in
Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply
geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated
importance of geographic locations for species spread.
  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to
quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic
scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through
habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science,
and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary
pathogens, pests, or endangered species.</p>
