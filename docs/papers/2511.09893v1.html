                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system. The Swin Transformer acts as the image encoder, extracting visual features, while a BART model functions as the text decoder, generating captions. A lightweight regional attention module is introduced before the cross-attention layers to prioritize and amplify diagnostically salient image regions. The model was trained and evaluated on the ROCO dataset. Decoding employs beam search with specific parameters (beam size=4, length penalty=1.1, no_repeat_ngram_size=3, max length=128). Performance was assessed using various NLG metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR) and through ablation studies, per-modality analysis (CT, MRI, X-ray), and significance tests.</p>

It also showed competitive performance across BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the regional attention module.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research contributes a robust tool that can generate accurate, clinically phrased diagnostic narratives from medical images, directly supporting radiologists in their reporting tasks. The interpretability features, such as regional heatmaps, can build clinician trust by showing the specific image areas influencing the generated text. This enables safer integration into clinical workflows, augmenting human capabilities and potentially improving efficiency and consistency in medical diagnostics, especially with a human 'in the loop' for review and validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.</p>
