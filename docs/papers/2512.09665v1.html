                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces OxEnsemble, a novel approach for fair classification specifically designed for low-data regimes with unbalanced demographic groups, common in critical domains like medical imaging. OxEnsemble achieves fairness by training individual ensemble members with fairness constraints and then aggregating their predictions. It is presented as both data-efficient, through careful reuse of held-out data, and compute-efficient, demonstrating stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs and more consistent outcomes than existing methods on medical imaging datasets, supported by theoretical guarantees.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medical imaging and diagnostics as it enables the development of AI systems that provide fair and equitable outcomes across diverse patient populations, even with limited and imbalanced data, thereby mitigating the risk of critical misdiagnoses (false negatives) that could have severe, even fatal, consequences.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research develops an AI method (OxEnsemble) designed to improve the fairness and reliability of classification models in medical imaging, especially when data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>OxEnsemble is an ensemble learning framework where multiple models are trained. Uniquely, each individual model within the ensemble is explicitly trained to satisfy specific fairness constraints. The final prediction is derived by aggregating the constrained predictions from these individual ensemble members. The method emphasizes efficient resource utilization by carefully reusing held-out data to robustly enforce fairness and is designed to be compute-efficient, with minimal overhead. The approach's soundness is supported by new theoretical guarantees.</p>

By ensuring that AI models in medical imaging are fair across various patient demographics and maintain high accuracy even with scarce data, it can help prevent biased diagnoses, reduce health disparities, and crucially, minimize the occurrence of critical false negatives in sensitive areas such as disease screening and detection, ultimately leading to safer and more equitable patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.</p>
