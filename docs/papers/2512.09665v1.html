                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">OxEnsemble is a novel ensemble learning approach designed to achieve fair classification in challenging low-data and demographically unbalanced settings, particularly relevant to medical imaging where false negatives can be fatal. It efficiently trains ensembles by aggregating predictions from members, each specifically constrained for fairness, demonstrating superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs and more consistent outcomes on medical datasets compared to existing methods.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.</p>
