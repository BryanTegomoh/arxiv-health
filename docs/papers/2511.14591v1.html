                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the complex interaction between AI bias (class imbalance) and human bias (base rate neglect) in decision-making contexts involving AI-based decision-support systems. It found that class imbalance negatively impacted participants' ability to appropriately calibrate their reliance on AI, and crucially, identified a mutually reinforcing effect between these two biases, leading to a compound human-AI bias.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In medical diagnosis and treatment planning, AI decision-support systems are increasingly common. This research highlights how inherent biases in AI training data (e.g., class imbalance for rare diseases) combined with human cognitive biases (e.g., neglecting disease prevalence) can lead to inappropriate reliance on AI, potentially resulting in misdiagnoses or suboptimal patient care, especially for conditions with skewed prevalence.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>A within-subject online study was conducted with 46 participants. Participants classified three different diseases using an AI-based decision-support system. The AI system was presented in two conditions: trained on a balanced dataset or trained on an unbalanced dataset, allowing for the assessment of how class imbalance affects human reliance and its interaction with base rate neglect.</p>

(2) There were mutually reinforcing effects observed between AI-induced class imbalance and human base rate neglect, providing evidence for a compound human-AI bias.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>These findings are critical for the development and deployment of AI in healthcare. They suggest that clinicians using AI diagnostic tools may miscalibrate their reliance due to AI biases interacting with their own cognitive biases. This could lead to an increased risk of misdiagnoses, especially for rare diseases or conditions with low prevalence that are often underrepresented in training data. To mitigate this, AI systems need robust bias mitigation strategies, and training for clinicians must address not just AI capabilities but also the potential for synergistic human-AI biases to ensure safe and effective patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.</p>
