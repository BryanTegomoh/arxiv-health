                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a simulation study of CrowN@22, a novel head monitoring device designed to mitigate motion artifacts during brain PET scans. Utilizing six low-activity non-pure positron emitter point sources (e.g., 22Na) in a crown-like arrangement, the device leverages specific gamma photon detection (e.g., 1274 keV from 22Na) to achieve a superb signal-to-noise ratio. The simulation demonstrates its capability to track head movements with a precision of less than 0.3 degrees or 0.5 mm at a 1 Hz sampling rate, even in the presence of high background brain activity.</p>

                <p>The implementation of CrowN@22 could dramatically enhance the quality and reliability of brain PET images by effectively correcting for patient motion, which currently introduces significant artifacts. This would allow for more accurate lesion detection, quantification of radiotracer uptake, and improved diagnostic confidence in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and brain tumors. Ultimately, it could lead to better patient management and potentially reduce the need for repeat scans.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">When acquiring PET images, body motions are unavoidable, given that the
acquisition time could last 10-20 minutes or more. These motions can seriously
deteriorate the quality of the final image at the level of image reconstruction
and attenuation corrections. Movements can have rhythmic patterns, related to
respiratory or cardiac motions, or they can be abrupt reflexive actions caused
by the patient's discomfort. Many approaches, software and hardware, have been
developed to mitigate this problem where each approach has its own advantages
and disadvantages. In this work we present a simulation study of a head
monitoring device, named CrowN@22, intended to be used in conjunction with a
dedicated brain PET scanner. The CrowN@22 device consists of six point sources
of non-pure positron emitter isotopes, such as 22Na or 44Sc, mounted in
crown-like rings around the head of the patient. The relative positions of the
point sources are predefined and their actual position, once mounted, can be
reconstructed by tagging the extra 1274 keV photon (in the case of 22Na). These
two factors contribute to a superb signal-to-noise ratio, distinguishing
between the signal from the 22Na monitor point sources and the background
signal from the FDG in the brain. Hence, even with a low activity for the
monitor point sources, as low as 10 kBq per point source, in the presence of 75
MBq activity of 18F in the brain, one can detect brain movements with a
precision of less than 0.3 degrees, or 0.5 mm, which is of the order of the PET
spatial resolution, at a sampling rate of 1 Hz.</p>
