                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a simulated head monitoring device, CrowN@22, designed for brain PET scanners to counteract motion artifacts during long acquisitions. By utilizing point sources of non-pure positron emitters like 22Na and detecting their unique accompanying gamma photons, the device achieves exceptional signal-to-noise ratio. The simulation demonstrates highly precise head movement detection, less than 0.5 mm or 0.3 degrees, at a 1 Hz sampling rate, even in the presence of high brain FDG activity, significantly improving PET image quality.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study was a simulation study of a head monitoring device named CrowN@22. The device model incorporated six pre-defined point sources of non-pure positron emitter isotopes (e.g., 22Na or 44Sc) mounted in crown-like rings around a virtual patient's head. The methodology for position reconstruction relies on the unique detection of a characteristic additional high-energy photon (e.g., 1274 keV for 22Na) emitted by these isotopes, allowing for its signal to be distinguished from the 511 keV annihilation photons produced by the PET tracer (e.g., 18F-FDG) in the brain.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The simulation study demonstrated that the CrowN@22 device can detect brain movements with a precision of less than 0.3 degrees or 0.5 mm, which is comparable to the intrinsic spatial resolution of PET. This high precision is achievable at a sampling rate of 1 Hz, even when using very low monitor source activity (10 kBq per source) in the presence of high background activity from a typical brain PET tracer (75 MBq of 18F), due to the superb signal-to-noise ratio offered by the unique photon tagging mechanism.</p>

                <p>By precisely tracking and correcting for head movements, this technology has the potential to significantly improve the diagnostic quality and quantitative accuracy of brain PET images. This would lead to more reliable assessment of brain metabolism, receptor binding, and lesion detection, benefiting the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and brain tumors, especially in patients prone to movement.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">When acquiring PET images, body motions are unavoidable, given that the
acquisition time could last 10-20 minutes or more. These motions can seriously
deteriorate the quality of the final image at the level of image reconstruction
and attenuation corrections. Movements can have rhythmic patterns, related to
respiratory or cardiac motions, or they can be abrupt reflexive actions caused
by the patient's discomfort. Many approaches, software and hardware, have been
developed to mitigate this problem where each approach has its own advantages
and disadvantages. In this work we present a simulation study of a head
monitoring device, named CrowN@22, intended to be used in conjunction with a
dedicated brain PET scanner. The CrowN@22 device consists of six point sources
of non-pure positron emitter isotopes, such as 22Na or 44Sc, mounted in
crown-like rings around the head of the patient. The relative positions of the
point sources are predefined and their actual position, once mounted, can be
reconstructed by tagging the extra 1274 keV photon (in the case of 22Na). These
two factors contribute to a superb signal-to-noise ratio, distinguishing
between the signal from the 22Na monitor point sources and the background
signal from the FDG in the brain. Hence, even with a low activity for the
monitor point sources, as low as 10 kBq per point source, in the presence of 75
MBq activity of 18F in the brain, one can detect brain movements with a
precision of less than 0.3 degrees, or 0.5 mm, which is of the order of the PET
spatial resolution, at a sampling rate of 1 Hz.</p>
