                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a simulation study of CrowN@22, a novel head monitoring device designed to mitigate patient head movement artifacts during brain PET imaging. By utilizing crown-like rings of low-activity non-pure positron emitter sources (e.g., 22Na) and uniquely tagging their additional gamma photon emissions, the device aims to precisely track head movements with a superb signal-to-noise ratio. The simulation demonstrates the ability to detect movements with high precision (< 0.3 degrees or 0.5 mm) at a 1 Hz sampling rate, even in the presence of high brain activity, significantly improving PET image quality.</p>

                    <p>This is a simulation study of a proposed hardware device, CrowN@22. The device's concept involves using six low-activity point sources of non-pure positron emitters (e.g., 22Na) mounted in a crown configuration.

This high precision is achieved at a sampling rate of 1 Hz, with remarkably low monitor source activity (10 kBq per source) even against a high background brain activity (75 MBq of 18F), attributed to a superb signal-to-noise ratio enabled by the unique photon tagging mechanism.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">When acquiring PET images, body motions are unavoidable, given that the
acquisition time could last 10-20 minutes or more. These motions can seriously
deteriorate the quality of the final image at the level of image reconstruction
and attenuation corrections. Movements can have rhythmic patterns, related to
respiratory or cardiac motions, or they can be abrupt reflexive actions caused
by the patient's discomfort. Many approaches, software and hardware, have been
developed to mitigate this problem where each approach has its own advantages
and disadvantages. In this work we present a simulation study of a head
monitoring device, named CrowN@22, intended to be used in conjunction with a
dedicated brain PET scanner. The CrowN@22 device consists of six point sources
of non-pure positron emitter isotopes, such as 22Na or 44Sc, mounted in
crown-like rings around the head of the patient. The relative positions of the
point sources are predefined and their actual position, once mounted, can be
reconstructed by tagging the extra 1274 keV photon (in the case of 22Na). These
two factors contribute to a superb signal-to-noise ratio, distinguishing
between the signal from the 22Na monitor point sources and the background
signal from the FDG in the brain. Hence, even with a low activity for the
monitor point sources, as low as 10 kBq per point source, in the presence of 75
MBq activity of 18F in the brain, one can detect brain movements with a
precision of less than 0.3 degrees, or 0.5 mm, which is of the order of the PET
spatial resolution, at a sampling rate of 1 Hz.</p>
