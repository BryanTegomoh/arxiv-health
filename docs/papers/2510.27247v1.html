                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Brain-to-speech (BTS) systems represent a groundbreaking approach to human
communication by enabling the direct transformation of neural activity into
linguistic expressions. While recent non-invasive BTS studies have largely
focused on decoding predefined words or sentences, achieving open-vocabulary
neural communication comparable to natural human interaction requires decoding
unconstrained speech. Additionally, effectively integrating diverse signals
derived from speech is crucial for developing personalized and adaptive neural
communication and rehabilitation solutions for patients. This study
investigates the potential of speech synthesis for previously unseen sentences
across various speech modes by leveraging phoneme-level information extracted
from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals, both independently and
in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) signals. Furthermore, we examine the
properties affecting phoneme decoding accuracy during sentence reconstruction
and offer neurophysiological insights to further enhance EEG decoding for more
effective neural communication solutions. Our findings underscore the
feasibility of biosignal-based sentence-level speech synthesis for
reconstructing unseen sentences, highlighting a significant step toward
developing open-vocabulary neural communication systems adapted to diverse
patient needs and conditions. Additionally, this study provides meaningful
insights into the development of communication and rehabilitation solutions
utilizing EEG-based decoding technologies.</p>
