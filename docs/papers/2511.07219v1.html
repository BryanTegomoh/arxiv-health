                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>EpiCAge is a multimodal machine learning framework that integrates distinct data types: epigenetic features (e.g., DNA methylation) and phenotypic features (e.g., clinical, demographic data). Its performance was validated by comparison against established epigenetic and phenotypic age clocks on eight internal and four external cancer cohorts. Statistical analysis was used to assess the association between EpiCAge-derived age acceleration and mortality risk.</p>

                    <p>EpiCAge significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art epigenetic and phenotypic age prediction models. It successfully identifies biologically relevant markers contributing to biological age. Crucially, the age acceleration predicted by EpiCAge is significantly correlated with mortality risk in cancer patients, establishing its prognostic value.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>EpiCAge has the potential to revolutionize personalized oncology by providing a more precise biological age assessment. This can lead to improved risk stratification for cancer patients, facilitate more targeted and effective treatment planning based on biological rather than chronological age, and enhance survivorship care strategies, ultimately leading to better patient management and outcomes.</p>

                <p>Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but the characterization of EpiCAge as a "promising multimodal machine learning tool" implies future work would involve further validation in larger and more diverse cohorts, exploration of its utility across a wider range of cancer types and stages, and potential integration into clinical decision support systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Biological age, which may be older or younger than chronological age due to
factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, serves as a
meaningful biomarker of aging processes and can inform risk stratification,
treatment planning, and survivorship care in cancer patients. We propose
EpiCAge, a multimodal framework that integrates epigenetic and phenotypic data
to improve biological age prediction. Evaluated on eight internal and four
external cancer cohorts, EpiCAge consistently outperforms existing epigenetic
and phenotypic age clocks. Our analyses show that EpiCAge identifies
biologically relevant markers, and its derived age acceleration is
significantly associated with mortality risk. These results highlight EpiCAge
as a promising multimodal machine learning tool for biological age assessment
in oncology.</p>
