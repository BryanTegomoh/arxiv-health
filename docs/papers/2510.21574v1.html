                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a two-stage pretraining and application process. First, Graph Neural Networks are trained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark to learn fundamental algorithmic reasoning patterns. Second, the learned weights from these pretrained GNNs are used to initialize and freeze specific layers within a separate GNN architecture. This partially initialized and frozen GNN is then applied to solve molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark, specifically `ogbg-molhiv` and `ogbg-molclintox`, with its performance compared to a randomly initialized baseline model.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study's key findings demonstrate that pretraining GNNs on classical algorithms significantly enhances their performance on molecular property prediction tasks. Specifically, models pretrained on classical algorithms either consistently outperformed or tied with randomly initialized baselines. A major result was a 6% absolute performance gain on the `ogbg-molhiv` (HIV inhibition) task when using `Segments Intersect` algorithm pretraining, and a 3% absolute gain on the `ogbg-molclintox` (clinical toxicity) task through `Dijkstra` algorithm pretraining. These gains underscore the effectiveness of transferring algorithmic priors to instill beneficial inductive biases in GNNs for complex graph data.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The enhanced accuracy in predicting molecular properties directly translates to a significant clinical impact. By improving the ability to predict HIV inhibition, researchers can more efficiently identify compounds with therapeutic potential against HIV. Similarly, better prediction of clinical toxicity can help filter out unsafe drug candidates earlier in the development pipeline, reducing costly failures in clinical trials and accelerating the availability of safer drugs. This approach has the potential to streamline drug discovery, decrease development costs, and ultimately bring more effective and safer treatments to patients faster.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.</p>
