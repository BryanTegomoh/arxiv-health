                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper analyzes SIR models that incorporate realistic features like demography, a bounded random transmission coefficient, and a time-dependent vaccination strategy targeting susceptible individuals. It establishes the existence and uniqueness of global non-negative solutions for these complex models, deriving crucial conditions that determine whether a disease will be eradicated or become endemic.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding how demography, random fluctuations in transmission, and dynamic vaccination strategies affect disease outcomes is crucial for designing more effective public health interventions and predicting epidemic trajectories in real-world scenarios. This model offers a more robust framework for such predictions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the mathematical models developed in this paper could serve as foundational components or data for AI-driven epidemiological forecasting, resource allocation optimization, or policy simulation tools (e.g., using AI to explore optimal vaccination schedules based on these models), the paper itself does not describe or implement an AI application to health. It focuses on the mathematical and theoretical aspects of the SIR model.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors employ rigorous mathematical analysis to investigate the asymptotic behavior of a system of differential equations (likely ordinary or stochastic, given the random coefficient) representing the SIR model. This involves proving existence and uniqueness of non-negative global solutions and deriving analytical conditions for disease eradication or endemicity. These theoretical findings are then supported and illustrated through numerical simulations.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Existence and uniqueness of non-negative global solutions were rigorously established for SIR models featuring demography, a bounded random transmission coefficient, and a time-dependent vaccination rate. Crucially, specific mathematical criteria were derived that predict whether the disease will eventually be eradicated or if it will reach an endemic state within the population, accounting for the complex interplay of these factors.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more robust theoretical framework for public health decision-making regarding vaccination strategies. It can aid in predicting the long-term success of vaccination campaigns under more realistic conditions (e.g., varying vaccine uptake, demographic shifts, environmental stochasticity) and help tailor interventions to achieve disease eradication or control endemic diseases more effectively by understanding the critical thresholds.</p>

                <p class="abstract">In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of some SIR models
incorporating demography, bounded random transmission coefficient and a
time-dependent vaccination strategy targeting the susceptible population. In
this setting, we establish the existence and uniqueness of non-negative global
solution of the models and derive conditions under which either the disease is
eradicated or becomes endemic. In addition, the theoretical results are further
illustrated by several numerical simulations.</p>
