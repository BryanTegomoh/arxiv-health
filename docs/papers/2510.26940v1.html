                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper reveals significant demographic disparities in state-of-the-art mobility prediction models, where predictive performance varies widely across racial and ethnic user groups due to underlying dataset biases. To counteract this, the authors propose Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), which, alongside a novel Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM) clustering method for inferring proxy demographic labels, incrementally builds fairer training datasets. FGIS successfully reduces inter-group performance disparities by up to 40% with minimal overall accuracy loss, demonstrating impactful fairness gains, especially in low-resource settings.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Disparities in mobility prediction directly translate to inequities in public health outcomes, as many public health applications (e.g., disease surveillance, resource allocation, emergency response planning) rely heavily on accurate and equitable understanding of population movement. Ensuring fair predictions across all demographic groups is critical for effective, just, and non-discriminatory public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper focuses on improving the fairness and reducing demographic bias in AI models designed for mobility prediction. When these mobility prediction models are applied in public health (e.g., for tracking disease spread, allocating medical resources, or planning emergency responses), the methods proposed in this paper ensure that the predictions are equitable across different racial and ethnic groups. This prevents AI-driven public health initiatives from inadvertently exacerbating existing health disparities due to biased models.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study began by auditing state-of-the-art mobility prediction models (e.g., MetaPath2Vec, transformer-encoder) on a large-scale dataset to identify systematic performance disparities across racial and ethnic user groups, leveraging aggregate census data to define these groups. To address this, they introduced Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), an active learning strategy. A core component of FGIS is Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a custom clustering method that partitions users within a latent mobility space while incorporating and enforcing census-derived group proportions to generate proxy racial labels. FGIS then uses these proxy labels to incrementally select training data, prioritizing users based on expected performance gains and current group representation to optimize for both fairness and overall accuracy.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>A systematic and significant disparity in predictive performance was identified across racial and ethnic user groups, directly stemming from biases in the underlying large-scale mobility datasets. The proposed FGIS method, leveraging SAKM-derived proxy labels, effectively reduced the total disparity between groups by up to 40% while incurring only minimal trade-offs in overall prediction accuracy. Notably, the most substantial improvements in fairness were observed during the early stages of incremental sampling, indicating the method's strong efficacy even in data-scarce environments and its potential to expose and mitigate structural inequities.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research enables the development of more equitable and reliable public health and medical applications that depend on mobility data. By reducing demographic performance gaps, models for infectious disease spread prediction, targeted health campaign planning (e.g., vaccination drives), or optimization of emergency service deployment can become fairer, ensuring that interventions are equally effective and accessible across all racial and ethnic communities. This minimizes the risk of inadvertently widening existing health disparities and enhances the overall impact and trustworthiness of data-driven health initiatives.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation noted is the unavailability of individual-level demographic labels, which necessitated the development and reliance on proxy labeling methods (SAKM) based on aggregate census data. This introduces a degree of approximation in group assignments. Additionally, the focus on the four largest racial/ethnic groups in the state might not capture disparities affecting smaller or more intersectional demographic groups.</p>

This encourages further exploration and application of similar fairness-aware sampling, clustering, and data imputation techniques across a broader range of demographic factors, diverse geographic contexts, and other medical/public health prediction tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.</p>
