                    <p>The methodology involved two core components: 1) **Dataset Construction**: A large-scale dataset was assembled from over 5,000 PET/CT exams, generating >11,000 lesion-level descriptions and corresponding 3D segmentations using a hybrid pipeline combining rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs). 2) **Model Development (PETAR-4B)**: A 3D mask-aware vision-language model was proposed. This model integrates volumetric PET and CT images along with 3D lesion contours as input to generate spatially grounded and localized findings for radiology reports, utilizing both global contextual reasoning and fine-grained lesion awareness.</p>

                <p>This research has significant potential to revolutionize PET/CT reporting by automating the generation of localized and clinically coherent findings. This could reduce the cognitive load and dictation time for radiologists, increase report consistency and standardization, and potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in busy clinical settings, particularly for conditions requiring detailed lesion analysis such as oncology. It could also serve as a foundational tool for training, quality control, and large-scale research in medical imaging.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</p>
