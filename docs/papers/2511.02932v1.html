                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In clinical proteomics, available input is often limited. In addition,
phospho-proteomics is of particular interest since the dysregulation of these
post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been implicated in various diseases
such as cancer. We therefore assessed the feasibility of low input
phospho-proteomics via phospho-bulk titration and low-input starting material.
We found that there was identification of more phospho-peptides through
phospho-bulk titration because of sample loss during preparation of low input
starting material. Additionally, we explored various lysis buffers and boiling
times for efficiency of decrosslinking formalin-fixed cells since cells and
tissues are often fixed for preservation and sorting via FACS. We found that
boiling in 0.05M Tris pH 7.6 with 5% SDS for 60 min yielded the highest number
of phospho-peptides. Lastly, we applied Evotips Pure and phospho-bulk titration
to treated Jurkat cells and identified 7 phospho-sites involved in T-cell
stimulation.</p>
