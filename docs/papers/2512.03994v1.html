                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel, training-free method for detecting policy violations in large language models (LLMs), crucial for sensitive domains like medical services. It re-frames the problem as out-of-distribution detection by applying activation-space whitening to transform the LLM's hidden activations, using the Euclidean norm as a compliance score. The approach is efficient, requires minimal data, and achieves state-of-the-art results on policy benchmarks, offering a practical framework for LLM governance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method directly addresses a critical challenge for deploying LLMs in healthcare: ensuring strict adherence to medical ethics, patient privacy (HIPAA), clinical guidelines, and hospital-specific protocols. It offers a way to detect subtle deviations from established medical policies, which is essential for safe and responsible AI integration in patient care and health information management.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a framework for ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) used in healthcare adhere to specific organizational policies, ethical guidelines, and regulatory frameworks (e.g., patient privacy, diagnostic protocols, information disclaimers). By detecting policy violations in a training-free and efficient manner, it enables the safer and more reliable deployment of AI in medical services, such as clinical assistance, patient communication, medical record analysis, and administrative tasks, thereby reducing risks associated with misinformation, privacy breaches, or non-compliance with clinical standards.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The method re-conceptualizes policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. It involves applying a linear transformation, inspired by whitening techniques, to the hidden activations of an LLM. This transformation decorrelates the activations and standardizes them to have zero mean and unit variance, effectively yielding a near-identity covariance matrix. In this decorrelated, standardized activation space, the Euclidean norm is then used as a compliance score, where a higher norm indicates a greater likelihood of policy violation (i.e., being 'out-of-distribution' from compliant responses). The approach is training-free, requiring only the policy text and a few illustrative examples.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology has significant potential to enhance the safety and trustworthiness of LLM deployments in healthcare. It can be used to automatically flag or prevent LLMs from generating responses that violate patient privacy (e.g., HIPAA), deviate from established clinical guidelines, or offer unethical/misleading medical advice. By providing a rapid, efficient, and interpretable mechanism, it enables healthcare organizations to tailor LLM oversight to specific institutional policies and accelerate the safe deployment of AI in critical medical applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.
