                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed method treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. It leverages 'activation-space whitening,' a technique where a linear transformation is applied to the hidden activations of an LLM. This transformation aims to decorrelate the activations and standardize them to have a zero mean and unit variance, effectively yielding a near-identity covariance matrix. In this newly transformed, whitened activation space, the Euclidean norm of the activations is calculated. This norm serves as a 'compliance score,' where a higher norm indicates a greater deviation from the expected distribution of policy-compliant responses, thus flagging a potential policy violation. The method is training-free and only requires the policy text and a minimal set of illustrative, compliant samples to establish the baseline for the whitened space.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study demonstrates that the training-free activation-space whitening approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting LLM policy violations on a challenging benchmark. It significantly surpasses the efficacy of existing guardrail systems and even more flexible fine-tuned reasoning models. The method's key strengths include its efficiency, interpretability (due to its statistical foundation), and its lightweight nature, requiring minimal input (policy text and a few samples) for deployment.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology has substantial potential to enhance patient safety and regulatory compliance when integrating LLMs into clinical and administrative healthcare workflows. It can proactively identify and mitigate risks such as an LLM providing inaccurate medical advice, breaching patient confidentiality (e.g., PHI violations), generating unethical recommendations, or failing to adhere to specific clinical protocols. By enabling real-time, robust policy enforcement, it allows healthcare providers to deploy AI with greater confidence, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM-powered applications in sensitive medical contexts.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly detail specific limitations of the proposed activation-space whitening method. However, it implicitly suggests a practical requirement for a 'small number of illustrative samples,' which, while minimal, is still necessary to define the compliant baseline. The generalizability of its performance on the 'challenging policy benchmark' to the full spectrum of complex, evolving, and highly nuanced real-world medical policies is not extensively discussed within the abstract.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.
