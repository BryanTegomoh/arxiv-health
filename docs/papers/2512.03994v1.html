                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel training-free method for robust policy violation detection in LLMs by framing it as an out-of-distribution problem. It leverages activation-space whitening to decorrelate and standardize hidden LLM activations, using the Euclidean norm in this transformed space as an efficient and interpretable compliance score. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on policy benchmarks, outperforming existing guardrails and fine-tuned models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is highly relevant for the safe and compliant deployment of LLMs in medical services, where adherence to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, clinical protocols) and ethical guidelines is paramount, thus mitigating legal, reputational, and patient safety risks.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research enables the development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare settings while ensuring they adhere to specific organizational policies, ethical guidelines, and regulatory frameworks. For example, it could be used to detect if an LLM providing clinical decision support generates advice that violates established medical protocols, if a patient-facing chatbot shares sensitive information inappropriately, or if an LLM assisting with medical research misinterprets data privacy policies. It provides a mechanism for robust policy-aware oversight, which is crucial for the safe, ethical, and effective integration of AI into medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The approach frames policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. It applies a linear transformation, termed 'activation-space whitening,' to the hidden activations of a large language model. This transformation decorrelates the activations and standardizes them to zero mean and unit variance. In this decorrelated space, the Euclidean norm of the whitened activations serves as a compliance score; a higher norm indicates a greater deviation from 'in-policy' behavior and thus a potential violation. The method is training-free, requiring only the policy text and a small set of representative policy-compliant samples to establish the baseline activation distribution.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework offers a practical and statistically grounded mechanism for real-time oversight of LLMs in healthcare settings. It can ensure that AI-generated clinical notes, patient advice, or diagnostic aids strictly adhere to institutional guidelines, patient privacy laws (like HIPAA), and medical best practices. This reduces the risk of generating medically inappropriate, non-compliant, or unethical content, thereby enhancing patient safety, fostering trust in AI tools, and protecting healthcare organizations from legal liabilities.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly detail limitations of the proposed method itself. However, it implicitly relies on the quality and representativeness of the 'small number of illustrative samples' used to define in-policy behavior. Its effectiveness might vary with the complexity or ambiguity of policy texts, and the generality of using Euclidean norm as a compliance score across all types of highly nuanced policy violations might warrant further investigation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.
