                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research investigates the complex, interconnected dynamics of disease surveillance, adaptive human behavior, information dissemination, and centralized public health interventions in shaping epidemic outcomes. It reveals that robust surveillance, while triggering early public response, can paradoxically lead to larger epidemic sizes, and that optimal containment relies on a precise trade-off between risk information flow and disease transmission, with behavioral adaptation inducing hysteresis.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical insights into the non-linear and often counter-intuitive ways human behavior and public health infrastructure interact during epidemics, offering a robust modeling framework to design more effective and adaptive disease control policies that account for complex feedback loops.</p>

                <p>While the paper itself does not explicitly use AI, its findings are highly relevant for informing and optimizing AI applications in health. For instance, AI could be used to build and refine the 'modern epidemiological modeling frameworks' mentioned, process and analyze real-time surveillance data to detect outbreaks faster, personalize risk information dissemination strategies, or optimize the deployment of interventions based on predicted behavioral responses. The insights on the trade-offs between information dissemination and disease transmission, mediated by surveillance, could guide the development of AI-driven public health communication systems and intervention planning tools.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work informs public health officials and clinicians on the critical importance of not just rapid disease detection, but also the strategic management of information dissemination and public communication during an outbreak. It suggests that immediate, robust surveillance without careful consideration of subsequent behavioral adaptations and information flow could lead to sub-optimal outcomes, necessitating dynamic and flexible intervention strategies beyond initial detection. Clinically, this impacts resource allocation and messaging for patient education and community engagement during epidemics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless, the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes. The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</p>
