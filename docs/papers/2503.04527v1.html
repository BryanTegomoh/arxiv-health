                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper examines the complex feedback dynamics between disease surveillance, adaptive human behavior, and public health interventions in epidemic containment. It reveals that robust surveillance, by triggering early decentralized behavioral responses, can counter-intuitively lead to larger final epidemic sizes. The study emphasizes that minimizing epidemic impact hinges on a crucial trade-off between risk information dissemination and disease transmission, mediated by the surveillance system's triggering effect.</p>

                <p>This research provides crucial insights for public health authorities and policymakers by demonstrating the complex, often non-linear, impact of surveillance and public communication on epidemic outcomes.

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Although the paper itself uses mathematical modeling (dynamical systems) rather than AI, the areas it investigates are prime candidates for AI applications in health. AI could be applied to enhance 'disease surveillance' systems (e.g., real-time outbreak detection from diverse data sources), to predict and model 'adaptive human behavior' more accurately, to optimize 'risk information dissemination' strategies, and to design and fine-tune 'centralized interventions' based on complex, dynamic feedback loops identified in such models. AI-driven predictive analytics could inform the 'trade-off between risk information dissemination and disease transmission' to minimize epidemic size.</p>

The scenarios that minimize epidemic impact are determined by a critical trade-off between the rate and effect of risk information dissemination and disease transmission dynamics, mediated by the surveillance system.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has significant practical implications for public health communication strategies, the design of early warning systems, and the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. It suggests that simply enhancing surveillance isn't enough; the timing and nature of information release, coupled with an understanding of anticipated public reactions, must be strategically managed to avoid unintended consequences (e.g., complacency or counterproductive behaviors). It advocates for dynamic response protocols that explicitly incorporate human behavioral feedback for more effective epidemic management.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless, the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes. The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</p>
