                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the complex interplay between disease surveillance, information dissemination, adaptive human behavior, and centralized public health interventions in epidemic containment. It reveals that robust surveillance, while triggering early population responses, can paradoxically lead to larger epidemic sizes, with optimal containment achieved by balancing risk information and disease transmission, mediated by surveillance. The study emphasizes the critical role of these feedback loops in designing effective control policies.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for public health policy and epidemic management as it reveals the complex, often counter-intuitive, interplay between surveillance, human behavior, and disease spread. It provides a more nuanced understanding for designing intervention strategies that account for these critical behavioral feedback loops, moving beyond purely epidemiological models to optimize containment.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself employs mathematical modeling (dynamical systems) rather than AI, its findings are highly relevant for informing AI applications in health. Insights into the trade-offs between risk information dissemination, disease transmission, and the triggering effect of surveillance could be integrated into AI-driven decision support systems for public health authorities. Such AI systems could be used for predictive modeling of epidemic trajectories, optimizing resource allocation for interventions, developing adaptive communication strategies, or simulating the impact of various policy choices on disease spread and population behavior.</p>

                <p>This research provides a framework for developing more sophisticated public health policies and communication strategies during epidemics, advocating for approaches beyond simply 'faster detection is always better.' It suggests that careful timing and content of risk information dissemination, alongside robust detection, are paramount for minimizing epidemic impact. Furthermore, it helps anticipate and mitigate potential unintended consequences of early interventions or information surges, potentially leading to improved public compliance and more efficient allocation of healthcare resources.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless, the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes. The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</p>
