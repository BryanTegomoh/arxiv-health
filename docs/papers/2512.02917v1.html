                    <p>A prospective clinical validation study was conducted on 258 patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT. Standard-of-care scans (100% counting statistics) were acquired and reconstructed per EARL standards 2.

Oncologic lesions were segmented, and evaluation included lesion detectability (sensitivity, false positives), quantitative performance of SUVmax (concordance, bias, 95% limits of agreement), and subjective image quality assessed by two experienced physicians.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Across 198 studies and 1649 lesions, 50%+PETfectior images achieved 99.9% sensitivity for lesion detection with only 1 false positive. SUVmax measurements between 100% and 50%+PETfectior images showed a low bias of -1.01% and agreed within 12.5% (95% limits of agreement). Subjective image quality of the PETfectior-processed low-count images was consistently rated as equal to or superior to the standard full-count images.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>PETfectior can fundamentally alter current PET imaging protocols by enabling accurate and high-quality diagnostics with half the standard radiopharmaceutical dose or acquisition time. This directly translates to reduced radiation burden for patients, lower operational costs for healthcare providers, and potentially shorter patient throughput times, making PET scans safer, more efficient, and more cost-effective in oncology.</p>

Future research could also investigate the long-term impact on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes, and potentially explore applicability to other PET radiotracers.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Diagnostic PET image quality depends on the administered activity and acquisition time. However, minimizing these variables is desirable to reduce patient radiation exposure and radiopharmaceutical costs. PETfectior is an artificial intelligence-based software that processes PET scans and increases signal-to-noise ratio, obtaining high-quality images from low-count-rate images. We perform an initial clinical validation of PETfectior on images acquired with half of the counting statistics required to meet the most recent EANM quantitative standards for 18F-FDG PET, evaluating lesions detectability, quantitative performance and image quality.
  Materials and methods: 258 patients referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT were prospectively included. The standard-of-care scans (100% scans) were acquired and reconstructed according to EARL standards 2. Half-counting-statistics versions were generated from list-mode data and processed with PETfecftior (50%+PETfectior scans). All oncologic lesions were segmented on both PET/CT versions, manually or automatically, and lesions detectability was evaluated. The SUVmax of the lesions was measured and the quantitative concordance of 50%+PETfectior and 100% images was evaluated. Subjective image quality was visually assessed by two experienced physicians.
  Results: 1649 lesions were detected in a total of 198 studies. The 50%+PETfectior images showed high sensitivity for lesion detection (99.9%) and only 1 false positive was detected. The SUVmax measured in 100% and 50%+PETfectior images agreed within 12.5% (95% limits of agreement), with a bias of -1.01%. Image quality of the 50%+PETfectior images was rated equal to or better than the standard-of-care images.
  Conclusion: PETfectior can safely be used in clinical practice at half counting statistics, with high sensitivity and specificity, low quantitative bias and high subjective image quality.</p>
