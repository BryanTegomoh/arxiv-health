                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated the feasibility of early cancer detection in dogs using machine learning on routine laboratory data, addressing challenges like non-specific biomarkers and severe class imbalance. While a statistically detectable cancer signal was found (AUROC=0.815), the optimal model demonstrated poor clinical classification performance (F1=0.25, PPV=0.15), indicating that routine lab data alone are insufficient for reliable early cancer diagnosis or rule-out.</p>

                    <p>A statistically detectable cancer signal was identified in routine lab data, achieving a moderate AUROC of 0.815 for the optimal model. However, clinical classification performance was poor (F1-score = 0.25, PPV = 0.15).

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This study establishes that routine laboratory data alone, despite their accessibility and low cost, are insufficient for clinically reliable early cancer detection or rule-out in dogs. While a high NPV is promising, the low recall and PPV mean that such a test would generate too many false positives to be clinically useful for diagnosis, and too many false negatives to confidently rule out disease. This guides future research towards multi-modal data integration rather than refining single-modality approaches.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation is the inherent non-specificity of individual biomarkers in routine laboratory data and the severe class imbalance in screening populations. The study also acknowledges that grouping diverse cancer types and including post-diagnosis samples in the dataset might have confounded the signal. The finding that the cancer signal is too weak and confounded by normal aging or other inflammatory conditions highlights a fundamental limitation of this data modality in isolation.</p>

This implies combining routine lab data with other information such as genetic markers, imaging data, advanced proteomics, or metabolomics to achieve clinically reliable cancer discrimination.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.</p>
