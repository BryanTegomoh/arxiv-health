                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated the feasibility of early cancer detection in dogs using routine laboratory data and machine learning, specifically on the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study cohort. While a moderate ranking ability was achieved (AUROC=0.815), the optimal model demonstrated poor clinical classification performance (F1=0.25, PPV=0.15) and insufficient recall for reliable rule-out, concluding that the cancer signal in such data is too weak and confounded for clinical utility in isolation. The work establishes a performance ceiling for this data modality and highlights the need for multi-modal data integration.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a comprehensive benchmark evaluation comparing 126 machine learning pipelines. These pipelines consisted of various ML models, feature selection methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination), and data balancing techniques (e.g., class weighting) applied to routine laboratory data from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort. Data were partitioned at the patient level to prevent leakage, and the analysis accounted for real-world constraints such as grouping diverse cancer types and including post-diagnosis samples.

                    <p>The optimal model, a Logistic Regression classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, achieved an AUROC of 0.815 (95% CI: 0.793-0.836), indicating moderate ranking ability. However, its clinical classification performance was poor, reflected by an F1-score of 0.25 and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 0.15. While a high Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 0.98 was achieved, insufficient recall (0.79) prevented its use as a reliable rule-out test.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The study's findings indicate that machine learning models built solely on routine laboratory data are currently insufficient for reliable early cancer detection or as a rule-out test in veterinary clinical practice, despite a statistically detectable signal. The poor clinical classification performance (low PPV, F1-score, and insufficient recall) highlights that these non-specific biomarkers cannot adequately discriminate early cancer from normal aging or inflammatory conditions. This sets a realistic performance ceiling for such single-modality approaches, informing veterinarians and researchers about the current limitations of these diagnostic tools.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation identified is that the cancer signal within routine laboratory data, even with advanced machine learning, is too weak and highly confounded. The predictive features identified by SHAP (age, inflammation, anemia markers) are non-specific, making it challenging for the model to reliably distinguish early cancer from common physiological changes or other inflammatory conditions. This inherent non-specificity limits the clinical utility of this data modality when used in isolation.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The study explicitly recommends that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology for early cancer detection will necessitate the integration of multi-modal data sources. This suggests combining routine laboratory data with other, more specific diagnostic information, such as advanced imaging, genetic markers, or specialized proteomic/metabolomic panels, to overcome the current limitations of non-specific biomarkers and achieve clinically reliable discrimination.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.</p>
