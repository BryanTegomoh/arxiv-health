                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated the feasibility of early cancer detection in dogs using machine learning on routine, low-cost laboratory data from an imbalanced dataset. It revealed that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists (AUROC = 0.815), the optimal model delivered poor clinical classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, PPV = 0.15) driven by non-specific markers, rendering it unsuitable for reliable diagnostic use in isolation. The work establishes a performance ceiling for this data modality and emphasizes the need for multi-modal data integration for future progress.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings demonstrate that current machine learning approaches using routine laboratory data alone are not clinically reliable for early cancer detection or as a rule-out test due to poor classification performance (low F1, low PPV) and insufficient recall despite high NPV. This establishes a critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation, indicating it cannot reliably differentiate early cancer from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, it is not suitable for practical veterinary screening or diagnostic applications in its current form.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.</p>
