                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical issue of inadequate validation practices in surgical AI development, which severely limits clinical adoption. It introduces the first comprehensive, expert-consensus-driven catalog of validation pitfalls in AI-based surgical video analysis, spanning data, metrics, and reporting. The study empirically demonstrates that current practices often neglect the temporal and hierarchical structure of surgical videos, leading to misleading results, and establishes a foundational framework for rigorous validation essential for safe clinical translation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Surgical data science (SDS) is rapidly advancing, yet clinical adoption of
artificial intelligence (AI) in surgery remains severely limited, with
inadequate validation emerging as a key obstacle. In fact, existing validation
practices often neglect the temporal and hierarchical structure of
intraoperative videos, producing misleading, unstable, or clinically irrelevant
results. In a pioneering, consensus-driven effort, we introduce the first
comprehensive catalog of validation pitfalls in AI-based surgical video
analysis that was derived from a multi-stage Delphi process with 91
international experts. The collected pitfalls span three categories: (1) data
(e.g., incomplete annotation, spurious correlations), (2) metric selection and
configuration (e.g., neglect of temporal stability, mismatch with clinical
needs), and (3) aggregation and reporting (e.g., clinically uninformative
aggregation, failure to account for frame dependencies in hierarchical data
structures). A systematic review of surgical AI papers reveals that these
pitfalls are widespread in current practice, with the majority of studies
failing to account for temporal dynamics or hierarchical data structure, or
relying on clinically uninformative metrics. Experiments on real surgical video
datasets provide the first empirical evidence that ignoring temporal and
hierarchical data structures can lead to drastic understatement of uncertainty,
obscure critical failure modes, and even alter algorithm rankings. This work
establishes a framework for the rigorous validation of surgical video analysis
algorithms, providing a foundation for safe clinical translation, benchmarking,
regulatory review, and future reporting standards in the field.</p>
