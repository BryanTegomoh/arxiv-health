                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel three-stage deep learning paradigm to overcome the "black box" nature of ECG classification models by transferring knowledge from multimodal clinical data (lab exams, vitals) into a unimodal ECG encoder. The approach creates an ECG representation enriched with contextual clinical information, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and providing physiologically grounded explanations through the prediction of associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a novel three-stage training paradigm. First, a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage is employed to create an ECG representation enriched with contextual clinical information derived from multimodal data (laboratory exams, vitals, biometrics). Second, the pre-trained ECG encoder is fine-tuned for multi-label diagnosis classification. Third, to improve interpretability and provide explanations, the model is simultaneously trained to predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding. A crucial aspect is that only the ECG signal is required during inference, making it practical for clinical deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models have shown high accuracy in classifying electrocardiograms (ECGs), but their black box nature hinders clinical adoption due to a lack of trust and interpretability. To address this, we propose a novel three-stage training paradigm that transfers knowledge from multimodal clinical data (laboratory exams, vitals, biometrics) into a powerful, yet unimodal, ECG encoder. We employ a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage to create an ECG representation that is enriched with contextual clinical information, while only requiring the ECG signal at inference time. Furthermore, as an indirect way to explain the model's output we train it to also predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding. Evaluated on the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset, our model outperforms a standard signal-only baseline in multi-label diagnosis classification and successfully bridges a substantial portion of the performance gap to a fully multimodal model that requires all data at inference. Our work demonstrates a practical and effective method for creating more accurate and trustworthy ECG classification models. By converting abstract predictions into physiologically grounded \emph{explanations}, our approach offers a promising path toward the safer integration of AI into clinical workflows.</p>
