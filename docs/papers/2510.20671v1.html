                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GRACE, a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework designed to predict the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients, a critical clinical decision often hindered by resource scarcity and data class imbalance. GRACE formalizes this as a structured learning problem, employing extensive feature engineering and a new unbiased meta-graph approach to address class imbalance. Experimental results on real-world data show a significant improvement of 11-35% in the F1 score for the minority class over existing baselines.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology centers on a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, GRACE, which reframes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. This involves extensive feature engineering to capture relevant patient and contextual information. A key innovative aspect is the development of a new approach to construct an unbiased meta-graph. This meta-graph is specifically designed to mitigate the severe class imbalance issues prevalent in real-world addiction datasets, allowing the GNN to learn robustly across all care categories, particularly for less represented patient groups.</p>

                <p>This research offers a potential paradigm shift in addiction care by providing an automated, data-driven tool to assist clinicians in making more precise and timely decisions regarding the appropriate locus of care. This could lead to optimized allocation of scarce resources (e.g., inpatient beds, specialized staff), improved patient outcomes through better care matching, reduced clinician burnout, and more equitable care by enhancing prediction accuracy for historically underserved or less common patient profiles.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.</p>
