                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GRACE, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, designed to automate the critical clinical decision of determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients. By formalizing this as a structured learning problem and employing extensive feature engineering with an unbiased meta-graph approach, GRACE effectively mitigates severe class imbalance in addiction datasets. The framework demonstrates significant improvements, achieving an 11-35% increase in the F1 score for the minority class over competitive baselines on real-world data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The GRACE framework utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to formalize the locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. This involves extensive feature engineering to create comprehensive patient representations. A key methodological innovation is the development of a novel approach to obtain an unbiased meta-graph, which is then used to train the GNN. This meta-graph construction is specifically designed to counteract the severe class imbalance typically found in addiction patient datasets, thereby improving the model's ability to learn from underrepresented classes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.</p>
