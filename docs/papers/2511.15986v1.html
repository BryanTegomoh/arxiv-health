                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical issue of fairness across demographic groups in medical image reasoning using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposing a novel tuning-free approach. The authors introduce Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which constructs demographically balanced and semantically relevant in-context learning demonstrations using clustering-based sampling. FADS is shown to consistently reduce gender, race, and ethnicity disparities on medical imaging benchmarks while maintaining high accuracy, offering a scalable solution for equitable medical AI.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Fairness in medical AI is paramount, as algorithmic bias can lead to unequal access to care, misdiagnosis, and poorer health outcomes for underrepresented demographic groups. This research directly addresses these disparities, aiming to build more equitable diagnostic tools that perform reliably across all patients, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology involves In-Context Learning (ICL) with a novel Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS) strategy. FADS utilizes clustering-based sampling to construct demonstrations that are both demographically balanced (addressing gender, race, ethnicity) and semantically relevant to the target task. This approach aims to guide MLLMs to make fairer predictions without requiring model fine-tuning or large auxiliary datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.</p>
