                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in medical image reasoning, but demographic fairness remains a critical concern. This paper introduces Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), a lightweight, tuning-free In-Context Learning (ICL) strategy that employs clustering-based sampling to create demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations. FADS consistently reduces gender, race, and ethnicity disparities across medical imaging benchmarks while maintaining strong diagnostic accuracy, presenting an efficient path towards equitable medical AI.</p>

                <p>Ensuring fairness in AI-powered medical diagnosis is paramount to prevent exacerbating existing healthcare disparities and guaranteeing equitable, high-quality care for all demographic groups, particularly when interpreting sensitive data like medical images.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the development and debiasing of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform more fair and accurate medical image reasoning and diagnosis. Specifically, it proposes a method (FADS) to ensure equitable performance of AI diagnostics across different demographic groups (gender, race, ethnicity) by creating balanced demonstration sets for in-context learning, thereby improving the reliability and fairness of AI-powered diagnostic tools in healthcare settings.</p>

                    <p>The proposed method, Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), is integrated into an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). FADS addresses demographic imbalance in conventional demonstration selection by using clustering-based sampling.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.</p>
