                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models, enabling adaptation to new domains without computationally expensive fine-tuning of large pretrained denoisers. GTL allows sampling from a target distribution via a ratio-based guidance mechanism, leaving the original denoiser untouched. Furthermore, an efficient guided sampler is presented to overcome the high computational cost of GTL, making it practical for large vocabularies and long sequences in applications like language modeling.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI method could enable more efficient and ethical development of AI models for healthcare. For instance, it could allow pre-trained generative AI models to be adapted to specific clinical datasets (e.g., rare disease narratives, electronic health records) without requiring the creation of new, large, and sensitive domain-specific training sets from scratch. It could also facilitate the generative design of novel drug candidates or therapeutic proteins by efficiently learning from limited biological sequence data.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on developing Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) by extending ratio-based guidance, previously used in continuous diffusion, to the discrete domain. This allows a pretrained discrete denoiser to generate samples guided by an external target distribution without modifying the denoiser's weights. To address the computational demands of such guidance, the authors engineered an efficient guided sampler that selectively evaluates guidance network passes, focusing on planner-selected positions and only the most probable candidate tokens, thereby reducing overall sampling time and computation.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology holds significant clinical impact by lowering the computational barrier for applying state-of-the-art generative AI in healthcare. It would allow healthcare institutions and researchers to leverage large, general-purpose discrete diffusion models (e.g., for language or sequences) for highly specialized medical tasks—such as generating realistic synthetic patient records for privacy-preserving research, customizing AI assistants for specific clinical workflows, accelerating drug discovery by designing novel molecular sequences, or analyzing complex genomic variations—using only smaller, domain-specific datasets and less computational power for adaptation. This could accelerate personalized medicine, improve diagnostic tools, and enhance the efficiency of biomedical research and development.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.</p>
