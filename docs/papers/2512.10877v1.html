                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models, enabling adaptation to new target distributions without computationally expensive fine-tuning of large pretrained denoisers. GTL employs a guidance formulation applicable to both discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion, which, combined with an efficient sampler, makes guided language modeling practical for large vocabularies and long sequences by concentrating evaluations on key positions and tokens.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Discrete diffusion models can generate complex discrete data pertinent to medicine (e.g., genetic sequences, protein structures, patient health records, medical codes). GTL offers a computationally efficient way to adapt these powerful generative models to specific medical tasks or datasets (e.g., rare diseases, specific patient cohorts) without needing to retrain massive models from scratch, which is critical given data sensitivity, scarcity, and computational constraints in healthcare.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology is Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models. GTL guides the sampling process of a *pretrained, unmodified* discrete denoiser towards a new target distribution. This guidance is achieved via a ratio-based formulation, unifying its application across different discrete diffusion frameworks (discrete-time and continuous-time score-based). To overcome computational intensity for large vocabularies and long sequences, an efficient guided sampler is introduced. This sampler intelligently selects specific positions and top candidate tokens for guidance network evaluations, significantly reducing the required forward passes.</p>

                    <p>The paper's key finding is the successful development and empirical validation of GTL, which enables effective transfer learning for discrete diffusion models without the need for computationally intensive denoiser fine-tuning. A significant discovery is the efficient guided sampler, which mitigates the computational burden of guided discrete diffusion, making it practically applicable for large-scale language modeling and similar sequence generation tasks involving extensive vocabularies and long sequences.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>GTL has the potential to dramatically lower the computational cost and data requirements for developing specialized AI applications in medicine. For instance, it could enable faster and more cost-effective generation of synthetic patient data for privacy-preserving research, accelerate the design of novel therapeutic sequences (e.g., peptides, RNA therapeutics), or quickly adapt large language models for highly specific medical coding, clinical note summarization, or diagnostic report generation tasks, even with limited amounts of highly specialized, domain-specific medical data. This improves accessibility and deployability of advanced AI in healthcare settings.</p>

While GTL addresses this with its efficient sampler, the abstract does not detail other potential limitations of GTL itself, such as performance bounds, specific types of target distributions it might struggle with, or empirical comparisons against other fine-tuning methods beyond mentioning their high cost.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.</p>
