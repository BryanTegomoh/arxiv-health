                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models, enabling adaptation to new target distributions without fine-tuning large pretrained denoisers. GTL provides a unified framework for both discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion, further enhanced by an efficient sampler that significantly reduces computational cost for practical large-scale language modeling. This approach addresses the challenge of high training costs and data scarcity for specialized domains by making transfer learning more efficient.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology revolves around Guided Transfer Learning (GTL), where a pretrained discrete denoiser generates samples guided by a separate network to align with a target distribution, without requiring any modification or fine-tuning of the original denoiser. This guidance is uniformly applicable across discrete-time and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion frameworks. To enhance efficiency, particularly for large vocabularies and long sequences, an optimized guided sampler is introduced. This sampler reduces computational overhead by strategically focusing evaluations on specific, planner-selected positions and a subset of top candidate tokens, rather than performing exhaustive computations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.</p>
