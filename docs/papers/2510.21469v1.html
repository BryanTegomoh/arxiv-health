                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Based on the abstract, the methodology appears to be conceptual and theoretical, presenting an argument for the fundamental nature of resilience in social robots and defining its importance, particularly in healthcare contexts. The paper 'shows how resilience is a fundamental characteristic,' suggesting a framework-building or persuasive reasoning approach rather than empirical experimentation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The central finding is the assertion that resilience is a fundamental and non-negotiable characteristic for social robots. This resilience directly underpins the ability of these robots to engender and maintain trust, which is identified as an essential prerequisite for their successful deployment, especially in high-stakes environments like elder care where trust levels are currently a significant barrier.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact lies in guiding the design and development of future healthcare robots. By emphasizing resilient AI, this work encourages the creation of more dependable, robust, and trustworthy social robots. This could lead to improved patient acceptance and compliance, safer care delivery for the elderly, and more effective assistive tools for healthcare professionals, ultimately enhancing the quality and accessibility of care.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract itself does not explicitly state limitations of the presented research. However, it implicitly highlights a broader challenge: the low trust of elderly people in robotic systems. The abstract does not provide details on specific architectural implementations for resilient AI, empirical validation of its impact on trust, or a comparison with alternative approaches.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, implied future directions would involve developing concrete, resilient AI architectures for social robots, conducting empirical studies to quantify the impact of resilience on trust and acceptance in diverse patient populations (especially the elderly), and exploring specific applications and ethical considerations of resilient social robots in various healthcare scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.</p>
