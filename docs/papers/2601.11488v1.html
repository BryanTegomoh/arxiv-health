                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces CTest-Metric, a novel unified framework designed to assess the clinical validity and robustness of metrics used for automated radiology report generation (RRG) in CT imaging. By evaluating eight common metrics across three modules focusing on writing style generalizability, synthetic error injection, and expert correlation, the study found that lexical metrics are sensitive to style, GREEN Score best correlates with expert judgments, and BERTScore-F1 is robust to factual errors. The framework aims to address the current reliance on suboptimal metrics by providing a systematic assessment tool.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>CTest-Metric is a unified framework with three modules. The **Writing Style Generalizability (WSG)** module assesses metric robustness to stylistic changes by rephrasing CT reports using LLM-based techniques. The **Synthetic Error Injection (SEI)** module evaluates metric sensitivity to factual errors by introducing errors of graded severities into reports. The **Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE)** module quantifies the agreement between metric scores and clinician ratings on 175 'disagreement' cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) were studied, utilizing seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder for report processing.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Lexical Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics demonstrate high sensitivity to stylistic variations in CT reports. The GREEN Score exhibits the strongest positive correlation (~0.70 Spearman) with expert clinical judgments, making it a reliable indicator of report quality. Conversely, CRG shows a negative correlation with expert assessments. BERTScore-F1 is identified as the least sensitive metric to synthetic factual error injection, indicating its robustness in identifying factual inaccuracies.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework provides a crucial tool for developers and clinicians to rigorously evaluate the quality assessment metrics for automated radiology report generation. By identifying metrics that align well with clinical judgment and are robust to errors and style variations, it will guide the creation of more clinically valid and reliable AI systems. This will lead to more accurate and trustworthy radiology reports, enhance diagnostic confidence, streamline radiologist workflows, and ultimately improve patient care and safety by reducing potential misinterpretations or errors in automated medical documentation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.</p>
