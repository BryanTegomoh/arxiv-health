                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A vast majority of mass spectrometry data remains uncharacterized, leaving
much of its biological and chemical information untapped. Recent advances in
machine learning have begun to address this gap, particularly for tasks such as
spectral identification in tandem mass spectrometry data. Here, we present the
latest generation of LSM-MS2, a large-scale deep learning foundation model
trained on millions of spectra to learn a semantic chemical space. LSM-MS2
achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral identification, improving on
existing methods by 30% in accuracy of identifying challenging isomeric
compounds, yielding 42% more correct identifications in complex biological
samples, and maintaining robustness under low-concentration conditions.
Furthermore, LSM-MS2 produces rich spectral embeddings that enable direct
biological interpretation from minimal downstream data, successfully
differentiating disease states and predicting clinical outcomes across diverse
translational applications.</p>
