                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in
drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through
complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs)
coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic
AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out
experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed
loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI
architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm
systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery,
including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol
generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end
decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work
to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI
systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations
demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability,
compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining
scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data
heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline
future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.</p>
