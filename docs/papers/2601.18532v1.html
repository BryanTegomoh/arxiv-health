                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel active learning framework for medical image segmentation, addressing the critical bottleneck of manual annotation. It proposes an embedding-based cold-start strategy using foundation models and clustering for diverse initial training, followed by an uncertainty and spatial diversity-guided sample selection. The method consistently improves segmentation accuracy, as measured by Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance, over baseline methods across various X-ray and MRI datasets, particularly in low-data regimes.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology comprises a two-stage active learning pipeline. The initial 'cold-start' phase selects a diverse and representative dataset by first extracting foundation model embeddings for all unlabeled samples. These embeddings are then clustered, with the number of clusters automatically determined, and samples are proportionally selected from each cluster. The subsequent active learning phase employs an uncertainty-based sampling strategy, which is enhanced by integrating spatial diversity to guide the selection of new samples for annotation. The framework is designed to be interpretable, allowing visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples.</p>

For Montgomery, the cold-start substantially improved Dice from 0.928 to 0.950 and reduced HD from 14.22 to 9.38 mm.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate segmentation annotations are critical for disease monitoring, yet manual labeling remains a major bottleneck due to the time and expertise required. Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm. Overall, the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in low-data regimes, improving segmentation accuracy.</p>
