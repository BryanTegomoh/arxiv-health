                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to mitigate diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups in medical tasks, specifically glaucoma diagnosis.

The GR-LoRA method achieved a 69% reduction in diagnostic accuracy disparities on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy, utilizing only 0.24% trainable parameters for practical deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.</p>
