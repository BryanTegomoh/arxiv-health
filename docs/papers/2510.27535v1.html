                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces a novel framework for Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS) generated by AI from patient-clinician conversations, aiming to capture patient preferences, values, and concerns beyond mere biology. Using a mixed-methods approach involving patient and clinician input, the research developed annotation guidelines and evaluated five open-source Large Language Models. While LLMs showed promise in completeness and fluency, human-generated PCS significantly outperformed them in correctness and true patient-centeredness.</p>

While LLMs demonstrated reasonable completeness and fluency (best few-shot ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683 by Llama-3.1-8B), they did not achieve human-level performance in correctness and, critically, in capturing the nuanced patient-centered information.</p>

                <p>The proposed PCS framework offers a crucial blueprint for developing AI tools that genuinely support patient-centered care in clinical settings. It highlights that current open-source LLMs, while promising, require significant advancement to accurately and consistently extract and synthesize complex patient values, preferences, and contextual information essential for comprehensive clinical decision-making and shared care planning. This research guides future AI development towards more empathetic and holistically beneficial clinical support systems.</p>

The study's focus on atrial fibrillation and a limited set of open-source LLMs suggests potential generalizability limitations to other medical conditions or more advanced proprietary models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.</p>
