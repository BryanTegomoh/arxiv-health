                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS) as a new standard for AI clinical summarization, aiming to capture patient values beyond biological data. Through a mixed-methods approach involving patient and clinician input, a framework was developed and used to evaluate open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing that while LLMs show promise in fluency, they currently fall short of human experts in correctness and patient-centeredness.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a mixed-methods design. Initially, qualitative data was gathered via semi-structured interviews with two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients, 8 clinicians) to define the scope and structure of Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS). These findings informed the creation of detailed annotation guidelines. Subsequently, eight clinicians used these guidelines to generate gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultation transcripts. Sixteen consultations were used for prompt refinement. Finally, five open-source LLMs were evaluated (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, Qwen3-8B) on 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Performance was assessed quantitatively using ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and qualitatively for completeness, fluency, correctness, and patient-centeredness.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Patient and Public Involvement groups identified crucial elements for PCS, with patients highlighting lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care values, and clinicians emphasizing concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional context. In LLM evaluation, Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L 0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673) showed the best zero-shot performance, while Llama-3.1-8B achieved the highest few-shot results (ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). However, a significant gap remains: while LLMs matched human experts in completeness and fluency, their summaries were inferior in correctness and patient-centeredness, with human-generated PCS consistently favored in these critical aspects.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Developing AI systems capable of generating PCS has the potential to transform clinical documentation by shifting focus from purely biomedical data to a more holistic patient narrative. This can enhance shared decision-making, improve care coordination, foster stronger patient-clinician relationships, and ultimately lead to care plans better aligned with individual patient needs and values, thereby contributing to better health outcomes.</p>

                <p>The primary limitation identified is that current open-source LLMs, despite showing promise in fluency and completeness, consistently underperform human experts in the crucial areas of correctness and patient-centeredness when generating Patient-Centered Summaries.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.</p>
