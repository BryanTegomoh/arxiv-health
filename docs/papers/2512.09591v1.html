                    <p>While multiple SSRL pre-training methods yield comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches for mortality and disease prediction tasks.

                <p>The findings suggest that contrastive learning could be a highly effective pre-training strategy for developing AI models capable of predicting severe clinical conditions and mortality directly from PSG data. This could enable clinicians to identify high-risk patients earlier, beyond routine sleep disorder diagnosis, and implement timely interventions. The release of the benchmark will also standardize future clinical AI development in sleep medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard test for sleep analysis, generates vast amounts of multimodal clinical data, presenting an opportunity to leverage self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) for pre-training foundation models to enhance sleep analysis. However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code.</p>
