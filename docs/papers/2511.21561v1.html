                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces the Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address challenges in clinical risk prediction from Electronic Health Records (EHR) due to temporal irregularity, varying sampling intervals, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies. The MSTAN effectively models long-term trends and short-term fluctuations by integrating a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms mainstream baselines across key performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.</p>
