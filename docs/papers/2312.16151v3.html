                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces RadDiag, a foundational transformer-based model for comprehensive 2D and 3D radiology image diagnosis across various modalities and anatomies. It leverages a novel large-scale, clinician-reviewed dataset, RP3D-DiagDS, compiled from publicly available online medical images to overcome data scarcity and privacy issues. RadDiag demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy (95.14% AUC internally) and state-of-the-art zero-shot or fine-tuned performance on external hospital datasets, showcasing the immense value of online medical data for developing generalist AI in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Developing a generalist radiology diagnosis system can greatly enhance clinical diagnostics. In this paper, we introduce RadDiag, a foundational model supporting 2D and 3D inputs across various modalities and anatomies, using a transformer-based fusion module for comprehensive disease diagnosis. Due to patient privacy concerns and the lack of large-scale radiology diagnosis datasets, we utilize high-quality, clinician-reviewed radiological images available online with diagnosis labels. Our dataset, RP3D-DiagDS, contains 40,936 cases with 195,010 scans covering 5,568 disorders (930 unique ICD-10-CM codes). Experimentally, our RadDiag achieves 95.14% AUC on internal evaluation with the knowledge-enhancement strategy. Additionally, RadDiag can be zero-shot applied or fine-tuned to external diagnosis datasets sourced from various hospitals, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In conclusion, we show that publicly shared medical data on the Internet is a tremendous and valuable resource that can potentially support building a generalist AI for healthcare.</p>
