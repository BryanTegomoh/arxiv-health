                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a critical framework for designing robust Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks by proactively identifying and mitigating non-visual biases that allow models to achieve high scores without genuine visual understanding. The authors propose a diagnostic principle where benchmark designers should actively try to "game" their own benchmarks using a "Test-set Stress-Test" (TsT) methodology and then debias them with "Iterative Bias Pruning" (IBP). Applying this framework, they uncover pervasive non-visual biases in several prominent MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating how their debiasing process leads to more reliable evaluations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for the development and reliable evaluation of MLLMs in healthcare, particularly in diagnostic imaging. If medical MLLMs can achieve high performance on benchmarks by exploiting textual cues or superficial patterns instead of genuinely interpreting complex visual medical data (e.g., MRI, X-ray), their perceived capabilities will be overstated, leading to potentially dangerous misdiagnoses or flawed clinical decision-making.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology comprises two main components: diagnostic and debiasing. For diagnosis, a "Test-set Stress-Test" (TsT) is employed, involving k-fold cross-validation fine-tuning of a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) on *only the non-visual, textual inputs* of a benchmark's test set. This process assigns a bias score $s(x)$ to each sample, quantifying its susceptibility to non-visual exploitation. This is complemented by a Random Forest model using hand-crafted features for rapid, interpretable bias auditing. For debiasing, an "Iterative Bias Pruning" (IBP) procedure systematically filters out samples identified with high bias scores from the benchmark's test set, creating a more robust version.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found pervasive non-visual biases across all four evaluated MLLM benchmarks (VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, VideoMME), indicating that models could often achieve good performance without strong visual understanding. The TsT methodology effectively identified and quantified these biases on a per-sample basis. Applying the IBP procedure, as demonstrated with VSI-Bench-Debiased, significantly reduced the benchmark's solvability through non-visual shortcuts and increased the performance gap between models with and without visual access, thereby making the benchmark a more accurate measure of visual comprehension.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By ensuring that medical MLLMs are evaluated on benchmarks requiring true visual understanding, this work fosters the development of more trustworthy AI diagnostic tools. This directly impacts patient safety by reducing the risk of clinical errors stemming from MLLMs that "guess" diagnoses based on textual priors (e.g., patient history in the prompt) rather than accurately interpreting medical images. It leads to more reliable AI models for critical applications like cancer detection, disease staging, and treatment planning, improving the quality and efficacy of AI-driven healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.</p>
