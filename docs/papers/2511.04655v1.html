                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research reveals that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can exploit non-visual shortcuts, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns to achieve high performance on benchmarks, even those meant to require strong visual understanding. The paper introduces a diagnostic framework, comprising a "Test-set Stress-Test" (TsT) and "Iterative Bias Pruning" (IBP), to systematically identify and mitigate these biases, creating more robust and truly vision-centric benchmarks.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>As MLLMs are increasingly deployed in healthcare for tasks like medical image analysis and diagnosis, biased benchmarks can lead to an inflated perception of model capabilities, potentially resulting in unreliable AI tools that lack genuine visual understanding crucial for accurate clinical decision-making and patient safety.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The methods proposed in this paper can be applied to design and validate robust benchmarks for medical AI models that process multimodal healthcare data (e.g., medical images alongside patient histories or clinical notes). By exposing and mitigating non-visual shortcuts, this research helps ensure that medical AI applications genuinely learn to interpret critical visual information, thereby enhancing their reliability, accuracy, and safety in clinical settings for tasks like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment recommendation.</p>

                <p>This methodology has the potential to significantly enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of AI systems in healthcare. By ensuring that MLLMs truly interpret complex visual medical data (e.g., radiology scans, pathology slides) rather than relying on superficial text cues or biases, it can lead to more accurate diagnostic aids, improved prognostic models, and safer AI-driven clinical decision support, ultimately benefiting patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations of this approach include the computational cost of fine-tuning powerful LLMs for every benchmark, the inherent biases or limitations of the LLM used for the stress test itself, and the potential subjectivity or incompleteness of hand-crafted features used for the Random Forest diagnostic. The method focuses on identifying known types of non-visual shortcuts, but might not be exhaustive for all possible exploitable patterns.</p>

Further research could focus on developing more efficient and automated methods for bias detection, exploring methods to actively generate truly unbiased samples rather than just pruning existing ones, and investigating how to prevent more sophisticated forms of shortcut learning in MLLMs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.</p>
