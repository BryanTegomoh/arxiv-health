                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ImageTalk, a novel multimodal Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system designed for people living with Motor Neuron Disease (plwMND) to overcome the limited vocabulary of traditional symbol-based AACs and the low communication rates of text entry solutions. By integrating image recognition and natural language generation, ImageTalk significantly enhances communication efficiency, demonstrating 95.6% keystroke savings, consistent performance, and high user satisfaction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">People living with Motor Neuron Disease (plwMND) frequently encounter speech and motor impairments that necessitate a reliance on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. This paper tackles the main challenge that traditional symbol-based AAC systems offer a limited vocabulary, while text entry solutions tend to exhibit low communication rates. To help plwMND articulate their needs about the system efficiently and effectively, we iteratively design and develop a novel multimodal text generation system called ImageTalk through a tailored proxy-user-based and an end-user-based design phase. The system demonstrates pronounced keystroke savings of 95.6%, coupled with consistent performance and high user satisfaction. We distill three design guidelines for AI-assisted text generation systems design and outline four user requirement levels tailored for AAC purposes, guiding future research in this field.</p>
