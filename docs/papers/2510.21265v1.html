                    <p>A randomized, single-blind, crossover study was conducted with 29 participants, comparing pulsed wave (PW) transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) against continuous wave (CW) tPBM and sham controls.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found that pulsed wave (PW) tPBM significantly enhanced global efficiency, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality within brain functional networks, specifically associated with EEG **microstate C**. This mode also increased the mean durations parameter of microstate C, achieving middle to large effect sizes and demonstrating superior effects compared to both sham and continuous wave (CW) tPBM. A support vector machine (SVM) model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, interpreted using kernel SHAP analysis, exhibited the best performance (AUC = 0.956) in identifying the PW mode. Significantly, 8 of the top-10 features contributing most to this classification were directly related to microstate C dynamics.</p>

                <p>These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why pulsed wave tPBM may be superior to continuous wave, offering a specific EEG microstate C biomarker to objectively track the neural effects of tPBM. This could enable clinicians to optimize tPBM protocols (e.g., pulse frequency, power, duration), tailor treatments to individual patient responses, and potentially enhance the efficacy of tPBM for various neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to more precise and personalized neuromodulation therapies.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, typical limitations for such a study would include a relatively small sample size (n=29), which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The study's focus on identifying a biomarker suggests that the underlying, deeper neural mechanisms of how tPBM induces these microstate changes are still not fully elucidated, as indicated by the abstract stating the neural mechanisms are 'still unknown'.</p>

Future directions should focus on utilizing this biomarker to develop and refine optimized tPBM protocols for specific neuropsychiatric disorders, potentially exploring adaptive and personalized stimulation strategies. Further research is also needed to fully elucidate the complex cellular and molecular neural mechanisms by which pulsed wave tPBM induces these observed microstate C-specific changes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy is an emerging, non-invasive
neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated considerable potential in the
field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have found that pulsed
wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its
neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the
development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study
including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and
continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was
utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain
functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of
microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning
algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed.
Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency,
local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain
functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle
to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous
wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis
function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated
the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and
found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C
contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG
microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate
C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may
serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.</p>
