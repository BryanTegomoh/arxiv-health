                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates using embedding-space data augmentation as a strategy to mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on Time Series Forecasting (TSF) models trained with sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It demonstrates that retraining models with strategically generated synthetic data, particularly through ZOO-PCA, substantially reduces the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by lowering the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio, all without compromising predictive performance on test data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.</p>
