                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel knowledge-enhanced multimodal transformer framework designed to overcome the limitations of general-domain vision-language models like CLIP in medical applications, specifically for diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis. By integrating retinal images, clinical text, and structured patient data through specialized encoders and a joint transformer, the model achieves superior cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art DR classification performance. The framework dramatically improves medical image-text retrieval accuracy and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed framework integrates three modalities via a multimodal transformer architecture. Retinal fundus images are processed by a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16), clinical narratives by Bio-ClinicalBERT, and structured demographic/clinical features by a multilayer perceptron. These modality-specific embeddings are then fused and jointly processed by a transformer with modality-specific embeddings. The model is trained using multiple objectives: contrastive losses to align representations across modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses to predict DR severity grades according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Performance was evaluated on the BRSET dataset and validated with zero-shot evaluation on DeepEyeNet.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.</p>
