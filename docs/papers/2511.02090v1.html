Its primary focus is on the reliability of the CT device for dose calculation, not on AI development or deployment.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To evaluate reliability of upright CT for proton dose calculation
and feasibility of a simplified phantom configuration for accelerated routine
QA. Methods: A calibration phantom was scanned on an upright CT following
consensus guidelines for 14 sessions/7 months. CT number repeatability was
assessed by standard deviation (SD). Stopping power ratio (SPR) look-up table
was derived. Phantom size dependency was assessed. The simplified phantom
configuration was scanned for 15 sessions/8 months. Repeatability was assessed.
CT numbers and SPR were compared with consensus configuration. Both
configurations were scanned on a recumbent CT to validate the findings. An
anthropomorphic phantom was scanned on upright and recumbent CT. Targets were
drawn mimicking spine and prostate tumor. Proton plans were developed using
pencil beam scanning techniques and robust optimization. Equivalence of dose
calculation were assessed via controlled comparisons. Results: Simplified
configuration measured all CT numbers in 1 scan vs 5 for consensus guidelines.
Upright CT demonstrated excellent longitudinal stability (inter- and
intrasession SD <4.9 HU and 1.6 HU, respectively). Size dependency was
identified with significant (p<.05) differences in CT numbers, propagated to
$\Delta$SPR <5.3%. Significant (p<.05) differences were found comparing upright
CT numbers measured by 2 configurations ($\Delta$SPR<2.6%). Recumbent CT showed
smaller $\Delta$SPR (<0.7%). Both dosimetric comparison showed local
differences (<8% of prescription dose) while clinical equivalence was found
with target coverage differences <0.2% and gamma pass rates=100% at 3 mm/3% for
all controlled comparison of different CT machines and phantom configurations.
Conclusions: The upright CT demonstrated reliability to support adaptive proton
therapy. The simplified configuration shows feasibility for rapid QA.</p>
