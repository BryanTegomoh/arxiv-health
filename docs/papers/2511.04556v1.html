                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study presents a Data-Driven Sparse Sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with the EPA-SWMM model, to optimize sensor placement and accurately reconstruct peak flowrates in urban stormwater systems using minimal resources. Applied to a real-world catchment, the framework demonstrated that only three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes could achieve high-accuracy flowrate reconstruction (NSE 0.92-0.95) and good robustness to measurement uncertainty, addressing a critical challenge in flood monitoring under practical constraints.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized the EPA-SWMM model to generate a comprehensive training dataset consisting of peak flowrate profiles across the stormwater network of the Woodland Avenue catchment.

                <p>The direct clinical impact of this engineering-focused research is not applicable. However, by providing a more efficient and accurate method for urban flood prediction and monitoring, this technology can indirectly enhance public health outcomes. It enables public health agencies and emergency services to proactively manage and mitigate health risks associated with floods, potentially reducing incidence of waterborne illnesses, injuries, and mental health impacts, and ensuring better continuity of healthcare services during flood events.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implicitly suggests limitations by noting that robustness to sensor failures is 'location-dependent' and 'improves with the number of sensors deployed,' indicating conditions under which performance may vary. The validation was performed against a simulated SWMM dataset rather than real-world sensor data, which might introduce discrepancies when applied in practice. The computational cost for SVD and QR factorization for very large networks is not explicitly discussed but could be a consideration.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.</p>
