                    <p>The study utilized a two-step data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework.

The representativeness and accuracy of the identified sensor nodes were then validated by comparing DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles against the original SWMM outputs, assessed using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE).</p>

                    <p>The DSS framework successfully identified optimal sensor placements that allowed for highly accurate peak flowrate reconstruction. Specifically, only three optimally placed sensors among 77 potential nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction performance with NSE values ranging from 0.92 to 0.95. The model also demonstrated good robustness to uncertainties in measurements and exhibited location-dependent robustness to sensor failures, with resilience improving as more sensors were deployed.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has an indirect but significant public health impact by enhancing the capacity for urban flood early warning and real-time control. Improved flood prediction can lead to timely evacuations, reduced exposure to contaminated floodwaters, minimized physical injuries, and decreased incidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases. This ultimately alleviates the burden on healthcare systems during and after extreme weather events and supports community resilience and health.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the DSS framework itself but rather the general challenges of resource constraints in flood monitoring. Implicitly, the reliance on a simulated SWMM dataset for training might not fully capture all real-world complexities and uncertainties. The robustness to sensor failures being 'location-dependent' also implies that specific sensor locations might be more critical or vulnerable than others.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.</p>
