                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>ContextGAN is built upon a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. It integrates a 'constraint matrix' that encodes both explicit (directly stated) and implicit (unstated but crucial) domain-specific rules. The discriminator component of the GAN is made 'context-aware,' meaning it evaluates the synthetic data generated by the generator not only for realism but also for adherence to these encoded domain constraints. Simultaneously, differential privacy mechanisms are embedded into the generation process to provide strong privacy guarantees, protecting sensitive details from the original dataset.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The widespread use of big data across sectors has raised major privacy concerns, especially when sensitive information is shared or analyzed. Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees.</p>
