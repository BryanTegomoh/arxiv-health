                    <p>The study adopted a temporal modelling approach by training a recurrent neural model.

                <p>This work has the potential to enhance clinical decision support by enabling earlier identification of paediatric patients at risk of impending renal function abnormalities. This could lead to more timely clinical interventions, closer patient monitoring, or adjustments in treatment strategies, ultimately improving management and outcomes for children with kidney disease.</p>

                <p>Explicitly stated as a 'pilot study' and relying on 'simple temporal representations,' which suggests the current model's scope and complexity are introductory. It focuses solely on predicting one specific outcome (abnormal serum creatinine within 30 days) rather than broader or more granular renal outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Paediatric kidney disease varies widely in its presentation and progression, which calls for continuous monitoring of renal function. Using electronic health records collected between 2019 and 2025 at Great Ormond Street Hospital, a leading UK paediatric hospital, we explored a temporal modelling approach that integrates longitudinal laboratory sequences with demographic information. A recurrent neural model trained on these data was used to predict whether a child would record an abnormal serum creatinine value within the following thirty days. Framed as a pilot study, this work provides an initial demonstration that simple temporal representations can capture useful patterns in routine paediatric data and lays the groundwork for future multimodal extensions using additional clinical signals and more detailed renal outcomes.</p>
