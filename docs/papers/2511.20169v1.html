                    <p>The paper's methodology involves aggregating 380 real-world categories from 49 existing datasets into ADNet, standardizing all images with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and adding structured text descriptions.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary key finding is the significant performance degradation of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when scaling from single-category evaluation (90.6% I-AUROC) to a multi-class setting across 380 categories (78.5% I-AUROC). The proposed Dinomaly-m model effectively mitigates this, achieving improved performance with 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating its superiority in large-scale anomaly detection.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has substantial clinical impact by paving the way for more generalizable and scalable AI diagnostic tools. A single AD foundation model trained on ADNet could potentially detect a wide array of anomalies across various medical imaging modalities (e.g., radiology, pathology) without requiring separate, specialized models for each. This would streamline diagnostic workflows, reduce development costs, facilitate earlier and more consistent detection of pathologies, and enhance quality control in medical image analysis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the ADNet benchmark or the Dinomaly-m model itself. However, the observed performance drop of state-of-the-art methods to 78.5% I-AUROC, even with Dinomaly-m's improvement to 83.2%, indicates that there is still significant room for advancements in multi-category anomaly detection. The specific types of medical anomalies or imaging modalities covered within the 'Medical domains' are not detailed, which could be a limitation for targeted clinical applications.</p>

This implies future research will focus on developing more advanced, robust, and truly generalizable AD models capable of handling the vast complexity and variability across a multitude of anomaly types and contexts, building upon this benchmark.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defects using normal-only training data. Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.
