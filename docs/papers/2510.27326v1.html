                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,
breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited
availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust
classification-based approaches is crucial for the future of early breast
cancer detection, particularly in applications such as large-scale screening.
In this write-up, we provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to the
challenge. We begin by detailing the underlying concept and foundational
assumptions that guided our work. We then describe the iterative development
process, highlighting the key stages of experimentation, evaluation, and
refinement that shaped the evolution of our solution. Finally, we present the
reasoning and evidence that informed the design choices behind our final
submission, with a focus on performance, robustness, and clinical relevance. We
release our full implementation publicly at
