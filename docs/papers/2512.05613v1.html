                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DistillFSS proposes a novel framework for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) that internalizes support-set knowledge into a lightweight student model via teacher-student distillation. This approach eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast and efficient inference while allowing rapid adaptation to novel classes and unseen domains. Evaluated on a new benchmark including medical imaging, DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, especially in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, with significant efficiency gains.</p>

                <p>This research can enable AI models to rapidly adapt and perform semantic segmentation tasks in medical imaging, even for rare diseases or novel pathologies where annotated data is extremely scarce. For example, it could be used for segmenting tumors, lesions, organs, or anatomical structures from medical scans (MRI, CT, X-ray, microscopy) with minimal training data, facilitating faster diagnosis, surgical guidance, and personalized treatment planning. Its lightweight and fast inference capabilities are crucial for integrating such AI tools into clinical workflows without significant computational overhead.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. A teacher model, presumably proficient in few-shot reasoning, distills its learned support-set knowledge into a lightweight student network. This process specifically internalizes the few-shot reasoning capabilities into a dedicated layer of the student model, allowing it to perform semantic segmentation effectively without requiring the actual support images during test-time inference. The framework also supports efficient scaling to larger support sets through combination with fine-tuning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) seeks to segment unknown classes in unseen domains using only a few annotated examples. This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains.
