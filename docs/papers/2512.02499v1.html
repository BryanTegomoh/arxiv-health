                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces COPE (Chain-Of-Thought Prediction Engine), an open-source large language model (LLM) framework leveraging a two-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach with LLaMA-3-8B models to predict 90-day functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from unstructured clinical notes. COPE demonstrated performance comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to other baselines, offering an accurate, interpretable, and privacy-preserving solution for clinical outcome prediction.</p>

                    <p>The study developed COPE, a two-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework utilizing sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models. The first LLaMA model was tasked with generating clinical reasoning from unstructured discharge summaries of 464 acute ischemic stroke patients. The second LLaMA model then used this reasoning to predict the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Performance was evaluated using MAE, +/-1 mRS accuracy, and exact accuracy, and compared against GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01, +/-1 mRS accuracy of 74.4%, and exact accuracy of 32.8%. These metrics were comparable to GPT-4.1 and demonstrated superior performance compared to ClinicalBERT (MAE 1.24), a traditional structured ML model (MAE 1.28), and a single-step LLM (MAE 1.20). Subgroup analyses indicated consistent performance across sex and age, although a slightly higher error rate was observed in predictions for older patients, those who underwent thrombectomy, and cases with longer clinical summaries.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>COPE offers an accurate, interpretable, lightweight, and privacy-preserving open-source tool for predicting 90-day functional outcomes in AIS patients directly from complex, unstructured clinical text. This could significantly enhance personalized prognostication, facilitate more informed discussions with patients and families, aid in resource planning, and potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of stroke care without relying on proprietary or resource-intensive commercial models.</p>

                <p>The abstract notes slightly higher prediction error rates for specific patient subgroups, including older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and cases with longer clinical summaries. This suggests potential areas where the model's generalizability or robustness might be less optimal and require further investigation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.</p>
