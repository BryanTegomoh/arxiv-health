                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an "evolution-based approach" for estimating population-level causal effects in networked systems where the exact interference (spillover) pathways are largely unobserved. Rather than recovering the network structure, the method characterizes how outcomes evolve across observation rounds in response to interventions, using a novel distributional difference-in-differences framework enabled by treatment randomization to compensate for missing network information.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant for understanding and evaluating public health interventions, behavioral health programs, and community-based clinical trials where health outcomes are influenced by social interactions and network effects, even when the exact social or physical contact networks are unknown.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>An AI system could utilize these evolution-based causal models to: 1) Predict the population-level impact of public health interventions (e.g., vaccination campaigns, health education programs) by accounting for social network interference and spillover effects. 2) Optimize resource allocation for interventions by identifying key nodes or 'influencers' within health networks to maximize positive outcomes. 3) Estimate the true causal effect of treatments or policies in complex healthcare environments where patient interactions, shared environments, or social contagion may bias standard analyses. 4) Model the spread of infectious diseases or biothreats and evaluate the effectiveness of counter-measures (e.g., contact tracing, targeted lockdowns) under various intervention strategies and network structures.</p>

                    <p>The paper introduces an evolution-based approach that examines how empirical outcome distributions change across observation rounds in response to interventions. It uses an "exposure-mapping perspective" to provide an axiomatic characterization, defining conditions for outcomes to follow low-dimensional recursive equations. This framework functions as a distributional analogue to difference-in-differences, exploiting parallel evolutionary patterns across treatment scenarios. Treatment randomization is leveraged to implicitly sample from hidden interference channels, facilitating learning about heterogeneous spillover effects.</p>

                    <p>The central finding is that population-level causal effects in networked systems with unobserved interference can be consistently estimated by characterizing the evolution of outcomes over time, circumventing the need to recover the exact network structure. Minimal structural conditions are identified for the existence of such evolution mappings that translate into low-dimensional recursive equations for outcome distributions. Furthermore, treatment randomization is found to be crucial not just for confounding control, but also for enabling consistent learning of heterogeneous spillover effects by implicitly sampling hidden interference channels.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research can significantly improve the design and evaluation of community-level health interventions, such as vaccination campaigns, health education programs, or chronic disease management initiatives. By providing a robust method to estimate causal effects in the presence of unobserved social contagion or influence, it enables policymakers and healthcare managers to more accurately predict intervention impacts, optimize resource allocation, and tailor strategies to account for complex social dynamics, ultimately leading to more effective public health outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.</p>
