                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes an evolution-based modeling approach to estimate population-level causal effects in networked systems where interference pathways are largely unobserved. It argues that precisely recovering the network structure is unnecessary; instead, characterizing how outcomes evolve across observation rounds in response to interventions, using low-dimensional recursive equations, suffices. This method offers a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences, leveraging treatment randomization to implicitly sample hidden interference channels and learn about heterogeneous spillover effects.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and public health as it provides a robust framework for evaluating interventions (e.g., drug trials, public health campaigns, behavioral interventions) in realistic settings where patients or communities interact, and treatment effects can spill over to unobserved contacts. It allows for causal inference even when the full network of interactions (e.g., social contacts, disease transmission routes, healthcare system pathways) is unknown, which is common in complex health systems.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The methods proposed could be integrated into AI systems for: 1) Designing and evaluating public health interventions (e.g., vaccination campaigns, health education) to accurately predict population-level impact and manage spillover effects. 2) Developing predictive models for disease outbreaks that account for network transmission and intervention interference. 3) Informing personalized medicine by considering how interventions for an individual might affect their social network and vice versa. 4) AI-driven health policy analysis, to simulate and assess the causal impact of policy changes across interconnected communities or healthcare systems.</p>

                    <li>Causal effect estimation in networked systems often faces the challenge of unobserved interference structures, meaning interventions on one unit spill over to others via unknown pathways.</li>
                    
                    <li>The paper's central premise is that identifying population-level causal effects does not require recovering the exact network structure, but rather characterizing how interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes over time.</li>
                    
                    <li>It introduces an 'evolution-based approach' that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, compensating for missing network information through an 'exposure-mapping perspective'.</li>
                    
                    <li>An axiomatic characterization is provided for conditions under which the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, identifying minimal structural requirements for the existence of such 'evolution mappings'.</li>
                    
                    <li>This approach is framed as a 'distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences (DiD)', which estimates counterfactual trajectories by exploiting parallel evolution patterns across different treatment scenarios rather than parallel paths for individual units.</li>
                    
                    <li>A key insight is that treatment randomization serves a dual purpose: beyond eliminating latent confounding, it induces an implicit sampling of hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects.</li>
                    
                    <li>The method is highlighted through instantiations like causal message passing in dense networks and extended to more general interference structures, including 'influencer networks' where a few units drive significant spillovers.</li>

                    <p>The methodology is an 'evolution-based approach' leveraging an 'exposure-mapping perspective'. It axiomatically characterizes conditions for outcomes to follow low-dimensional recursive equations, effectively tracking the evolution of outcome distributions over time in response to interventions. This is conceptualized as a 'distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences', comparing outcome evolution patterns across different treatment arms without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying network structure. Treatment randomization is exploited not just for confounding control, but also for implicitly sampling hidden interference channels.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The main findings are that population-level causal effects under interference can be consistently identified without full knowledge of the exact network structure by characterizing the evolution of outcomes over time. It establishes that, under minimal structural conditions, the empirical distribution of outcomes follows low-dimensional recursive equations. Crucially, treatment randomization is found to enable consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects by effectively sampling from hidden interference channels.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers a powerful tool for designing and evaluating public health interventions, such as vaccination campaigns, health education programs, or behavioral nudges, in interconnected populations. It enables health researchers and policymakers to estimate the true causal impact of interventions, including spillover effects, even when the exact social or physical networks through which these effects propagate are unobserved. This could lead to more efficient resource allocation, optimized intervention strategies, and a better understanding of disease transmission or health behavior change dynamics in real-world settings.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The approach has noted limitations. Its effectiveness can be undermined by the presence of strong temporal trends that are not attributable to the intervention, or by 'endogenous interference', where units' interactions or exposures are influenced by their treatment status or outcomes, violating the assumption of external interference. These conditions can confound the identification process, making it difficult to isolate the true causal effects.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.</p>
