                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes an evolution-based approach for estimating population-level causal effects in networked systems where intervention spillovers occur through unobserved interaction pathways. It argues that precisely recovering the network structure is unnecessary; instead, characterizing how outcomes evolve across observation rounds in response to interventions is sufficient, leveraging an exposure-mapping perspective to identify conditions for low-dimensional recursive outcome equations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant for evaluating interventions in healthcare, especially for public health campaigns, drug trials with patient interaction, or adoption of health behaviors where network effects, social influence, or patient-provider interactions lead to unobserved spillovers. It enables robust causal inference without needing a fully mapped interaction network, which is often infeasible in complex health systems.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper presents a novel methodological framework in machine learning (stat.ML, cs.LG) for robust causal inference. An AI system or application leveraging this methodology could: 
1.  **Evaluate Health Interventions:** Provide data-driven insights into the causal effects of public health campaigns, policy changes, or healthcare delivery strategies, accurately accounting for unobserved spillover effects within networked populations.
2.  **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Help decision-makers allocate resources more effectively for disease control, vaccine distribution, or health promotion by understanding how interventions propagate through communities, even without full knowledge of interaction networks.
3.  **Forecast Disease Spread:** Improve models for forecasting disease outbreaks and evaluating the impact of different containment strategies by incorporating the complex interplay of interventions and unobserved transmission pathways.
4.  **Personalized Medicine (Macro-level):** While not directly patient-level, it could inform group-level or community-level 'personalized' interventions by identifying and learning about heterogeneous spillover effects in specific demographic or social contexts.</p>

                    <p>The central finding is that identifying population-level causal effects under interference does not require recovering the exact network structure, but rather characterizing the evolution of outcomes. Minimal structural conditions are identified for the existence of low-dimensional recursive evolution mappings. Furthermore, treatment randomization is shown to be crucial for learning about heterogeneous spillover effects by implicitly sampling hidden interference channels, extending its traditional role beyond confounding control. The approach is versatile, applicable to both dense and influencer networks.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This approach offers a more robust and practical framework for evaluating healthcare interventions where direct and indirect effects are intertwined through unobserved social or physical networks, such as assessing the impact of vaccination campaigns, health education programs, or new treatment protocols within communities. It allows for valid causal conclusions even when detailed interaction data is unavailable, making evidence-based policy and clinical decision-making more feasible and reliable in real-world, complex settings.</p>

                <p>The identification of causal effects using this evolution-based approach can be undermined by the presence of strong temporal trends in outcomes that are independent of the intervention, or by endogenous interference, where units actively choose their exposure or interaction based on previous outcomes, violating assumptions about exogenous intervention.</p>

Further empirical applications across diverse medical contexts would also validate the practical utility of the framework.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.</p>
