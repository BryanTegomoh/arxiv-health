                <p>This methodology is highly relevant for medicine and public health by enabling robust evaluation of interventions (e.g., vaccine campaigns, health education programs, new drug rollouts) in patient communities or social networks where the precise interaction pathways influencing health outcomes are unknown, yet crucial for understanding population-level effects and spillover dynamics.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides advanced causal inference methodologies that can be integrated into AI systems for health applications. Specifically, AI systems leveraging these models could: 1) **Optimize Public Health Interventions:** Inform decision-making on where and how to apply interventions (e.g., vaccination drives, health communication campaigns) to maximize population-level health benefits, robustly accounting for complex, unobserved social interactions and spillover effects. 2) **Predict Disease Spread and Evolution:** Develop more accurate predictive AI models for infectious disease outbreaks by better understanding how interventions affect the dynamic evolution of disease outcomes in networked populations. 3) **Evaluate Health Policies:** Create AI tools that robustly assess the causal impact of new health policies or healthcare system changes, even when direct interaction data is unavailable or incomplete, thereby supporting evidence-based policy making.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology is an evolution-based approach that analyzes how empirical outcome distributions change across observation rounds in response to interventions. It uses an exposure-mapping perspective to axiomatically characterize low-dimensional recursive equations that describe the evolution of outcomes. This is conceptually aligned with a distributional difference-in-differences, exploiting parallel outcome evolution patterns across different treatment scenarios. Crucially, it leverages treatment randomization not just for confounding control, but also to induce an implicit sampling of unobserved interference channels, thereby allowing consistent estimation of heterogeneous spillover effects.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The central finding is that precise network structure recovery is not a prerequisite for identifying population-level causal effects under interference; instead, characterizing how interactions evolve outcomes over time via recursive equations is sufficient. It establishes the minimal structural conditions for such evolution mappings to exist. Furthermore, it demonstrates that treatment randomization serves a dual purpose, not only mitigating confounding but also enabling the consistent learning of heterogeneous spillover effects by sampling hidden interference mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has significant clinical and practical impact by offering a robust statistical framework for evaluating health interventions in complex, interconnected systems (e.g., communities, patient groups) without requiring complete knowledge of underlying social or contact networks. It can lead to more accurate assessments of public health campaigns, vaccine uptake dynamics, drug adherence programs, or behavioral interventions where patient-to-patient influence or environmental factors are present but unobservable. This allows for better evidence-based decision-making in designing and deploying health initiatives to maximize population-level benefits and mitigate unintended negative spillovers.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.</p>
