                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical imbalance in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) which are predominantly trained on high-resource languages, thereby limiting global healthcare access and equity. The authors introduce GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset spanning 12 languages (including low-resource ones), and GlobMed-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate existing LLMs across multilingual medical tasks. To overcome observed disparities, they developed GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements, particularly for low-resource languages.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study's key findings are that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant performance disparities across different languages in medical contexts, particularly struggling with low-resource languages. In contrast, the newly developed GlobMed-LLMs demonstrated substantial improvements, achieving an average performance increase of over 40% relative to baselines, and a remarkable greater than threefold performance increase specifically for low-resource languages, thereby bridging critical language gaps.</p>

                <p>The clinical impact of this work is profound, as it paves the way for deploying AI-powered medical tools that can understand and generate medical information in a wider array of languages. This could lead to improved diagnostics, enhanced patient education, better adherence to treatment protocols, and more efficient healthcare delivery for patients and providers in linguistically diverse regions, particularly where access to specialized medical expertise is limited due to language barriers.</p>

                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the limitations of *existing* LLMs (their training bias towards high-resource languages) which this research aims to address. It does not explicitly detail specific limitations or caveats of the developed GlobMed dataset, GlobMed-Bench, or GlobMed-LLMs within the provided text. However, the scope of 12 languages, while significant, still represents a subset of global linguistic diversity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite continuous advances in medical technology, the global distribution of health care resources remains uneven. The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances.</p>
