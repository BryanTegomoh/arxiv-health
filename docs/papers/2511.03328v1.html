                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is
the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their
internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode")
alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models
to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating
a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these
"dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning
processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical
tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two
leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We
assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and
ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the
thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for
the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as
open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,
highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced
methods for medical knowledge integration.</p>
