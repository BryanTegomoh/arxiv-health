                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces CNODE (Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework designed to forecast the continuous and individualized progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). It addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as recurrent neural networks and transformers, which struggle with irregular/sparse MRI data and the inherent patient heterogeneity in PD progression. CNODE leverages neural ordinary differential equations to model brain morphological changes as continuous temporal processes, enhancing individualized forecasting by learning patient-specific initial times and progression speeds.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.</p>
