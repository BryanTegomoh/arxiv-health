                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Food polysaccharides have emerged as suitable carriers of active substances
and as additives to food and nutraceutical formulations, showing potential to
stabilize bioactive compounds during the storage of microencapsulate
preparations, even in the gastrointestinal tract following the intake of
bioactive compounds, thereby improving their bioaccessibility and
bioavailability. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the main
polysaccharides employed as wall materials, including starch, maltodextrin,
alginate, pectin, inulin, chitosan, and gum arabic, and discusses how
structural interactions and physicochemical properties can benefit the
microencapsulation of polyphenols and pigments. The main findings and
principles of the major encapsulation techniques, including spray drying,
freeze drying, extrusion, emulsification, and coacervation, related to the
production of microparticles, were briefly described. Polysaccharides can
entrap hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds by physical interactions, forming
a barrier around the nucleus or binding to the bioactive compound.
Intermolecular binding between polysaccharides in the wall matrix, polyphenols,
and pigments in the nucleus can confer up to 90% of encapsulation efficiency,
governed mainly by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The mixture
of wall polysaccharides in the microparticles synthesis favors the
encapsulation solubility, storage stability, bioaccessibility, and bioactivity
of the microencapsulate compounds. Clinical trials on the bioefficacy of
polyphenols and pigments loaded in polysaccharide microparticles are scarce and
require further evidence to reinforce the use of this technology.</p>
