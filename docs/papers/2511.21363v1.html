                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric, a novel approach for efficiently and deterministically assessing the fidelity of local feature attribution methods to their underlying machine learning models. DPC modifies the existing Prediction Change metric by incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, achieving an almost tenfold speedup and eliminating randomness compared to Monte Carlo-based metrics like local Infidelity, while measuring the same property.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper proposes the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric by modifying the Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. This modification involves explicitly incorporating the direction of the perturbation applied to input features and the direction of the feature attribution itself. This directional guidance allows DPC to be computed deterministically, avoiding the need for Monte Carlo approximations. The method's effectiveness was validated by applying it to explanations from seven different algorithms, evaluated on two black-box models using a skin lesion image dataset and a financial tabular dataset, across a wide range of hyperparameters.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.</p>
