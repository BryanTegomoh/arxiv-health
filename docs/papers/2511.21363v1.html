                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Problem:** Existing fidelity metrics for local feature attribution (e.g., Infidelity) rely on Monte Carlo approximation, leading to high computational costs due to numerous model evaluations and introducing uncertainty from random sampling.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Solution:** The paper proposes the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric, which modifies the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Mechanism:** DPC incorporates the direction of both the applied perturbation to input features and the direction of the explanation's attribution, allowing for a more targeted and efficient assessment.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Benefits:** DPC achieves an almost tenfold speedup in evaluation, eliminates the randomness inherent in Monte Carlo methods, and results in a deterministic and trustworthy procedure for fidelity assessment.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Equivalence:** The proposed DPC metric is shown to measure the same property as local Infidelity, but with superior efficiency and reliability.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Evaluation:** The metric was rigorously evaluated on two distinct datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven different explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters, encompassing 4,744 distinct explanations.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Holistic Assessment:** The study concludes that DPC, when used in conjunction with PC, enables a comprehensive and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, providing reproducible outcomes.</li>

                    <p>The study introduces the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric by adapting the Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment framework. This adaptation specifically involves incorporating the direction of both the input feature perturbation and the attribution provided by the explanation method.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.</p>
