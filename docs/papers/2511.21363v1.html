                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric to efficiently and deterministically assess the fidelity of local feature attribution methods, which is crucial for trustworthy AI explanations in high-stakes medical settings. DPC modifies the existing Prediction Change metric by incorporating perturbation and attribution direction, achieving a nearly tenfold speedup and eliminating randomness compared to Monte Carlo methods like Infidelity, while measuring the same underlying property. This enables holistic, computationally efficient, and reproducible evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect an AI model's decision process for diagnosis and treatment. DPC provides a faster, deterministic, and trustworthy method to assess the fidelity of these explanations, which is critical for building confidence, ensuring patient safety, and facilitating regulatory approval of AI systems in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more efficient and trustworthy method for evaluating the fidelity of explainable AI (XAI) models. In healthcare, this is critical for building trust among clinicians and regulators, ensuring that AI explanations (e.g., why an AI model predicts a certain skin lesion is malignant) accurately reflect the underlying model's reasoning. This directly supports the development and responsible deployment of medical AI for tasks like diagnosis and prognosis, enabling better understanding, validation, and ultimately, safer and more effective use of AI in clinical settings.</p>

                    <p>The authors propose the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric, which modifies the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric by incorporating the direction of both the applied feature perturbation and the local feature attribution scores.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.</p>
