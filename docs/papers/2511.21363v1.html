                <p>This research develops a method to efficiently and reliably assess the fidelity of explainable AI (XAI) techniques used in healthcare. This is crucial for building trust and ensuring the accuracy of AI models in medical applications such as disease diagnosis (e.g., skin cancer detection from images), prognosis, and personalized treatment recommendations. By ensuring explanations faithfully reflect the model's decision process, it supports clinicians in making informed decisions and regulators in validating AI systems for medical use.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.</p>
