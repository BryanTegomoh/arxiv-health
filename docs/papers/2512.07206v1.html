                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The AutoLugano system employs a three-module sequential pipeline. First, a 3D nnU-Net model, trained on multi-channel FDG-PET/CT inputs, performs Anatomy-Informed Lesion Segmentation for automated lesion detection. Second, an Atlas-based Anatomical Localization module uses the TotalSegmentator toolkit and deterministic anatomical rules to map segmented lesions to 21 predefined lymph node regions. Third, the Automated Lugano Staging module translates the spatial distribution of involved regions into Lugano stages and corresponding therapeutic groups (Limited vs. Advanced Stage). The system was developed using the autoPET dataset (n=1,007) and validated on an independent external cohort (n=67), with performance assessed via accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To develop a fully automated deep learning system, AutoLugano, for end-to-end lymphoma classification by performing lesion segmentation, anatomical localization, and automated Lugano staging from baseline FDG-PET/CT scans. Methods: The AutoLugano system processes baseline FDG-PET/CT scans through three sequential modules:(1) Anatomy-Informed Lesion Segmentation, a 3D nnU-Net model, trained on multi-channel inputs, performs automated lesion detection (2) Atlas-based Anatomical Localization, which leverages the TotalSegmentator toolkit to map segmented lesions to 21 predefined lymph node regions using deterministic anatomical rules; and (3) Automated Lugano Staging, where the spatial distribution of involved regions is translated into Lugano stages and therapeutic groups (Limited vs. Advanced Stage).The system was trained on the public autoPET dataset (n=1,007) and externally validated on an independent cohort of 67 patients. Performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-scorefor regional involvement detection and staging agreement. Results: On the external validation set, the proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.31%, sensitivity of 74.47%, Specificity of 94.21% and an F1-score of 80.80% for regional involvement detection,outperforming baseline models. Most notably, for the critical clinical task of therapeutic stratification (Limited vs. Advanced Stage), the system achieved a high accuracy of 85.07%, with a specificity of 90.48% and a sensitivity of 82.61%.Conclusion: AutoLugano represents the first fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that translates a single baseline FDG-PET/CT scan into a complete Lugano stage. This study demonstrates its strong potential to assist in initial staging, treatment stratification, and supporting clinical decision-making.</p>
