                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a robust intervention for infectious disease control based on repeated, population-scale testing and isolation of infected individuals. Through rigorous analysis and simulations, the authors demonstrate that a sufficient testing rate can reduce the effective reproduction number (R_e) below 1.0, leading to rapid epidemic collapse, independent of strong assumptions about test accuracy or compliance. This strategy offers a rapid response to emerging pathogens, complementing traditional pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a crucial non-pharmaceutical strategy for rapid control of emerging infectious diseases, particularly when vaccines or specific drugs are unavailable or in development. It offers a scalable and robust public health framework for epidemic suppression, directly impacting pandemic preparedness and response.</p>

                <p>The paper describes rigorous analysis and simulations of epidemiological models. While AI/machine learning techniques can be used in complex epidemiological modeling and data analysis (e.g., predicting spread, optimizing testing strategies), this abstract does not explicitly state the use of AI as part of its methodology or proposed application.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Major advances in public health have resulted from disease prevention. However, prevention of a new infectious disease by vaccination or pharmaceuticals is made difficult by the slow process of vaccine and drug development. We propose an additional intervention that allows rapid control of emerging infectious diseases, and can also be used to eradicate diseases that rely almost exclusively on human-to-human transmission. The intervention is based on (1) testing every individual for the disease, (2) repeatedly, and (3) isolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of testing, the reproduction number is reduced below 1.0 and the epidemic will rapidly collapse. The approach does not rely on strong or unrealistic assumptions about test accuracy, isolation compliance, population structure or epidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored in real time by following the test positivity rate. In addition to the compliance rate and false negatives, the required rate of testing depends on the design of the testing regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling. Provided that results are obtained rapidly, the test frequency required to suppress an epidemic is monotonic and near-linear with respect to R0, the infectious period, and the fraction of susceptible individuals. The testing regime is effective against both early phase and established epidemics, and additive to other interventions (e.g. contact tracing and social distancing). It is also robust to failure: any rate of testing reduces the number of infections, improving both public health and economic conditions. These conclusions are based on rigorous analysis and simulations of appropriate epidemiological models. A mass-produced, disposable test that could be used at home would be ideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests that return immediate results.</p>
