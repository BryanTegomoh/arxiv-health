                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel sequence-level optimization framework to generate physically realistic, printable adversarial textures for common clothing items (shirts, trousers, hats) that enable robust human-detection evasion. The generated garments maintain concealment throughout entire walking videos, demonstrating high stability, robustness to viewpoint changes, and cross-model transferability in both digital simulations and real-world physical settings.</p>

                <p>The findings underscore the critical need for healthcare institutions and technology developers to consider adversarial robustness when deploying AI-based vision systems for security, patient safety, or asset management. It implies that current surveillance systems in clinics, hospitals, or elder care facilities could be vulnerable to sophisticated evasion techniques, potentially leading to unauthorized access, compromised patient privacy, or failed monitoring of vulnerable individuals. This research should spur the development of more resilient AI detection systems and robust security protocols in clinical environments.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While effective, the current approach focuses on specific garment types (shirts, trousers, hats) and a particular type of motion (walking videos). It represents an attack strategy, highlighting a vulnerability, rather than offering a direct solution for defense. The complexity and specificity of generating these textures might also limit their widespread 'casual' adoption without specialized printing capabilities. The generalizability to other complex human activities or environmental conditions beyond those simulated needs further exploration.</p>

                <p>Future research could focus on developing countermeasures and more robust AI detection models resistant to such adversarial attacks. Expanding the framework to cover a wider range of garment types, human activities, and environmental conditions would enhance its real-world applicability. Investigating the ethical implications and potential misuse of such technology, particularly within sensitive sectors like healthcare, is also crucial. Developing methods to detect the presence of adversarial clothing could also be a relevant research direction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.</p>
