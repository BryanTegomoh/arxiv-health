                    <p>The survey establishes two distinct Agentic AI paradigms: Symbolic/Classical, characterized by algorithmic planning and persistent state, and Neural/Generative, relying on stochastic generation and prompt-driven orchestration. It found that the choice of paradigm is application-driven, with symbolic systems being dominant and preferred in safety-critical domains such as healthcare due to their inherent reliability and explainability.

It supports the strategic selection of AI architectures, advocating for symbolic or hybrid systems where patient safety, explainability, and regulatory compliance are essential (e.g., diagnostic tools, treatment recommendations, drug administration). This can lead to more reliable and trustworthy AI-powered medical devices and decision support systems, improving patient outcomes and clinician confidence.</p>

There is also a pressing need to address the significant deficit in governance models for symbolic Agentic AI.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.</p>
