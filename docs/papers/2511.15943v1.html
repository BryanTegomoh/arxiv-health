                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to enhance visual understanding in complex domains like medical imaging. It addresses the limitations of existing models like CLIP, which struggle with multi-label and multi-granularity alignment, by integrating structured multi-label supervision, cross-granularity textual descriptions, and soft-label supervision. MGLL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream medical tasks, improving the alignment of visual and textual representations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.
