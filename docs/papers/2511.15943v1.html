                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a novel contrastive learning framework designed to enhance visual understanding in complex medical imaging by addressing the limitations of existing methods like CLIP. MGLL specifically improves multi-label and cross-granularity alignment, integrating diverse textual descriptions and structured supervision to accurately interpret medical images with multiple diagnoses and varying levels of detail. Pretrained on large-scale multi-granular datasets, MGLL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream medical tasks.</p>

                    <p>The paper proposes Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework that extends upon vision-language models.

                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the limitations of prior work (CLIP) that MGLL aims to overcome, rather than explicitly stating limitations of the MGLL framework itself. Common potential limitations for such models, not explicitly mentioned but implied, could include generalizability to extremely rare medical conditions, performance on highly noisy or low-quality data, and the need for large-scale, carefully curated multi-granular datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.
