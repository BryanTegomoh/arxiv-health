                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the trustworthiness of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), a common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality, particularly when applied to medical images. It addresses the known limitation that FID, relying on an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 model, is less effective for medical data due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. The authors propose using Monte Carlo dropout to estimate predictive variances in both the FID score and the underlying feature embeddings, demonstrating that these variances correlate with the OOD nature of the input data, thereby offering an indicator of FID's reliability.</p>

                    <li>The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is a widely used metric for assessing synthetic image quality, particularly in medical deep learning applications.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilizes Monte Carlo dropout to estimate the predictive uncertainty in deep learning models. Specifically, it computes two measures of predictive variance: one for the overall Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score and another for the latent feature embeddings generated by the InceptionV3 model. These variances are evaluated against various test inputs, including the ImageNet1K validation set augmented at different strengths to simulate varying degrees of distribution shift, and other unspecified external datasets, to determine their correlation with the out-of-distribution nature of the data.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that the magnitudes of the predictive variances (both in the FID score and the InceptionV3's latent feature embeddings) exhibit a measurable correlation with the extent to which test inputs are out-of-distribution relative to the model's training data. This suggests that these computed variances can effectively indicate the trustworthiness or reliability of the FID metric, especially when applied to novel or domain-shifted datasets like medical images.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By providing a method to quantify the trustworthiness of FID for medical imaging, this research can lead to more reliable assessment of generative models used in medical AI. This means improved confidence in the quality of synthetic medical datasets for training, validating, and augmenting models, potentially leading to more accurate diagnoses, better treatment planning tools, and safer deployment of AI in clinical settings. It could guide researchers in understanding when FID scores for medical images are truly meaningful versus when they are likely unreliable.</p>

                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the known limitation of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) itself—its reduced effectiveness for medical images due to the underlying InceptionV3 model being pretrained on natural images (ImageNet1K) and the medical data being out-of-distribution. The paper investigates the extent of this limitation rather than stating limitations of its own methodology in the abstract.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.</p>
