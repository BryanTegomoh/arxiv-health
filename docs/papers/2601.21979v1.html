                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the trustworthiness of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for evaluating the quality of synthetic medical images, a metric often considered less effective for this domain due to its reliance on models trained on natural images. The authors utilize Monte Carlo dropout to compute predictive variances in both FID and the underlying feature embeddings, demonstrating a correlation between these variances and the 'out-of-distribution' nature of test inputs. This correlation provides a means to assess the reliability of FID scores in contexts where the feature extractor is mismatched with the data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study's methodology centers on using Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO) during inference to generate multiple stochastic latent representations from the InceptionV3 feature extractor. From these representations, the predictive variance of both the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and the latent embeddings themselves is computed. These variance estimates are then correlated with the 'out-of-distribution' (OOD) nature of various test datasets, including augmented ImageNet1K validation sets and external datasets, to determine their utility as indicators of FID's trustworthiness relative to the InceptionV3 model's original training data.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The main finding is that the magnitudes of the predictive variances, both for the FID score and the underlying feature embedding model's latent representations, exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs are out-of-distribution relative to the InceptionV3 model's training data. This indicates that these variance measures can effectively serve as indicators of the trustworthiness and reliability of the FID metric, especially when applied to data domains (like medical images) that differ significantly from the feature extractor's training set.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has significant potential clinical impact by enabling more robust and reliable evaluation of synthetic medical images. Clinicians and AI developers can use these variance-based trustworthiness indicators to better interpret FID scores, identifying when the metric might be misleading due to domain mismatch. This improved understanding can lead to the development of higher-quality synthetic medical datasets for training diagnostic AI, reducing the risks associated with deploying models validated on untrustworthy quality metrics and ultimately enhancing patient care.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract highlights the inherent limitation that the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is less effective for medical images due to its reliance on an InceptionV3 model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet1K). The extent of this failure to capture meaningful differences in medical image characteristics is not easily quantifiable. While the paper proposes a method to evaluate the trustworthiness *of* FID, it does not inherently resolve this fundamental domain mismatch.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.</p>
