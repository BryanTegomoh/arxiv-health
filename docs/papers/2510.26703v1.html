                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build
high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate
cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in
clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa
detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:
ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt
encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective
evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable
heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results
highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and
interpretable alternative to expert-driven protocols.</p>
