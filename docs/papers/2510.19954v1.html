                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces RELATE, a schema-agnostic Perceiver encoder designed for multimodal relational graphs, specifically addressing the scalability and parameter sharing limitations of existing schema-specific GNNs in domains like healthcare. RELATE utilizes shared modality-specific encoders for diverse attributes (categorical, numerical, textual, temporal) and a Perceiver-style cross-attention module to generate fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representations. It achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while drastically reducing parameter counts by up to 5x, enabling multi-dataset pretraining and paving the way for foundation models for relational graph data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and health as it provides a scalable and efficient framework for processing complex, heterogeneous, and temporal multi-table data prevalent in healthcare, such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), genomic data, and clinical trial results. By offering a schema-agnostic approach, it simplifies the application of advanced AI models across diverse and evolving medical datasets without requiring extensive re-engineering for each specific schema.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>RELATE would serve as a core component for AI systems, specifically Graph Neural Networks, tasked with analyzing complex, relational, and multimodal healthcare data. For instance, it could be used to encode heterogeneous patient data from EHRs (including demographics, lab tests, clinical notes, and treatment histories) into a unified representation for tasks like predicting disease risk, identifying optimal treatment pathways, analyzing patient journeys, or discovering patterns in large-scale clinical databases. Its 'schema-agnostic' nature and potential for 'multi-dataset pretraining' would be highly beneficial for building generalizable AI models across diverse healthcare providers and datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>RELATE employs a two-stage encoding process. First, it uses shared, modality-specific encoders (e.g., for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal data) to transform raw node attributes into initial feature vectors. Second, a Perceiver-style cross-attention module takes these diverse modality-specific features and aggregates them into a single, fixed-size, permutation-invariant latent representation for each node. This design ensures the encoder is schema-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose GNN.</p>

                    <p>RELATE achieved a performance level comparable to schema-specific encoders, operating within a 3% margin, when evaluated on the RelBench benchmark. More critically, it accomplished this while significantly reducing the model's parameter count by up to 5 times, demonstrating a substantial improvement in efficiency and scalability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>RELATE's ability to efficiently process complex, heterogeneous medical data with reduced parameter counts could significantly impact clinical practice and research. It could accelerate the development and deployment of more robust and generalizable AI models for tasks like disease prediction, treatment recommendation, and patient risk stratification from EHRs. Its schema-agnostic nature would allow easier adaptation of models to different hospital systems or research datasets, potentially leading to more widespread and equitable AI integration in healthcare, reducing development costs and time.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, the finding that RELATE performs 'within 3%' of schema-specific encoders implies a minor performance trade-off for its significant advantages in schema agnosticism and parameter efficiency. This minor delta might be acceptable or even negligible given the substantial benefits in scalability and generalizability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p>
