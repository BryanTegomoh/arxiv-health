                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">RELATE introduces a schema-agnostic Perceiver encoder designed for multimodal relational graph data, addressing the scalability issues of existing GNNs that use schema-specific feature encoders. It leverages shared modality-specific encoders and a Perceiver-style cross-attention module to generate fixed-size node representations. Evaluated on RelBench, RELATE achieves performance comparable to schema-specific encoders (within 3%) while drastically reducing parameter counts by up to 5x, facilitating multi-dataset pretraining and foundation models for relational graph analysis.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>RELATE's methodology involves a two-stage encoding process. First, it utilizes shared, modality-specific encoders to process heterogeneous attributes (categorical, numerical, textual, temporal) independently across all features and node types. Second, a Perceiver-style cross-attention module aggregates these diverse, modality-specific feature embeddings into a single fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. This entire encoder acts as a plug-and-play module for general-purpose GNNs, evaluated for performance and parameter efficiency on established benchmarks like RelBench.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p>
