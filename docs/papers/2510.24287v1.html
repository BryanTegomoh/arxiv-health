                <p class="summary-text">This research develops an XGBoost machine learning model to predict the initiation of catecholamine therapy in critically ill ICU patients, offering a more clinically actionable target than traditional fixed MAP threshold predictions. Utilizing the MIMIC-III database, the model achieved a high AUROC of 0.822, significantly outperforming a MAP < 65 mmHg baseline, by integrating MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics to provide proactive decision support. This approach marks a shift towards predictive tools that align with actual clinical decision-making for hypotension management.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a framework for a more sophisticated, actionable clinical decision support system in the ICU. By predicting the need for catecholamine initiation, it can empower clinicians to proactively intervene, potentially reducing the incidence of severe hypotension and its associated complications, while also avoiding unnecessary or premature initiation of powerful vasopressors. This shift from reactive alarms to predictive, context-aware guidance could lead to optimized patient management and improved clinical outcomes in critical care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.</p>
