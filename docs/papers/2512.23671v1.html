                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT), an online method designed to guarantee calibrated quantile forecasts simultaneously across multiple levels. MultiQT wraps existing forecasters to produce corrected, ordered forecasts that maintain calibration even under adversarial distribution shifts, while also offering a no-regret guarantee against quantile loss. The method significantly improves calibration in real-world applications like epidemic forecasting.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper proposes Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT), an online, wrapper-based algorithm. MultiQT operates by taking the output of any base point or quantile forecaster and adaptively adjusting it. This adjustment process ensures that the resulting multi-level quantile forecasts are both properly calibrated (meaning the forecasts' coverage matches the nominal quantile level) and correctly ordered (monotonic across quantiles), even when the underlying data distribution changes adversarially. The method is designed with an online learning framework, continuously correcting forecasts, and is theoretically backed by a no-regret guarantee for quantile loss.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>MultiQT significantly enhances the calibration of existing forecasters, as empirically shown in real-world epidemic and energy forecasting applications. It effectively produces quantile forecasts that are both properly calibrated (i.e., forecasts are larger than the target at the specified $\alpha$-fraction of time) and correctly ordered across multiple quantile levels, without asymptotically degrading the underlying forecaster's performance relative to the quantile loss.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This method can lead to more reliable and trustworthy forecasts for critical medical and public health scenarios. For instance, in epidemic forecasting, it could provide significantly better and more robust estimates of future case counts, hospitalization rates, or intensive care unit (ICU) bed needs, including their associated uncertainty ranges. This allows public health officials and healthcare administrators to make more informed decisions regarding interventions, vaccine distribution, healthcare staffing, and resource allocation, ultimately improving patient outcomes, reducing disease spread, and optimizing public health response strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.</p>
