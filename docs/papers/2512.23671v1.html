                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT), an online method that guarantees simultaneous calibration of multi-level quantile forecasts from any existing forecaster. MultiQT corrects forecasts to ensure they are ordered and calibrated, even under adversarial distribution shifts, and comes with a no-regret guarantee. The method significantly improves forecast calibration in real-world applications, notably in epidemic and energy forecasting.</p>

                    <li>MultiQT is an online, lightweight wrapper method designed to correct and calibrate multi-level quantile forecasts from any existing point or quantile forecaster.</li>
                    
                    <li>It guarantees simultaneous calibration, meaning $α$-level forecasts are larger than the true value an $α$ fraction of the time, across multiple quantile levels.</li>
                    
                    <li>The method ensures that corrected quantile forecasts are consistently ordered (e.g., the 0.5-level forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast).</li>
                    
                    <li>MultiQT is robust against adversarial distribution shifts, ensuring its calibration guarantees remain valid even in dynamic and unpredictable environments.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MultiQT is an online, adaptive algorithm that functions as a wrapper around any pre-existing point or quantile forecaster. It continuously monitors the calibration of the input forecasts across multiple quantile levels and applies real-time corrections to ensure that the output forecasts are both calibrated and monotonically ordered (e.g., higher quantiles predict higher values). The method is designed to be robust against dynamic, even adversarial, changes in data distribution.</p>

                    <p>The paper introduces MultiQT, an online method that guarantees simultaneous calibration of multi-level quantile forecasts while preserving their ordering. It demonstrates that MultiQT offers robustness against adversarial distribution shifts and comes with a no-regret guarantee, ensuring asymptotic performance parity or improvement in terms of quantile loss. Crucially, empirical evaluations show MultiQT significantly enhances the calibration of real forecasters, particularly in critical domains like epidemic forecasting.</p>

                <p>This method can significantly improve the trustworthiness and actionable insights derived from predictive models used in public health. By providing reliably calibrated and ordered quantile forecasts, it enhances the ability of healthcare systems and policymakers to accurately communicate risks, allocate critical resources (like hospital capacity, medical supplies, and vaccination efforts) more effectively, and make timely, evidence-based decisions during disease outbreaks or other health emergencies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.</p>
