                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MedTutor-R1, a novel multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education, addressing the scarcity of expert instruction and the need for collaborative reasoning skills. Utilizing a multi-agent pedagogical simulator (ClinEdu) and a specialized Socratic teaching dialogue dataset (ClinTeach), MedTutor-R1 is instruction-tuned and then optimized with reinforcement learning using a three-axis rubric for adaptive strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that MedTutor-R1 significantly outperforms base models, achieving over 20% higher average pedagogical scores and exhibiting strong adaptability, thus highlighting the efficacy of the developed simulator.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The significant gap between rising demands for clinical training and the scarcity of expert instruction poses a major challenge to medical education. With powerful capabilities in personalized guidance, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. However, current research focuses mainly on one-on-one knowledge instruction, overlooking collaborative reasoning, a key skill for students developed in teamwork like ward rounds. To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu. Experimental results demonstrate that our MedTutor-R1 outperforms the base model by over 20% in average pedagogical score and is comparable to o3, while also exhibiting high adaptability in handling a varying number of students. This promising performance underscores the effectiveness of our pedagogical simulator, ClinEdu.</p>
