                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed methodology, Decomposition Sampling (DECOMP), is an active learning sampling strategy. It involves an initial step of decomposing images into class-specific components, facilitated by pseudo-labeling. Subsequently, regions are sampled from these derived class-specific components. The sampling process is strategically guided by class-wise predictive confidence, directing annotation efforts towards more challenging classes. The method was empirically validated by comparing its performance against baseline methods across ROI classification, 2D segmentation, and 3D segmentation tasks.</p>

                <p>DECOMP has the potential to significantly reduce the annotation burden on highly skilled medical professionals (e.g., radiologists, pathologists), thereby accelerating the development and deployment of AI models in clinical settings. By improving model accuracy, especially for rare diseases or subtle pathological findings (minority classes), it can lead to more reliable diagnostic tools, aid in earlier detection, and contribute to better patient outcomes with more efficient use of limited expert resources.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Active learning improves annotation efficiency by selecting the most informative samples for annotation and model training. While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.
