                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The zero-shot anomaly detection can be applied to automatically identify and localize novel or rare anomalies in medical images (e.g., tumors, lesions, infections) without needing prior labeled examples of those specific anomalies, thereby aiding early diagnosis. Compositional image retrieval can facilitate the searching and referencing of vast medical image databases using both visual and textual queries (e.g., finding similar cases based on an image and a clinical description). Backdoor detection is critical for ensuring the integrity and safety of medical AI models, protecting them from malicious tampering that could lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment recommendations, or other harmful outcomes, thus safeguarding patient care and preventing potential biosecurity threats through compromised AI.</p>

Compositional image retrieval could allow clinicians to quickly find relevant historical cases or research findings from vast medical databases using complex, nuanced queries (e.g., 'all CT scans showing lung ground-glass opacities with specific genetic markers'). Backdoor detection is crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness and safety of AI models deployed in clinical settings, preventing malicious tampering that could lead to misdiagnosis or patient harm.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This report presents solutions to three machine learning challenges: compositional image retrieval, zero-shot anomaly detection, and backdoored model detection. In compositional image retrieval, we developed a system that processes visual and textual inputs to retrieve relevant images, achieving 95.38\% accuracy and ranking first with a clear margin over the second team. For zero-shot anomaly detection, we designed a model that identifies and localizes anomalies in images without prior exposure to abnormal examples, securing 1st place with 73.14\% accuracy. In the backdoored model detection task, we proposed a method to detect hidden backdoor triggers in neural networks, reaching an accuracy of 78\%, which placed our approach in second place. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in addressing key challenges related to retrieval, anomaly detection, and model security, with implications for real-world applications in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. Code for all solutions is available online.</p>
