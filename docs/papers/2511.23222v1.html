                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DAONet-YOLOv8, a novel deep learning model designed to enhance the accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in challenging real-world plantation environments. It addresses issues like complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions by integrating a dual-attention fusion module, an occlusion-aware detection head, and dynamic synthesis convolutions. The model significantly outperforms the YOLOv8n baseline and other mainstream detectors on a real-world tea plantation dataset, demonstrating improved precision, recall, and mAP while reducing computational parameters.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Although focused on agriculture, the core methodological advancements—handling occlusion, complex backgrounds, subtle feature detection, and irregular boundary recognition—are highly relevant to medical imaging for disease diagnosis. These techniques can improve the accuracy and robustness of AI systems in detecting pathologies (e.g., tumors, lesions) that are often occluded by anatomical structures, present in noisy or complex tissue environments, or exhibit irregular shapes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI (DAONet-YOLOv8) is applied to detect pests and diseases on tea leaves. While not directly a 'medical AI' application in the human health sense, it is a significant AI application for 'biosecurity'. By enabling early and accurate identification of plant health threats, it supports agricultural biosecurity efforts to protect crop yields and ensure food supply stability. This indirect contribution to public health through food security aligns with broader biosecurity objectives.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.</p>
