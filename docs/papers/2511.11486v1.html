                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed method, nnUNet-B, is a Bayesian segmentation framework built upon the nnUNet-v2 architecture. It utilizes Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS), where the network undergoes cyclic training, and diverse model checkpoints are saved at various points. These sampled checkpoints are then used to approximate the posterior distribution over model parameters, allowing for the generation of both a segmentation mask and pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates (calculated via entropy and standard deviation across predictions from the sampled models). The approach was evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

Crucially, it successfully generated pixel-wise uncertainty maps, and these uncertainty estimates showed a strong correlation with actual segmentation errors, indicating their potential utility in identifying unreliable predictions. However, the calibration of these uncertainty estimates was noted as imperfect.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.</p>
