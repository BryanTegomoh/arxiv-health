                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning) is a novel deep learning framework designed for high-fidelity Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction from extremely sparse-view projections. It tackles the challenge of recovering fine-grained, high-frequency anatomical details, which are often lost in conventional methods, by integrating frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing through a unique dual-path architecture. Experimental results demonstrate DuFal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving these critical high-frequency features under severe undersampling conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DuFal employs a dual-path architecture that leverages both frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing. Its core is the High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator (HLF-FNO), which includes a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator for global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator for spatially partitioned patches. Efficiency is boosted by a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme applied to the FNO. A Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module integrates the resulting spatial and frequency features. These fused features are then processed by a Feature Decoder to generate projection representations, subsequently fed into an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline for final CT volume reconstruction. Evaluation was conducted on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.</p>
