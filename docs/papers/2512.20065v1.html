                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces PLGA-coated porous Mg-Ca silicate microspheres (diopside, bredigite, akermanite) loaded with vancomycin, designed for controlled drug release and bone tissue applications. It demonstrates that PLGA coating significantly reduces drug burst release, improves cytocompatibility, and dominates drug diffusion kinetics, with akermanite-based microspheres showing the most promising biocompatibility.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Bare silicate microspheres demonstrated significant burst release, which was effectively mitigated by PLGA coating. PLGA coating was found to be the dominant factor governing drug diffusion kinetics. The relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption was ranked as diopside > akermanite > bredigite. While drug loading initially reduced cell viability, PLGA coating substantially improved the cytocompatibility. PLGA-coated akermanite microspheres exhibited superior biocompatibility compared to diopside and bredigite, attributed to an optimal balance in the release of ceramic ions and vancomycin.</p>

                <p>This technology holds significant promise for clinical applications by enabling targeted, sustained antibiotic delivery at bone repair sites, potentially reducing surgical site infections, treating osteomyelitis, and enhancing bone regeneration in orthopedic and dental procedures. The controlled release and improved biocompatibility could lead to better patient outcomes with fewer systemic side effects associated with conventional antibiotic administration.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Porous ceramic microspheres are a desirable substance for bone tissue reconstruction and delivery applications. This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside > akermanite > bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite > diopside > bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications.</p>
