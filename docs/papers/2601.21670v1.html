                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Multimodal learning often struggles with 'geometric pathologies' like intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, even with advanced optimization, hindering robust fusion. This paper introduces \regName, a lightweight, plug-and-play geometric regularization framework, which enforces intra-modal dispersive regularization for diversity and inter-modal anchoring regularization to bound cross-modal drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, effectively mitigating modality trade-offs by explicitly structuring representation geometry.</p>

                    <p>The paper introduces \regName, a lightweight, geometry-aware regularization framework applied to intermediate embeddings in multimodal learning models.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.</p>
