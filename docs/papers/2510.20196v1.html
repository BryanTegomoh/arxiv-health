                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study systematically reviews and quantitatively profiles 54 publicly available brain MRI datasets (over 538,031 entries) to assess their suitability for foundation model development. It uncovers significant imbalances between healthy and clinical cohorts, substantial heterogeneity in image characteristics, and persistent inter-dataset variability even after standardized preprocessing. The research confirms measurable residual covariate shift in feature space, highlighting that current harmonization methods are insufficient to eliminate inter-dataset bias.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Public brain MRI datasets are characterized by strong imbalances, with large healthy cohorts outnumbering smaller clinical populations. Significant heterogeneity exists in fundamental image properties like voxel spacing and intensity distributions. While standard preprocessing improves within-dataset consistency, substantial residual differences persist between datasets. Furthermore, even after standardized preprocessing, a deep learning model (3D DenseNet121) reveals measurable residual covariate shift in feature space, confirming that harmonization alone is insufficient to eliminate inter-dataset bias.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has significant implications for the clinical deployment of AI in neuroimaging. By highlighting the pervasive data variability and bias, it underscores why AI models trained on current public data may lack generalizability and robustness when applied to diverse clinical settings (e.g., different hospitals, scanners, patient demographics). The findings will guide the development of more robust, preprocessing-aware, and domain-adaptive AI models, leading to more reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools for neurological disorders and ultimately enhancing patient care by enabling more accurate and equitable medical AI applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.</p>
