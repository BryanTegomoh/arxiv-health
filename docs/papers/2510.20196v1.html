                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.</p>
