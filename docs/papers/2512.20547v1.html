                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Mean Field Game (MFG) epidemiological model that incorporates subpopulations with diverse behavioral patterns, including highly rational agents and those following pre-specified non-rational patterns. It demonstrates, using a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) model, that the presence of non-rational behaviors and the allowance for behavioral switching significantly amplify the impact of infectious diseases. The research aims to bridge distinct modeling communities and promote behavioral considerations in broader MFG literature.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding how heterogeneous behavioral patterns and potential behavioral shifts influence disease transmission is critical for developing more effective public health interventions, accurately forecasting epidemic trajectories, and designing targeted communication strategies that resonate with diverse population responses. This model provides a framework to quantify the impact of such complexities on disease burden and healthcare resource strain.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself presents a mathematical modeling approach (Mean Field Games) rather than an AI algorithm, the insights and the model's framework could be highly valuable for AI applications in health. For example, an AI-driven public health decision support system could incorporate this model to: 
1. Predict disease trajectories under various behavioral scenarios, including 'rational' responses to policy changes and 'non-rational' adherence to habits or social mimicry. 
2. Optimize public health interventions (e.g., social distancing mandates, communication strategies) by simulating their impact on human behavior and subsequent disease spread and strain on medical resources. 
3. Develop more robust pandemic preparedness plans by accounting for the complex and dynamic interplay between disease transmission and diverse human behavioral patterns.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study develops a novel Mean Field Game (MFG) framework that segments a population into 'highly rational' individuals (optimizing long-term Nash-equilibrium contact rates) and 'non-rational' individuals (following pre-specified patterns such as habits or mimicry). This MFG model is then instantiated within a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) compartmental epidemiological model. Key features include a frequency-based force of infection and a mortality rate that sharply increases once the infected population proportion exceeds a threshold indicative of strained medical resources. The model also accounts for occasional behavioral switching, which rational agents integrate into their strategic calculations. Numerical simulations are employed to illustrate the model's properties and key findings.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that the incorporation of diverse, non-rational behavioral patterns and the allowance for behavioral switching within a population significantly exacerbates the overall impact and severity of infectious diseases, leading to increased disease burden and mortality, particularly when medical resources become strained.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more sophisticated tool for public health officials and policymakers to predict epidemic trajectories and anticipate healthcare resource needs by accounting for complex human behaviors. It highlights the necessity of designing interventions that consider not only 'rational' compliance but also ingrained habits, social influence, and the potential for shifts in behavior. This could lead to more effective public health messaging, better allocation of medical resources during crises, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes and reduced mortality.</p>

This suggests future research will likely involve applying this general framework to a wider array of infectious disease models, exploring more complex and diverse behavioral patterns, and refining the modeling of behavioral switching mechanisms within an MFG context to enhance predictive accuracy and policy relevance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We introduce a new type of Mean Field Game epidemiological models, in which subpopulations have different behavioral patterns: some are viewed as "highly rational" (choosing Nash-equilibrium long-term strategies) while others follow pre-specified "non-rational" patterns (e.g., either sticking to their usual habits or trying to mimic those around them). Our model also allows for occasional behavioral switches, which rational individuals also take into account when formulating their Nash-equilibrium strategies. While this modeling approach is general, here we develop it for individuals choosing their "contact rates" within a particular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) epidemics model. The latter is based on a frequency-based force of infection and the mortality rate that rapidly increases once the proportion of infected individuals exceeds some prescribed threshold, resulting in a strain on medical resources. Numerical tests illustrate the properties of our model and highlight the ways in which additional/non-rational behavioral patterns and behavioral switching increase the impact of infectious diseases. The paper aims to build a bridge between two distinct communities of epidemiological modelers and to promote the consideration of behavioral patterns in broader Mean Field Games literature.</p>
