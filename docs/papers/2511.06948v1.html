                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The paper introduces PADM, a novel CT-free Physics-aware Diffusion Model, to effectively correct attenuation artifacts in cardiac SPECT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI). Leveraging explicit physics priors via a teacher-student distillation mechanism, PADM accurately generates Attenuation-Corrected (AC) images solely from Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) inputs. Supported by the new CardiAC dataset, extensive experiments demonstrate PADM's superior reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art generative models.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes PADM, a diffusion-based generative model for attenuation correction. It incorporates explicit physics priors during training through a teacher-student distillation mechanism. The model is trained on the newly introduced CardiAC dataset, which provides paired Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) SPECT images, along with CT-based attenuation maps, to learn the mapping required for artifact correction. This allows PADM to generate AC images from NAC input without requiring a separate CT scan during inference.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Attenuation artifacts remain a significant challenge in cardiac Myocardial
Perfusion Imaging (MPI) using Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography
(SPECT), often compromising diagnostic accuracy and reducing clinical
interpretability. While hybrid SPECT/CT systems mitigate these artifacts
through CT-derived attenuation maps, their high cost, limited accessibility,
and added radiation exposure hinder widespread clinical adoption. In this
study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac
SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction
Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates
explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This
approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only
Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from
physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also
introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with
paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside
high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, delivering superior
reconstruction fidelity across both quantitative metrics and visual assessment.</p>
