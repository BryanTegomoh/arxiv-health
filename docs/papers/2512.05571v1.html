                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedDIFT operates by extracting multi-scale features directly from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model. These intermediate diffusion activations are then fused to construct rich, voxel-wise descriptors that inherently capture both geometric and semantic information. Correspondence between medical images is subsequently established by computing the cosine similarity between these descriptors, optionally refined by a local-search prior. The framework's core innovation lies in its ability to achieve this without requiring any task-specific training for the correspondence task itself.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate spatial correspondence between medical images is essential for longitudinal analysis, lesion tracking, and image-guided interventions. Medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures, which fail to capture global semantic structure and often yield mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions. Recent advances in diffusion models suggest that their intermediate representations encode rich geometric and semantic information. We present MedDIFT, a training-free 3D correspondence framework that leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors. MedDIFT fuses diffusion activations into rich voxel-wise descriptors and matches them via cosine similarity, with an optional local-search prior. On a publicly available lung CT dataset, MedDIFT achieves correspondence accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON model and surpasses conventional B-spline-based registration, without requiring any task-specific model training. Ablation experiments confirm that multi-level feature fusion and modest diffusion noise improve performance.</p>
