                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper models the impact of local school-level vaccine mandates on vaccine-preventable childhood diseases using a stochastic SIR household model. It reveals a counter-intuitive finding: if the overall population vaccine coverage is near herd-immunity, such local mandates can paradoxically increase both the probability of an outbreak and the infection risk for medically exempt individuals. This effect is attributed to the spatial redistribution of unvaccinated pupils to schools without mandates, creating vulnerable clusters.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides crucial insights for public health policy, demonstrating that local vaccine mandates, intended to protect, can have complex and potentially adverse consequences if not carefully implemented, particularly impacting vulnerable medically exempt populations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper uses a classical stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model, which is a foundational epidemiological modeling technique. While AI/ML can be applied to enhance such models for more complex predictions or real-time forecasting, this specific paper does not itself present an AI application to health.</p>

                    <li>A stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model is utilized, incorporating two levels of mixing (a 'household model') within a closed population.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study specifically investigates vaccine-preventable infectious diseases primarily affecting children, such as measles, rubella, mumps, and pertussis.</li>
                    
                    <li>The scenario analyzed involves schools having the autonomy to impose vaccine mandates on pupils, with provisions for medical exemptions.</li>
                    
                    <li>Key outcomes assessed are the probability of a disease outbreak and the infection probability for medically exempt pupils during an outbreak.</li>
                    
                    <li>A counter-intuitive finding indicates that when population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level, local mandates may *increase* both outbreak probability and infection risk for medically exempt individuals.</li>
                    
                    <li>This adverse effect is explained by the behavioral response of unvaccinated pupils moving to schools that do not enforce mandates, leading to their concentration in specific institutions.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model, often referred to as a household model, to simulate pathogen spread. This model features two distinct levels of mixing: high-frequency local contacts within small subgroups (e.g., households, school classes) and lower-frequency global contacts with random individuals across the entire closed population.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that if the overall population vaccine coverage is near the herd-immunity threshold, the implementation of local vaccine mandates at schools can paradoxically lead to an increased probability of disease outbreaks and a higher risk of infection for pupils who are medically exempt from vaccination. This is attributed to the spatial clustering of unvaccinated individuals.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Clinically, this suggests that local vaccine mandates need meticulous policy design to avoid unintended consequences. Mandates could inadvertently create 'hotspots' of unvaccinated individuals by driving them to specific institutions, thereby increasing localized transmission risks and potentially endangering medically vulnerable populations rather than uniformly enhancing protection.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The identified counter-intuitive impact is contingent on the population vaccine coverage being "close to the herd-immunity level." The model also operates within a "closed population" and assumes a specific behavioral response (unvaccinated pupils moving schools), which might not apply in all real-world contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We model the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we use a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g.\ within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts.
  We consider what happens if schools are given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that are exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigate how such a mandate affects the probability of an outbreak of a disease and the probability that a pupil that is medically exempt from vaccination, gets infected during an outbreak. We show that if the population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates are implemented. This is caused by unvaccinated pupils moving to schools without mandates.</p>
