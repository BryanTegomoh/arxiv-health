                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper models the impact of local school-level vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases using a stochastic SIR household model. It reveals a counter-intuitive finding: if overall population vaccine coverage is near herd immunity, such mandates may paradoxically *increase* both the probability of an outbreak and the infection risk for medically exempt individuals, primarily due to the clustering of unvaccinated children in non-mandate schools.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for public health as it challenges the assumption that all vaccine mandates uniformly improve health outcomes, specifically highlighting a potential negative consequence of localized mandates that could increase disease risk for vulnerable, medically exempt individuals.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>None. The paper employs a stochastic SIR model, which is a traditional mathematical/statistical modeling approach in epidemiology. While such models can be foundational or integrated into AI systems for disease forecasting or policy optimization, this paper itself does not describe an AI application or method.</p>

                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>The study utilizes a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model, specifically a 'household model,' incorporating two levels of mixing: frequent local contacts within subgroups (e.g., households, school classes) and less frequent global contacts.</li>
                    
                    <li>It focuses on vaccine-preventable infectious diseases primarily affecting children, such as measles, rubella, mumps, and pertussis.</li>
                    
                    <li>The research investigates the scenario where individual schools have the autonomy to impose vaccine mandates on pupils, with provisions for medical exemptions.</li>
                    
                    <li>Key outcomes analyzed include the probability of a disease outbreak and the probability that a medically exempt pupil gets infected during an outbreak.</li>
                    
                    <li>A central counter-intuitive finding is that if the population's vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level, both the probability of an outbreak and the infection risk for medically exempt pupils may *increase* with the implementation of local vaccine mandates.</li>
                    
                    <li>The mechanism explaining this counter-intuitive effect is the migration and subsequent clustering of unvaccinated pupils into schools or environments that do not impose mandates, creating localized pockets of vulnerability.</li>

                    <p>The central finding is that when the overall population vaccine coverage is already close to the herd-immunity threshold, implementing local vaccine mandates (e.g., at the school level) can counter-intuitively *increase* both the probability of a disease outbreak and the risk of infection for medically exempt pupils during such outbreaks, due to the clustering of unvaccinated individuals.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This paper suggests that localized vaccine mandate policies require careful re-evaluation, particularly in regions with high overall vaccination rates. Policymakers should consider the potential for unvaccinated individuals to cluster in non-mandate settings, which could inadvertently create new localized vulnerabilities and elevate infection risks for medically vulnerable populations, rather than uniformly enhancing public health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We model the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we use a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g.\ within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts.
  We consider what happens if schools are given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that are exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigate how such a mandate affects the probability of an outbreak of a disease and the probability that a pupil that is medically exempt from vaccination, gets infected during an outbreak. We show that if the population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates are implemented. This is caused by unvaccinated pupils moving to schools without mandates.</p>
