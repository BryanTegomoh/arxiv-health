                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper models the impact of local school-level vaccine mandates on vaccine-preventable diseases, showing a counter-intuitive effect. It reveals that if the population's vaccine coverage is near the herd-immunity level, such mandates can paradoxically increase the probability of outbreaks and the risk of infection for medically exempt pupils, primarily due to the relocation of unvaccinated individuals.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to public health and epidemiology as it highlights a critical, potentially detrimental consequence of local vaccine mandate policies. It suggests that such policies, while intended to improve public health, could inadvertently undermine disease control efforts and increase the vulnerability of medically exempt individuals under specific population immunity conditions.</p>

                    <li>A stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing, often referred to as the household model, is used to simulate disease spread within a closed population.</li>

                    <p>The study employs a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) compartmental model.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that when the general population's vaccine coverage approaches the herd-immunity level, implementing local school-based vaccine mandates can paradoxically increase both the overall probability of a disease outbreak and the specific probability of infection for medically exempt pupils. This is hypothesized to occur because unvaccinated pupils relocate to schools without mandates, creating localized concentrations of susceptible individuals.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings have significant clinical and public health policy implications. They suggest that policymakers must carefully consider the potential for local vaccine mandates to generate unintended 'pockets of susceptibility' and elevate risk for vulnerable, medically exempt individuals, particularly in settings with otherwise high overall vaccination rates. This calls for nuanced policy design, potentially favoring broader regional or national strategies over isolated local mandates to effectively maintain herd immunity and protect all members of the community.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We model the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we use a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g.\ within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts.
  We consider what happens if schools are given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that are exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigate how such a mandate affects the probability of an outbreak of a disease and the probability that a pupil that is medically exempt from vaccination, gets infected during an outbreak. We show that if the population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates are implemented. This is caused by unvaccinated pupils moving to schools without mandates.</p>
