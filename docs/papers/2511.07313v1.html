                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method for analyzing fMRI signals by applying Mahalanobis data whitening prior to dimensionality reduction, which effectively de-individualizes the data. This approach, motivated by Bures geometry and its connection to quantum mechanics, aims to distill meaningful information about subjects and stimuli from functional connectivity patterns. The methodology promises to enhance our understanding of brain function-cognition links and improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, particularly in preclinical stages.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain
disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing
changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding
and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases
or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use
of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful
information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used
to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis
whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by
similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum
mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms
that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the
accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the
preclinical stage of disease progression.</p>
