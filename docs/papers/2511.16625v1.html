                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MedBayes-Lite is a novel, lightweight Bayesian framework designed to enhance existing transformer-based clinical language models by integrating uncertainty quantification without extensive retraining or architectural modifications. It addresses the critical issue of AI overconfidence in ambiguous medical scenarios, providing reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions for safe clinical decision support. The framework significantly improves model calibration, reduces overconfidence, and can prevent a substantial percentage of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedBayes-Lite is a lightweight, post-hoc Bayesian enhancement for pre-trained transformer models. It integrates (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration, which employs Monte Carlo dropout on token embeddings to quantify epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention, designed to marginalize over token reliability within the attention mechanism, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping, a strategy inspired by clinical risk minimization to adjust final predictions based on their associated uncertainty. This framework is applied without requiring retraining of the base transformer model or changes to its architecture, introducing minimal additional parameters.</p>

                    <p>The MedBayes-Lite framework consistently improved model calibration and trustworthiness across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks. It successfully reduced overconfidence in transformer-based predictions by a substantial margin of 32% to 48%.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>MedBayes-Lite holds significant potential for real-world clinical application by making AI-driven decision support tools more reliable and actionable. By providing clear uncertainty estimates, it empowers clinicians to better interpret AI recommendations, especially in complex or ambiguous patient cases. This capability can directly lead to fewer diagnostic errors, improved patient safety, and a more efficient allocation of clinical resources, as human experts can focus their attention on cases where AI expresses low confidence.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of MedBayes-Lite itself. However, it implicitly highlights the pervasive issue of overconfidence in existing transformer models as the problem it aims to solve. Potential unstated limitations could include computational overhead in real-time, very high-throughput clinical settings (despite being 'lightweight'), or generalizability to clinical tasks and datasets beyond those evaluated.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.</p>
