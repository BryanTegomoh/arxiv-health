                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study proposes a computational approach to objectively analyze language disruptions in schizophrenia by integrating two linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. It investigates how these measures differ between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, and how they correlate with varying degrees of symptom severity. The ultimate goal is to establish these computational markers for enhanced diagnosis and symptom severity assessment.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research applies computational linguistic models and measures (surprisal, semantic coherence) to natural language data from individuals with schizophrenia. The AI application lies in developing these computational methods as objective, data-driven markers for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and the assessment of its symptom severity. This falls under medical AI/NLP for clinical decision support, diagnostic tools, and monitoring patient conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia
symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired
discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production
reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as
objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms
of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By
computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational
models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further
insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures
change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.</p>
