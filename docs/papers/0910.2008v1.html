                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops two mathematical approaches, grounded in percolation theory, to model consecutive seasonal outbreaks of partially-immunizing infections within populations characterized by heterogeneous contact networks. It reveals how immunity acquired from past epidemics fundamentally restructures the epidemiologically active host population, thereby limiting the potential of subsequent outbreaks, and speculates that this dynamic could drive the evolution of increased pathogen infectiousness.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for advancing our understanding of how past epidemics influence future disease patterns, particularly for seasonal infections like influenza. It provides a theoretical basis for predicting long-term pathogen evolution and improving public health strategies for disease control and vaccine development.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The mathematical models developed in this paper for epidemic dynamics, immunity, and pathogen evolution provide critical inputs and frameworks for AI applications in health. Specifically, AI could leverage these models for: 1) advanced epidemic forecasting and prediction, 2) simulating the impact of various public health interventions (e.g., vaccination campaigns, social distancing policies), 3) optimizing resource allocation during outbreaks, and 4) developing early warning systems for emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases by identifying patterns and risks related to long-term disease dynamics and pathogen evolution.</p>

This restructuring inherently limits the potential and scale of subsequent outbreaks.

                <p>This work can inform public health strategies by providing a deeper understanding of how population immunity evolves over time and influences future outbreak risks for seasonal diseases. It can aid in predicting the severity and timing of future epidemics, optimize vaccine deployment strategies by considering the existing immunity landscape, and help anticipate pathogen evolutionary trends, such as increased infectiousness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Many pathogens spread primarily via direct contact between infected and susceptible hosts. Thus, the patterns of contacts or contact network of a population fundamentally shapes the course of epidemics. While there is a robust and growing theory for the dynamics of single epidemics in networks, we know little about the impacts of network structure on long term epidemic or endemic transmission. For seasonal diseases like influenza, pathogens repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of susceptibility and immunity acquired through prior infection. Here, we develop two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity. Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and perfect immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune. By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population, such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these dynamics can result in evolutionary pressure to increase infectiousness.</p>
