                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops mathematical models using percolation theory to analyze the long-term dynamics of consecutive seasonal outbreaks of partially-immunizing infections in populations with contact heterogeneity.

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for understanding the long-term epidemiological patterns of recurrent infectious diseases, informing public health strategies for vaccine deployment, optimal timing of interventions, and pandemic preparedness, especially for highly variable pathogens like influenza.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself develops mathematical approaches rather than AI, the subject matter is highly amenable to AI applications in health. AI, particularly machine learning, could be used to: 
1. Enhance and validate these mathematical models by integrating large-scale real-world epidemiological data, including contact patterns and individual immunity profiles.
2. Develop more sophisticated predictive models for future disease outbreaks, leveraging the principles of network epidemiology and acquired immunity discussed in the paper.
3. Create AI-driven simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different public health interventions (e.g., vaccination strategies, social distancing) in populations with heterogeneous contact networks and varying immunity levels.
4. Design early warning systems that analyze dynamic immune landscapes and contact patterns to detect potential increases in pathogen infectiousness or shifts in outbreak potential, contributing to biosecurity preparedness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Many pathogens spread primarily via direct contact between infected and susceptible hosts. Thus, the patterns of contacts or contact network of a population fundamentally shapes the course of epidemics. While there is a robust and growing theory for the dynamics of single epidemics in networks, we know little about the impacts of network structure on long term epidemic or endemic transmission. For seasonal diseases like influenza, pathogens repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of susceptibility and immunity acquired through prior infection. Here, we develop two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity. Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and perfect immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune. By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population, such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these dynamics can result in evolutionary pressure to increase infectiousness.</p>
