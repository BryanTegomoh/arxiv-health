                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the long-term dynamics of seasonal epidemics in populations with heterogeneous contact networks and varying levels of acquired immunity. It develops two mathematical models using percolation theory to show how past outbreaks restructure the susceptible host population, thereby limiting the potential for future epidemics, and speculates on evolutionary pressures for increased pathogen infectiousness.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding how past epidemics shape future disease dynamics is crucial for forecasting recurring outbreaks, optimizing public health interventions, and developing more effective vaccine strategies for seasonal or multi-wave infectious diseases like influenza.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While this paper primarily uses mathematical modeling (percolation theory) rather than explicit AI, its insights into complex contact network dynamics, long-term epidemic patterns, and the role of population immunity are foundational for developing and refining AI applications in health. For example, AI algorithms could leverage such models to improve real-time epidemic forecasting, optimize resource allocation in healthcare during outbreaks, or simulate the impact of various public health interventions by analyzing complex contact patterns and evolving immunity landscapes at scale.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings indicate that previous epidemics fundamentally restructure the epidemiologically active host population by altering the landscape and connectivity of susceptible individuals. This restructuring serves to inherently limit the potential size and impact of subsequent outbreaks. Additionally, the authors propose that such long-term dynamics could exert an evolutionary pressure on pathogens, potentially leading to increased infectiousness.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a theoretical framework that can inform the prediction of recurring epidemic trajectories, particularly for seasonal infections. It can help public health strategists understand the cumulative impact of past outbreaks on future susceptibility, potentially guiding more targeted vaccine distribution, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and resource allocation. The speculation on evolutionary pressure also has implications for anticipating pathogen adaptation and developing long-term disease control strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Many pathogens spread primarily via direct contact between infected and susceptible hosts. Thus, the patterns of contacts or contact network of a population fundamentally shapes the course of epidemics. While there is a robust and growing theory for the dynamics of single epidemics in networks, we know little about the impacts of network structure on long term epidemic or endemic transmission. For seasonal diseases like influenza, pathogens repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of susceptibility and immunity acquired through prior infection. Here, we develop two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity. Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and perfect immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune. By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population, such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these dynamics can result in evolutionary pressure to increase infectiousness.</p>
