                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph (KG)-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that augments Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning for next-visit disease prediction using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). By integrating PrimeKG with lightweight LLMs, the models not only achieve superior predictive performance compared to classical baselines but also provide interpretable explanations preferred by clinicians, enhancing the utility of AI in patient-level decision making.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application described is the use of Knowledge Graph (KG) augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict a patient's future disease diagnosis (next-visit disease prediction) based on their past electronic health records. Crucially, it also aims to provide clinically grounded, interpretable explanations for these predictions, enhancing clinical decision support for healthcare providers and ultimately benefiting patient care.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves mapping ICD-9 codes from EHRs to PrimeKG to identify disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths. These KG-derived paths are used to scaffold Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations for next-visit disease prediction. Only CoT explanations whose conclusions align with actual observed outcomes are selected to form a supervision corpus. Lightweight Large Language Models (LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B) are then fine-tuned on this corpus. Model performance is evaluated using AUROC and macro-AUPR on MIMIC-III data and tested for zero-shot transferability to the CRADLE cohort. Clinical utility of explanations is assessed via a blinded clinician evaluation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The KG-guided LLM framework achieved superior predictive performance over classical baselines (AUROC 0.66-0.70, macro-AUPR 0.40-0.47) even with limited training data. It demonstrated robust zero-shot transferability to an external cohort (CRADLE), boosting prediction accuracy from 0.40-0.51 to 0.72-0.77. Critically, clinicians consistently preferred the KG-guided CoT explanations for their clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness, indicating high interpretability and trustworthiness.</p>

                <p>This approach offers a significant advancement for clinical decision support systems by providing not just predictions, but also clinically interpretable, temporally consistent reasoning. This enhanced transparency can increase clinician trust in AI tools, facilitate better patient education, and support more precise, explainable patient management strategies, ultimately improving clinical outcomes and reducing medical errors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Electronic health records (EHRs) support powerful clinical prediction models, but existing methods typically provide coarse, post hoc explanations that offer limited value for patient-level decision making. We introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that generates clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning for visit-level disease prediction in MIMIC-III. ICD-9 codes are mapped to PrimeKG, from which disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths are extracted and used as scaffolds for CoT generation; only explanations whose conclusions match observed outcomes are retained. Lightweight LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B models are then fine-tuned on this supervision corpus. Across ten PrimeKG-mapped diseases and limited training cohorts (400 and 1000 cases), KG-guided models outperform strong classical baselines, achieving AUROC values of 0.66 to 0.70 and macro-AUPR values of 0.40 to 0.47. The models also transfer zero-shot to the CRADLE cohort, improving accuracy from approximately 0.40 to 0.51 up to 0.72 to 0.77. A blinded clinician evaluation shows consistent preference for KG-guided CoT explanations in clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness.</p>
