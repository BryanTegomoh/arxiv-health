This framework incorporates neuron ablation, a technique to systematically remove or deactivate specific neurons to understand their contribution, and representation analysis, which examines the internal learned representations of LLMs. These advanced neuro-scientific techniques for AI were applied to evaluate LLM behavior across three medical QA datasets under different role prompts, specifically to detect alterations in underlying reasoning pathways.</p>

                    <p>The primary findings reveal that despite adopting different clinical roles through prompting, LLMs do not exhibit significantly enhanced medical reasoning abilities. Instead, the effects of role prompts are predominantly confined to surface-level linguistic features and stylistic output modifications. Crucially, no evidence was found for distinct reasoning pathways or genuine cognitive differentiation across the simulated clinical roles; the core decision-making mechanisms of the LLMs remained uniform.</p>

                <p>The findings have a significant clinical impact by indicating that simply instructing a medical LLM to 'act as an attending physician' does not confer the enhanced cognitive reasoning or specialized decision-making processes associated with that role. This implies that current AI systems relying on such prompting for advanced clinical tasks may be misleading users by providing linguistically appropriate but fundamentally undifferentiated responses, thereby limiting their actual utility and safety in complex medical decision support and educational simulations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
