                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigated whether role prompts in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) induce distinct, role-specific cognitive processes or merely alter linguistic style. Employing the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework, neuron ablation, and representation analysis on medical QA datasets, the researchers found that role prompts primarily affect surface-level linguistic features. Critically, these prompts did not enhance medical reasoning abilities, create differentiated cognitive pathways, or alter the core decision-making mechanisms of the LLMs, indicating a failure to replicate genuine cognitive complexity.</p>

                <p>This research indicates that current role-playing prompts in medical LLMs may create a misleading perception of specialized clinical expertise. Clinicians and developers should recognize that prompting an LLM to act as a 'resident' or 'attending' does not genuinely imbue it with the corresponding cognitive depth or reasoning. This underscores the critical need for developing more sophisticated AI models that can simulate genuine, complex medical cognition for robust and safe clinical applications, moving beyond mere linguistic imitation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
