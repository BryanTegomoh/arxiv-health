                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MedRule-KG, a novel system designed to impose domain-consistent structure on large language models (LLMs) for scientific reasoning and early-stage drug discovery. By combining a knowledge-graph scaffold with a lightweight verifier, MedRule-KG steers LLM generation towards mathematically and biomedically valid outputs. The system significantly reduces violation counts by 83.2% while improving exact match across tasks like reaction feasibility, metabolic compatibility, and toxicity screening, making LLM-based drug discovery more reliable and practical.</p>

                    <p>MedRule-KG consists of a compact knowledge-graph scaffold and a lightweight verifier. The system injects curated symbolic facts directly into LLM prompts. A deterministic checker then enforces the satisfaction of these rules on the LLM's generated output.

Performance was thoroughly analyzed statistically with uncertainty quantification across 90 tasks, comparing against a chain-of-thought baseline.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We study how to impose domain-consistent structure on large language models (LLMs) used for scientific reasoning and early-stage drug discovery. We present MedRule-KG, a compact knowledge-graph scaffold paired with a lightweight verifier that steers generation toward mathematically and biomedically valid outputs. The system injects curated symbolic facts into prompts and then enforces rule satisfaction with a deterministic checker. We formalize generation as constrained inference, introduce a soft guidance surrogate suitable for decoding, and perform a thorough statistical analysis with uncertainty quantification. Across 90 tasks spanning reaction feasibility, metabolic compatibility, and toxicity screening, MedRule-KG reduces violation counts by 83.2\% relative to a strong chain-of-thought baseline while improving exact match. Results remain stable under stratification and scale with dataset size, and the verifier adds negligible latency, making the approach practical for interactive design.</p>
