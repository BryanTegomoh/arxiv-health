                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Latent-X2 is a novel generative AI model that achieves zero-shot design of drug-like molecules, particularly antibodies, with strong binding affinities and exceptional developability profiles. Uniquely, it is the first AI to design antibodies confirmed to have low immunogenicity in human donor panels, demonstrating therapeutic viability without extensive optimization.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This technology significantly accelerates early-stage drug discovery by directly generating therapeutic candidates that are not only potent but also inherently developable and non-immunogenic, addressing major bottlenecks that lead to high failure rates and costs in preclinical and clinical development.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI model Latent-X2 is applied to the zero-shot generative design of novel therapeutic antibodies (VHH, scFv) and macrocyclic peptides. It aims to create molecules with desired drug-like properties (e.g., strong binding affinity, expression yield, thermal stability, low aggregation propensity) and, crucially, confirmed low immunogenicity in human panels, thereby accelerating and improving the drug discovery process for various medical conditions, including previously 'undruggable' targets like K-Ras.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Latent-X2 is an all-atom generative AI model. It is conditioned on specific inputs including the target structure, an epitope specification, and optionally, an antibody framework. The model operates by jointly generating both the molecular sequence and its corresponding 3D structure, while simultaneously modeling the bound complex with the target. This enables a 'zero-shot' design approach, producing drug candidates with desired properties directly, without iterative optimization or selection steps.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The model successfully designed VHH and scFv antibodies against 9 out of 18 evaluated targets, achieving picomolar to nanomolar binding affinities. These designed molecules exhibited developability profiles (e.g., expression yield, aggregation propensity, thermal stability) that met or surpassed those of approved therapeutics, without any post-design optimization. Most notably, Latent-X2 produced the first AI-generated antibodies (VHH binders targeting TNFL9) confirmed to have low immunogenicity in human donor panels, validated by T-cell proliferation and cytokine release assays. The model also demonstrated generalization by generating competitive macrocyclic peptide binders against K-Ras.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This breakthrough can significantly shorten the drug development pipeline by providing highly optimized, safe, and effective therapeutic candidates (antibodies, peptides) from the initial design phase. By pre-empting issues like immunogenicity and poor developability, Latent-X2 could drastically reduce the attrition rate of drugs in preclinical and clinical trials, leading to faster development of novel treatments for a wide range of diseases, including those targeting historically 'undruggable' proteins like K-Ras, ultimately making new medicines more accessible and affordable.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Drug discovery has long sought computational systems capable of designing drug-like molecules directly: developable and non-immunogenic from the start. Here we introduce Latent-X2, a frontier generative model that achieves this goal through zero-shot design of antibodies with strong binding affinities, drug-like properties, and, for the first time for any de novo generated antibody, confirmed low immunogenicity in human donor panels. Latent-X2 is an all-atom model conditioned on target structure, epitope specification, and optional antibody framework, jointly generating sequences and structures while modelling the bound complex. Testing only 4 to 24 designs per target in each modality, we successfully generated VHH and scFv antibodies against 9 of 18 evaluated targets, achieving a 50% target-level success rate with picomolar to nanomolar binding affinities. Designed molecules exhibit developability profiles that match or exceed those of approved antibody therapeutics, including expression yield, aggregation propensity, polyreactivity, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability, without optimization, filtering, or selection. In the first immunogenicity assessment of any AI-generated antibody, representative de novo VHH binders targeting TNFL9 exhibit both potent target engagement and low immunogenicity across T-cell proliferation and cytokine release assays. The model generalizes beyond antibodies: against K-Ras, long considered undruggable, we generated macrocyclic peptide binders competitive with trillion-scale mRNA display screens. These properties emerge directly from the model, demonstrating the therapeutic viability of zero-shot molecular design, now available without AI infrastructure or coding expertise at https://platform.latentlabs.com.</p>
