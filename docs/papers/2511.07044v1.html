                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mental health disorders affect over one-fifth of adults globally, yet
detecting such conditions from text remains challenging due to the subtle and
varied nature of symptom expression. This study evaluates multiple approaches
for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based
architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ
dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression,
and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate
class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score
(0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to
0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach
(SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the
value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization. However,
careful calibration is required to prevent precision loss. Overall, this work
emphasizes the potential of combining advanced language models and data
augmentation to enhance automated mental health assessment from text.</p>
