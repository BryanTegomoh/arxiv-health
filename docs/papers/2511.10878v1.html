                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Multi-Joint Physics-Informed Deep Learning (PI-DL) framework, PI-MJCA-BiGRU, for time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems. It addresses the challenges of high computational cost and lack of labeled datasets in conventional inverse dynamics methods by leveraging a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with BiGRU layers and embedding multi-joint dynamics into the loss function.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.</p>
