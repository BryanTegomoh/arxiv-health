                    <p>The study proposes a novel deep learning-based multimodal framework that integrates three distinct data sources: Late Gadolinium-Enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI scans, electrophysiological information derived from ECG signals, and anatomical prior knowledge from the AHA-17 cardiac segmentation atlas. A key innovation is the Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism, designed to dynamically weight and fuse features from ECG and LGE-MRI by considering their respective acquisition time differences, as these modalities are not acquired simultaneously. The model was trained and evaluated on a clinical dataset, with its performance compared against an image-only state-of-the-art baseline (nnU-Net).</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.</p>
