                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the competitive dynamics between two strains of an infectious disease, one more transmissible and the other more immune-resistant, under varying levels of natural and vaccine immunity. It demonstrates that vaccination significantly impacts which strain dominates a population, potentially causing dramatic shifts, and that the interplay between natural and vaccine immunity mechanisms determines which strain gains advantage as overall immunity increases.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical insights into how vaccination influences pathogen evolution and strain competition, which is essential for designing effective public health interventions, predicting disease dynamics, and understanding the long-term impact of immunisation programs on infectious disease prevalence.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself employs mathematical modeling (SIR-type models, delay differential equations) rather than AI, its subject matter and findings are highly pertinent to AI applications in health. AI and machine learning models could leverage the insights from such studies to: 1) Predict future strain dominance and disease trajectories under various vaccination strategies. 2) Optimize vaccine deployment and booster schedules based on real-time epidemiological data and strain characteristics. 3) Develop early warning systems for emergent strains or vaccine escape variants. 4) Inform adaptive public health policies by simulating the complex interplay between immunity levels and strain competition using AI-driven scenario analysis.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs two SIR-type compartmental models to simulate the competitive interaction between disease strains. It incorporates waning natural immunity using a gamma-distributed delay, which is mathematically handled by the 'linear chain trick' to transform the resulting delay differential equation systems into more tractable ordinary differential equations. Distinct mechanisms for vaccine immunity are also integrated into these models to assess their impact on strain competition.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings reveal that vaccination critically alters the competitive balance between disease strains, potentially leading to dramatic shifts where one dominant strain is replaced by another. Furthermore, the advantage gained by a particular strain as population immunity levels increase is determined by the specific interplay and integration between natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>These findings directly inform vaccination strategies, suggesting that policy makers must consider potential impacts on strain dominance. For instance, a vaccine effective against a transmissible strain might inadvertently favor an immune-resistant strain, or vice-versa. This understanding is vital for optimizing vaccine design, deployment schedules, and anticipating the evolutionary trajectory of pathogens to maintain vaccine effectiveness and guide public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate how a population's natural and vaccine immunity affects the competitive balance between two strains of an infectious disease with different epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case where one strain is more transmissible and the other strain is more immune-resistant. The competition of these strains is modeled by two SIR-type models which incorporate waning natural immunity and which have distinct mechanisms for vaccine immunity. Waning immunity is implemented as a gamma-distributed delay, which is analyzed using the linear chain trick to transform the delay differential equation systems into a system of ordinary differential equations. Our analysis shows that vaccination has a significant effect on the competitive balance between two strains, potentially leading to dramatic flips from one strain dominating in the population to the other. We also show that which strain gains an advantage as a population's immunity level increases depends upon the integration between the mechanisms of natural and vaccine immunity. The results of this paper are consequently relevant for public policy.</p>
