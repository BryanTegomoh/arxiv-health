                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates how a population's natural and vaccine immunity influences the competitive balance between two infectious disease strains with differing epidemiological characteristics (one more transmissible, one more immune-resistant). It demonstrates that vaccination significantly alters strain dominance, with the specific outcome depending on the integration of natural and vaccine immunity mechanisms, providing crucial insights for public health policy.</p>

                    <li>A primary finding is that vaccination has a significant, often dramatic, effect on the competitive balance, capable of flipping which strain dominates in the population.</li>

                    <p>Vaccination exerts a profound influence on the competitive balance between infectious disease strains, with the potential to cause dramatic shifts in which strain dominates. Furthermore, the specific strain that gains an advantage as population immunity rises is contingent upon the intricate integration and interaction mechanisms between natural and vaccine-induced immunity.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings have direct implications for vaccine design and public health interventions. Understanding how vaccination impacts strain competition can inform strategies to prevent the emergence or dominance of more virulent or resistant strains, optimize vaccine compositions (e.g., multivalent vaccines), guide immunization schedules, and improve disease surveillance, ultimately leading to more effective control of infectious diseases with multiple circulating strains.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate how a population's natural and vaccine immunity affects the competitive balance between two strains of an infectious disease with different epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case where one strain is more transmissible and the other strain is more immune-resistant. The competition of these strains is modeled by two SIR-type models which incorporate waning natural immunity and which have distinct mechanisms for vaccine immunity. Waning immunity is implemented as a gamma-distributed delay, which is analyzed using the linear chain trick to transform the delay differential equation systems into a system of ordinary differential equations. Our analysis shows that vaccination has a significant effect on the competitive balance between two strains, potentially leading to dramatic flips from one strain dominating in the population to the other. We also show that which strain gains an advantage as a population's immunity level increases depends upon the integration between the mechanisms of natural and vaccine immunity. The results of this paper are consequently relevant for public policy.</p>
