                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates how natural and vaccine-induced immunity influence the competitive dynamics between two strains of an infectious disease with contrasting epidemiological traits (one more transmissible, the other more immune-resistant). It demonstrates that vaccination critically alters strain dominance, capable of causing dramatic shifts between prevalent strains, with the specific outcome depending on the integration of natural and vaccine immunity mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for understanding the evolutionary pressures on pathogens exerted by vaccination, helping public health officials predict and manage the emergence or dominance of specific disease strains, especially those with increased transmissibility or immune evasion capabilities.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While this paper primarily uses mathematical modeling (SIR-type models, differential equations) rather than AI, its findings are highly relevant for informing medical AI applications. AI models could be built upon these epidemiological principles to: 1) Predict future dominant strains based on real-time surveillance data and vaccination coverage, aiding in proactive public health responses. 2) Optimize vaccine distribution strategies and booster campaign timings to effectively manage strain competition and prevent the rise of more dangerous variants. 3) Develop AI-driven decision support systems for policymakers to simulate outcomes of different vaccination policies on population health and biosecurity.</p>

                    <p>The study utilizes two SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)-type compartmental models to simulate the competitive interaction of two strains. A key feature is the incorporation of waning natural immunity, implemented as a gamma-distributed delay, which is mathematically transformed from a system of delay differential equations into a system of ordinary differential equations using the linear chain trick for analytical tractability. The models also distinguish between different mechanisms of vaccine immunity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate how a population's natural and vaccine immunity affects the competitive balance between two strains of an infectious disease with different epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case where one strain is more transmissible and the other strain is more immune-resistant. The competition of these strains is modeled by two SIR-type models which incorporate waning natural immunity and which have distinct mechanisms for vaccine immunity. Waning immunity is implemented as a gamma-distributed delay, which is analyzed using the linear chain trick to transform the delay differential equation systems into a system of ordinary differential equations. Our analysis shows that vaccination has a significant effect on the competitive balance between two strains, potentially leading to dramatic flips from one strain dominating in the population to the other. We also show that which strain gains an advantage as a population's immunity level increases depends upon the integration between the mechanisms of natural and vaccine immunity. The results of this paper are consequently relevant for public policy.</p>
