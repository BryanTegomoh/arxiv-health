                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to test vision-language models (VLMs) on naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across various imaging modalities. The study reveals a critical weakness: state-of-the-art VLMs, including top performers like GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, experience a drastic performance drop (from 74% to 29% mean accuracy) when confronted with atypical anatomy compared to typical presentations, with current mitigation strategies proving ineffective.</p>

                <p>The findings have profound clinical impact, highlighting a significant patient safety concern. VLMs integrated into clinical workflows could misinterpret or completely fail to recognize rare but clinically significant anatomical variants, leading to misdiagnoses, delayed treatment, or incorrect surgical planning. This necessitates rigorous testing against such 'natural adversarial' cases before widespread clinical deployment and emphasizes the need for bias mitigation in medical AI to ensure equitable and safe patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision-language models are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess performance on common anatomical presentations and fail to capture the challenges posed by rare variants. To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about "typical" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations. AdversarialAnatomyBench provides a foundation for systematically measuring and mitigating anatomical bias in multimodal medical AI systems.</p>
