                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark dataset comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across various medical imaging modalities, to evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs revealed a drastic accuracy drop from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy, with leading models also showing significant performance degradation, highlighting a critical generalization weakness. The findings emphasize that current VLMs struggle with uncommon medical presentations, posing substantial risks for their integration into clinical workflows.</p>

It reveals that VLMs, if deployed clinically without addressing these weaknesses, could misinterpret or completely miss rare but crucial anatomical findings, potentially leading to incorrect diagnoses, delayed treatments, or adverse patient outcomes for individuals with atypical presentations.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved creating AdversarialAnatomyBench, a new benchmark dataset curated with naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across various medical imaging modalities and anatomical regions. This benchmark was then used to evaluate the performance of 22 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on basic medical perception tasks. The evaluation compared VLM accuracy on typical versus atypical anatomical presentations and analyzed the nature of errors. Additionally, the researchers investigated whether model scaling or interventions like bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning could mitigate the observed performance drops.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>1. **Significant Performance Degradation:** Vision-language models exhibited a drastic decline in accuracy, from a mean of 74% on typical anatomical presentations to only 29% on rare, atypical anatomy. Top-tier models experienced severe performance drops of 41-51%. 2. **Anatomical Bias in Errors:** Model errors were consistent with expected anatomical biases, suggesting VLMs strongly prioritize learned common anatomical patterns. 3. **Ineffectiveness of Mitigation Strategies:** Attempts to improve performance through increased model scaling or advanced interventions such as bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning proved unsuccessful in addressing these generalization issues.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings have profound clinical impact, highlighting a major barrier to the safe and effective deployment of VLMs in clinical practice. The demonstrated failure of VLMs to reliably interpret rare anatomical variants means they are currently unfit for autonomous decision-making in diverse patient populations. This necessitates stringent validation, continuous human oversight, and specialized training data focused on atypical cases to prevent misdiagnosis and ensure equitable, high-quality care for all patients, particularly those with uncommon conditions.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The paper identifies a critical and previously unquantified limitation of current Vision-Language Models: their profound inability to generalize robustly to rare anatomical presentations. This intrinsic weakness is not resolved by increasing model scale or implementing advanced prompting/reasoning techniques. It also implicitly highlights a limitation of existing VLM benchmarks, which are inadequate for assessing real-world clinical performance due to their focus on common anatomical presentations.</p>

This opens avenues for future research to develop more robust VLM architectures, novel training methodologies, and bias-aware learning algorithms specifically designed to improve generalization to rare anatomical variants, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of medical AI in diverse clinical scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision-language models are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess performance on common anatomical presentations and fail to capture the challenges posed by rare variants. To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about "typical" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations. AdversarialAnatomyBench provides a foundation for systematically measuring and mitigating anatomical bias in multimodal medical AI systems.</p>
