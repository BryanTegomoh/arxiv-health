                    <p>The core methodology involves a general nonparametric additive instrumental variable framework. Identification of mean potential outcomes and ATE is achieved through specifically constructed weighting functions.

The framework is extended to address complexities in longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and scenarios requiring multiplicative IV structures.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is the successful development and validation of a nonparametric framework capable of identifying and efficiently estimating causal effects using general (multi-categorical or continuous) instrumental variables. It demonstrates that the proposed additive IV framework, combined with weighting functions and DML, yields consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of mean potential outcomes and the ATE, even in complex scenarios like longitudinal data or dynamic regimes.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This methodology significantly enhances the ability to draw robust causal conclusions from observational medical data, where ethical or practical constraints often prevent randomized controlled trials. By accommodating complex instrumental variables and employing advanced machine learning for debiased estimation, it can provide more reliable evidence for drug safety and efficacy, treatment comparisons, and public health policy interventions. This could lead to better-informed clinical guidelines, improved patient outcomes, and more efficient healthcare resource allocation, especially when dealing with unmeasured confounding factors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when
treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we
develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with
multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we
propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential
outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging
semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct
consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning.
Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative
instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed
method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job
Training Partnership Act program.</p>
