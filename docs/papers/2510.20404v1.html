                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a general nonparametric framework for identifying and learning causal effects using multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables (IVs) in situations where unobserved confounders bias treatment assignment. It proposes an additive IV framework to estimate mean potential outcomes and the average treatment effect (ATE) by employing a weighting function. The authors leverage debiased machine learning to construct consistent, asymptotically normal estimators with efficient influence functions, demonstrating its utility in simulations and real-world data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant for medicine and health research, particularly in observational studies where treatment assignment (e.g., drug prescription, lifestyle intervention) is often confounded by unmeasured factors. It provides a robust statistical tool to estimate the true causal effects of treatments and interventions, improving the validity of evidence-based medical conclusions and health policy decisions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The debiased machine learning approach for causal effect estimation can be applied to develop more robust and reliable AI systems for clinical decision support, inferring treatment effectiveness from real-world electronic health records or claims data, and designing adaptive treatment protocols. This allows AI models to provide more accurate and less confounded insights into optimal patient care, especially in complex and dynamic health conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when
treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we
develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with
multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we
propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential
outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging
semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct
consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning.
Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative
instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed
method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job
Training Partnership Act program.</p>
