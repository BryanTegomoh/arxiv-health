                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a general nonparametric framework for identifying and learning causal effects using multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables (IVs). It proposes an additive IV framework to identify mean potential outcomes and the average treatment effect (ATE), employing semiparametric theory and debiased machine learning to construct consistent and asymptotically normal estimators, with extensions to complex data structures.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant to medical and health research as it provides a robust means to estimate true causal effects in observational studies, where unobserved confounding often biases findings on treatment efficacy, disease etiology, or intervention impact. It allows for stronger evidence generation when randomized controlled trials are unfeasible.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides advanced methodological tools for developing more robust and unbiased medical AI applications. For instance, AI systems could use these methods to: 1) estimate the true causal effect of a drug or medical intervention from observational patient data, mitigating bias from unmeasured confounding factors; 2) develop AI algorithms for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes, recommending sequential treatments for patients based on their evolving health status, a core problem in personalized medicine; 3) identify causal risk factors for diseases from complex health datasets, even when not all confounders are known or measurable; 4) enhance AI models for predictive analytics in healthcare by focusing on causal relationships rather than mere correlations.</p>

                    <p>The paper develops a general nonparametric framework centered on an additive instrumental variable (IV) model to identify mean potential outcomes and the average treatment effect (ATE).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when
treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we
develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with
multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we
propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential
outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging
semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct
consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning.
Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative
instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed
method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job
Training Partnership Act program.</p>
