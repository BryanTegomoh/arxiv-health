                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ProFees, an LLM-based framework designed to automate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, a complex task critical for medical billing. ProFees aims to tackle the real-world complexities inherent in E/M coding, significantly reducing physicians' documentation burden and improving billing accuracy. The framework demonstrates substantial improvements in coding accuracy on a real-world dataset compared to existing solutions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.</p>
