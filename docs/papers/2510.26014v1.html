                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel dual Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for discrete-time survival analysis, aiming to better model patient heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. The framework integrates a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning with a hazard MoE that uses patient features and time embeddings to capture dynamic risks. Evaluated on METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets, the method consistently improved the time-dependent C-index by up to 0.04 and showed further gains when combined with the Consurv framework.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.</p>
