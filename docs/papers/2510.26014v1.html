                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel dual Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for discrete-time survival analysis, aiming to precisely model patient heterogeneity and temporal risk dynamics. The framework integrates a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning with a hazard MoE that leverages time embeddings to capture temporal patterns. Evaluated on breast cancer datasets, the method significantly boosts the time-dependent C-index by up to 0.04, demonstrating consistent performance improvements and further gains when integrated into the Consurv framework.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on a dual Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. A feature-encoder MoE first processes patient features to learn subgroup-aware representations. These representations, combined with time embeddings, are then fed into a second MoE, a hazard MoE, which models time-varying hazard rates within a discrete-time framework. This modular design allows for flexible integration with existing deep learning survival pipelines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.</p>
