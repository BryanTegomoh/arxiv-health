                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces FAITH, a novel framework that leverages medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for automated factuality assessment of large language model (LLM) responses in healthcare, addressing the critical need for rigorous verification in high-stakes medical settings. FAITH decomposes LLM responses into atomic claims, links them to a medical KG, and scores them based on evidence paths, demonstrating significantly higher correlations with clinician judgments, robustness to textual variance, and the ability to distinguish LLMs of varying capabilities. Its inherent explainability further aids in understanding and mitigating LLM limitations, positioning KGs as a prominent direction for reliable LLM deployment in medicine.</p>

                    <p>The paper introduces FAITH, a framework for automated factuality evaluation operating without reference answers. It functions by: 1) **Decomposing** LLM-generated responses into atomic claims. 2) **Linking** these claims to entities and relationships within a comprehensive medical knowledge graph (KG). 3) **Scoring** the claims based on the existence and structure of evidence paths found within the KG. Experiments involved applying FAITH to diverse medical tasks and validating its performance through comparison with human subjective evaluations provided by clinicians.</p>

                <p>This work has the potential to significantly enhance the safety and reliability of LLMs in healthcare by providing a scalable, automated mechanism for factual verification. It can prevent the dissemination of inaccurate medical information, thereby reducing clinical errors and improving patient outcomes. By offering explainable feedback, it can also foster greater trust among clinicians in AI tools and guide developers in building more robust and factually sound medical LLMs for applications ranging from clinical decision support to medical information synthesis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare, with strong capabilities in diverse medical tasks. Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.</p>
