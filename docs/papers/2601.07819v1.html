                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper advocates for a more comprehensive approach to managing primary hypothyroidism by utilizing both Thyrotropin (TSH) and free Thyroxine (FT4) values, instead of TSH alone. It introduces Hypothalamus-Pituitary (HP) curves, generated via two novel non-linear programming solver methods, as a tool to determine patient-specific optimal thyroid hormone set points. These methods aim to enable physicians to develop personalized thyroid replacement strategies, with their efficacy tested against existing methods using literature and patient datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Common practice in treating primary hypothyroidism is to use only Thyrothropin (TSH) to adjust the dose of thyroid replacement. In this paper, it is argued that using both TSH and free Thyroxine (FT4) values in the replacement may be beneficial in the treatment of hypothyroidism. The tool to determine the optimal value of TSH and FT4 is the Hypothalamus-Pituitary (HP) curve. These curves are models of thyroid hormone concentrations that can be used to determine patient-specific treatment strategies for individuals with hypothyroidism. By generating an HP curve for an individual with hypothyroidism, a set point is determined that represents the optimal levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. A graphical method for set point determination is proposed. A physician can then prescribe a thyroid replacement strategy to achieve this set point. In this paper, two methods for generating HP curves are proposed using non-linear programming solvers and compared with the existing methods. The proposed methods are tested using datasets from the literature, as well as measurements of patients being treated for hypothyroidism.</p>
