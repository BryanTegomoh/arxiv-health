                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>ReBrain employs a multi-component approach: A Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) first synthesizes MRI slices along the 2D dimension from limited CT input slices. Concurrently, a fine-tuned retrieval model queries a prior database for structurally and pathologically similar CT slices. These retrieved slices serve as references and are fed into a ControlNet branch, which guides the BBDM's generation of intermediate MRI slices to ensure structural continuity. For rare instances of retrieval failure, spherical linear interpolation is used to provide alternative guidance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.</p>
