                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference, termed the Maxitive Donsker-Varadhan Formulation, to address the challenges of traditional Bayesian Variational Inference (VI) when dealing with high-dimensional integrals and subjective probabilities. It adapts VI to possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework robust for modeling epistemic uncertainty in sparse or imprecise data, by rethinking core concepts like entropy and divergence. The work applies this new framework to exponential-family functions, highlighting its unique mathematical structures and parallels with probabilistic counterparts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.</p>
