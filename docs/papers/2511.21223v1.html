                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel "Maxitive Donsker-Varadhan Formulation" for possibilistic variational inference, aiming to address the limitations of traditional probabilistic VI when dealing with intractable high-dimensional integrals and subjective probabilities. By leveraging possibility theory, this framework directly models epistemic uncertainty, offering enhanced robustness and interpretability, particularly for sparse or imprecise data. The authors develop this principled formulation by adapting core VI concepts like entropy and divergence to a possibilistic setting, applying it to exponential-family functions and revealing unique mathematical structures.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Medical and health data frequently suffer from sparsity, imprecision, or inherent epistemic uncertainty (e.g., rare disease prevalence, incomplete patient records, subjective symptom reporting). This possibilistic VI framework offers a method for more robust and interpretable approximate inference in complex medical models, potentially leading to more reliable diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment recommendations, especially where data is scarce or ambiguous.</p>

                <p>This foundational work could enable more robust, interpretable, and reliable AI models for various healthcare applications. For instance, it could improve diagnostic and prognostic models by better quantifying and communicating epistemic uncertainty, especially when dealing with limited patient data. It could also enhance the discovery of biomarkers from sparse omics datasets, or assist in personalized treatment regimen design where individual patient data is often limited. The focus on interpretability would make AI models more acceptable and actionable for clinicians.</p>

                <p>This theoretical advance holds promise for developing more reliable and transparent AI models in healthcare.

Empirical validation using real-world medical and health datasets is crucial to demonstrate its practical advantages over probabilistic VI, especially in scenarios with high data sparsity or imprecision. Further research could also explore its integration into specific clinical applications to assess its impact on diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.</p>
