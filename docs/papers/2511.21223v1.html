                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops a principled formulation for possibilistic variational inference (VI), an adaptation of traditional VI to possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework. It addresses the challenges of extending VI concepts like entropy and divergence, which typically presuppose additivity, to model epistemic uncertainty directly, especially under sparse or imprecise information. The authors apply this new framework to exponential-family functions, highlighting its unique mathematical structures and parallels with probabilistic counterparts.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has the potential to enhance the reliability and transparency of AI-driven tools in healthcare. By explicitly modeling epistemic uncertainty, clinicians can gain a clearer understanding of when a model's prediction is genuinely uncertain due to lack of data (as opposed to reducible aleatoric uncertainty), leading to more cautious and informed decision-making, particularly in critical areas like diagnosis or treatment recommendations for complex or rare conditions. This could improve patient safety and trust in AI systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.</p>
