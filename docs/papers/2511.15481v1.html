                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>FunnyNodules employs a generative approach to create synthetic images resembling lung nodules. It achieves this by defining abstract shapes with parameterizable visual attributes (e.g., roundness, spiculation, margin sharpness). A key methodological aspect is the user's ability to predefine a deterministic decision rule that links specific combinations of these visual attributes directly to a diagnostic target class. This ensures complete ground truth reasoning is embedded within each generated instance, allowing for precise control and evaluation of how AI models learn and utilize these attributes for classification.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The paper demonstrates FunnyNodules' utility in several key areas: firstly, it allows for assessing whether AI models accurately learn the ground truth attribute-target relations defined in the dataset. Secondly, it facilitates the interpretation of model prediction over- or underperformance by linking it back to specific attribute predictions. Lastly, it enables the analysis of how well a model's attention mechanisms align with the attribute-specific regions of interest within the generated images, providing insights into its 'reasoning' process.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By facilitating the development of transparent and rigorously evaluated explainable AI, FunnyNodules can significantly enhance clinical trust and adoption of AI in diagnostic medicine. This will enable radiologists and other clinicians to understand the rationale behind AI recommendations, promoting shared decision-making, improving diagnostic accuracy for critical conditions like lung cancer, and potentially reducing medical errors. Ultimately, it aims to deliver more reliable and accountable AI tools that can directly benefit patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While powerful for xAI evaluation, the synthetic nature of FunnyNodules inherently means it simplifies the immense variability, noise, and complex pathological nuances present in real-world medical images. The abstract nodule-like shapes, while excellent for isolating reasoning, may not fully capture the full spectrum of challenges AI faces with authentic patient data. The abstract doesn't explicitly state these as limitations, but they are general considerations for synthetic datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Densely annotated medical image datasets that capture not only diagnostic labels but also the underlying reasoning behind these diagnoses are scarce. Such reasoning-related annotations are essential for developing and evaluating explainable AI (xAI) models that reason similarly to radiologists: making correct predictions for the right reasons. To address this gap, we introduce FunnyNodules, a fully parameterized synthetic dataset designed for systematic analysis of attribute-based reasoning in medical AI models. The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class. We demonstrate how FunnyNodules can be used in model-agnostic evaluations to assess whether models learn correct attribute-target relations, to interpret over- or underperformance in attribute prediction, and to analyze attention alignment with attribute-specific regions of interest. The framework is fully customizable, supporting variations in dataset complexity, target definitions, class balance, and beyond. With complete ground truth information, FunnyNodules provides a versatile foundation for developing, benchmarking, and conducting in-depth analyses of explainable AI methods in medical image analysis.</p>
