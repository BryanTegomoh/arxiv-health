                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.</p>
