                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper details the development and pilot evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) simulator designed for High Dose Rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy. The simulator, comprising patient preparation and template-guided needle insertion modules, significantly increased self-reported confidence among oncology staff and trainees across various procedural and equipment-related knowledge domains immediately after training.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This VR simulator provides a safe, reproducible, and accessible platform for training medical professionals in complex HDR prostate brachytherapy, which is crucial for improving procedural competency and patient safety in a high-risk oncology procedure without exposing actual patients to learning-related errors.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a virtual reality simulator for medical training. While VR technologies can sometimes incorporate AI for adaptive learning or performance feedback, the abstract does not explicitly mention or detail any specific AI components or applications within the simulator. It is primarily a medical application of VR technology rather than a medical AI application based solely on the provided information.</p>

                    <p>The study involved developing two VR modules (patient preparation and template-guided needle insertion) using Unreal Engine. A pilot evaluation was conducted at two sites with oncology staff and trainees.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This VR simulator provides a practical and innovative training tool that can enhance the foundational knowledge and confidence of oncology staff and trainees in performing HDR prostate brachytherapy. By enabling risk-free practice of complex procedures, it has the potential to improve the quality of training, reduce the learning curve, and ultimately contribute to safer and more effective treatment delivery for prostate cancer patients.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study was a pilot evaluation, and the assessment relied on self-reported confidence, which is a subjective measure. The sample sizes were relatively small (N=11 for patient preparation, N=27 for needle insertion), and the evaluation focused on immediate gains, not assessing long-term retention of confidence or objective skill transfer to clinical practice.</p>

Subsequent research could investigate the simulator's impact on objective skill performance, long-term knowledge retention, and ultimately, patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To develop a virtual reality simulator for high dose rate prostate
brachytherapy and to test whether participation is associated with immediate
gains in self-reported confidence across predefined procedural domains in two
cohorts. Methods: Two modules were developed and implemented using Unreal
Engine: patient preparation and template guided needle insertion. Oncology
staff and trainees completed pre and post surveys that assessed confidence for
recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining
equipment function. Studies were conducted at the Hands On Brachytherapy
Workshop (HOWBT) in London, Ontario, and at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre in
Toronto, Ontario. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p values
compared before and after scores within each module. Results: Patient
preparation (N=11) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002),
explaining steps (W=51, p = 0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and
explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). Needle insertion (N=27)
confidence increased for recalling steps (W=292, p<0.001), explaining steps
(W=347, p<0.001), identifying equipment (W=355, p<0.001), and explaining
equipment function (W=354, p<0.001). Conclusion: The simulator was feasible to
deploy and was associated with higher self-reported confidence across key
domains immediately after training. Findings may inform future curriculum
design and implementation work.</p>
