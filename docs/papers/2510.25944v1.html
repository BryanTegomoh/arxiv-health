                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper details the development and pilot evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) simulator for high dose rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy, featuring modules for patient preparation and template-guided needle insertion. The study demonstrated that immediate participation in the VR simulation significantly increased self-reported confidence among oncology staff and trainees across key procedural domains. These findings suggest the simulator's potential for informing future curriculum design in brachytherapy training.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>A virtual reality simulator was developed using Unreal Engine, featuring two modules: patient preparation and template-guided needle insertion for HDR prostate brachytherapy. A pilot evaluation was conducted with oncology staff and trainees from two cohorts at different sites. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation surveys to assess self-reported confidence across four domains: recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining equipment function. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p-values were used for statistical comparison of before and after scores within each module.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>For the patient preparation module (N=11), confidence significantly increased for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002), explaining steps (W=51, p=0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). For the needle insertion module (N=27), confidence also significantly increased for recalling steps (W=292, p<0.001), explaining steps (W=347, p<0.001), identifying equipment (W=355, p<0.001), and explaining equipment function (W=354, p<0.001).

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This VR simulator provides a practical and accessible tool for training oncology staff and trainees in the intricate aspects of HDR prostate brachytherapy. The demonstrated immediate increase in self-reported confidence suggests that trainees can become better prepared and more comfortable with the procedure, potentially leading to improved procedural accuracy, reduced errors, and enhanced clinical outcomes in patient care, as well as contributing to standardized training protocols.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily reports on 'immediate gains in self-reported confidence' and describes a 'pilot evaluation,' suggesting that long-term retention of knowledge or objective assessment of skill transfer to actual clinical performance were not evaluated. The sample sizes (N=11 for patient preparation, N=27 for needle insertion) are also relatively small.</p>

Subsequent research could investigate the long-term efficacy of the simulator, measure objective performance metrics, and assess the direct impact on clinical outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To develop a virtual reality simulator for high dose rate prostate
brachytherapy and to test whether participation is associated with immediate
gains in self-reported confidence across predefined procedural domains in two
cohorts. Methods: Two modules were developed and implemented using Unreal
Engine: patient preparation and template guided needle insertion. Oncology
staff and trainees completed pre and post surveys that assessed confidence for
recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining
equipment function. Studies were conducted at the Hands On Brachytherapy
Workshop (HOWBT) in London, Ontario, and at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre in
Toronto, Ontario. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p values
compared before and after scores within each module. Results: Patient
preparation (N=11) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002),
explaining steps (W=51, p = 0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and
explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). Needle insertion (N=27)
confidence increased for recalling steps (W=292, p<0.001), explaining steps
(W=347, p<0.001), identifying equipment (W=355, p<0.001), and explaining
equipment function (W=354, p<0.001). Conclusion: The simulator was feasible to
deploy and was associated with higher self-reported confidence across key
domains immediately after training. Findings may inform future curriculum
design and implementation work.</p>
