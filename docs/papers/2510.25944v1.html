                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper details the development and pilot evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) simulator designed for high dose rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy. The study demonstrates that participation in two VR modules‚Äîpatient preparation and template guided needle insertion‚Äîis associated with immediate, statistically significant gains in self-reported confidence among oncology staff and trainees across key procedural domains.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a Virtual Reality (VR) simulator, which is a direct technological *application* in health for medical training. While the abstract does not explicitly mention Artificial Intelligence (AI) components within the VR system, VR itself serves as a significant 'medical application' of technology, fitting the broader 'medical AI/applications' category.</p>

                    <li>A VR simulator was developed for HDR prostate brachytherapy, featuring two modules: patient preparation and template-guided needle insertion.</li>
                    
                    <li>The simulator was built using Unreal Engine, leveraging modern game development technology for realistic rendering and interaction.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Two VR modules, patient preparation and template guided needle insertion, were developed using Unreal Engine. Oncology staff and trainees participated in a pilot evaluation conducted at the Hands On Brachytherapy Workshop and Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre. Self-reported confidence was measured using pre and post-training surveys for recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining equipment function. Statistical analysis involved paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p-values to compare before and after scores within each module.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Significant immediate gains in self-reported confidence were observed across all predefined procedural domains after participation in both VR modules. For patient preparation (N=11), confidence increased significantly for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002), explaining steps (W=51, p=0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). For needle insertion (N=27), even stronger increases were found across all domains (W=292-355, all p<0.001).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The development and successful pilot evaluation of this VR simulator offer a valuable tool for training radiation oncology professionals in HDR prostate brachytherapy. By enhancing confidence and potentially procedural knowledge in a low-risk virtual environment, it could shorten the learning curve, improve the quality of patient care by better-prepared staff, and standardize training protocols for a technically demanding procedure.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study's primary limitation is its reliance on self-reported confidence as an outcome measure, rather than objective skill assessment or performance metrics. It was a pilot evaluation with relatively small sample sizes (N=11 and N=27), and immediate gains in confidence do not necessarily correlate with long-term retention or actual procedural competence in a clinical setting.</p>

                <p>The findings are intended to inform future curriculum design and implementation work. Future research should include objective skill assessment, larger-scale studies, evaluation of long-term knowledge retention, and assessment of the simulator's impact on clinical performance and patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To develop a virtual reality simulator for high dose rate prostate
brachytherapy and to test whether participation is associated with immediate
gains in self-reported confidence across predefined procedural domains in two
cohorts. Methods: Two modules were developed and implemented using Unreal
Engine: patient preparation and template guided needle insertion. Oncology
staff and trainees completed pre and post surveys that assessed confidence for
recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining
equipment function. Studies were conducted at the Hands On Brachytherapy
Workshop (HOWBT) in London, Ontario, and at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre in
Toronto, Ontario. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p values
compared before and after scores within each module. Results: Patient
preparation (N=11) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002),
explaining steps (W=51, p = 0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and
explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). Needle insertion (N=27)
confidence increased for recalling steps (W=292, p<0.001), explaining steps
(W=347, p<0.001), identifying equipment (W=355, p<0.001), and explaining
equipment function (W=354, p<0.001). Conclusion: The simulator was feasible to
deploy and was associated with higher self-reported confidence across key
domains immediately after training. Findings may inform future curriculum
design and implementation work.</p>
