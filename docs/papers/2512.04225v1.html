                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GOPHER, a suite of practical differential privacy (DP) mechanisms designed to release comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics while rigorously protecting participant privacy. By employing an optimization-based randomization approach and personalized priors, GOPHER significantly reduces the noise typically associated with DP in GWAS, demonstrating high accuracy on UK Biobank datasets with both real and simulated phenotypes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper utilizes 'predictive models privately trained on a subset of the dataset' to derive personalized priors.

                    <p>The study develops new differential privacy mechanisms, collectively termed GOPHER.

The efficacy and accuracy of these privacy-preserving statistics were empirically validated using both real and simulated phenotypes from various GWAS datasets within the UK Biobank.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an essential tool in biomedical research for identifying genetic factors linked to health and disease. However, publicly releasing GWAS summary statistics poses well-recognized privacy risks, including the potential to infer an individual's participation in the study or to reveal sensitive phenotypic information (e.g., disease status). While differential privacy (DP) offers a rigorous mathematical framework for mitigating these risks, existing DP techniques for GWAS either introduce excessive noise or restrict the release to a limited set of results. In this work, we present practical DP mechanisms for releasing the complete set of genome-wide association statistics with privacy guarantees. We demonstrate the accuracy of the privacy-preserving statistics released by our mechanisms on a range of GWAS datasets from the UK Biobank, utilizing both real and simulated phenotypes. We introduce two key techniques to overcome the limitations of prior approaches: (1) an optimization-based randomization mechanism that directly minimizes the expected error in GWAS results to enhance utility, and (2) the use of personalized priors, derived from predictive models privately trained on a subset of the dataset, to enable sample-specific optimization which further reduces the amount of noise introduced by DP. Overall, our work provides practical tools for accurately releasing comprehensive GWAS results with provable protection of study participants.</p>
