                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces T-FIX, a novel benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the 'expert alignment' of explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains. Recognizing the inadequacy of current evaluation metrics that focus primarily on plausibility or internal faithfulness, T-FIX formalizes the criterion of whether an LLM's explanation truly reflects and aligns with expert-level reasoning and intuition.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves formalizing 'expert alignment' as a new evaluation criterion. A benchmark called T-FIX was developed, covering seven knowledge-intensive domains. This development included direct collaboration with domain experts (e.g., doctors, psychologists) to define what constitutes expert-level reasoning and to create novel metrics specifically designed to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with these expert judgments.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is the identification and formalization of 'expert alignment' as a vital, yet currently underexplored, criterion for evaluating LLM explanations in critical domains. The paper's contribution is the creation of the T-FIX benchmark and associated novel metrics, which provide a concrete method to measure this alignment, thereby addressing a significant gap in current LLM evaluation schemes.</p>

                <p>This work has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by enabling the development and deployment of more trustworthy and usable AI tools. If LLM explanations align with a physician's expert intuition, it can lead to safer adoption of AI in diagnostics, treatment planning, and surgical support, fostering greater confidence among healthcare providers and potentially improving patient outcomes by ensuring AI insights are truly interpretable and actionable within a medical context.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract highlights the limitations of *current evaluation schemes* which primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness, rather than expert alignment. While the paper proposes a solution, the inherent challenge lies in capturing the nuanced and often subjective nature of 'expert intuition' across diverse and complex medical scenarios, which may pose challenges for the generalizability and scalability of the developed metrics.</p>

This would involve continued collaboration with domain experts to evolve the understanding of expert alignment, potentially leading to the development of LLMs that are intrinsically designed to generate expert-aligned explanations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.</p>
