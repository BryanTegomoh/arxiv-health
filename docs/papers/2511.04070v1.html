                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">T-FIX introduces a novel benchmark and metrics to evaluate the "expert alignment" of Large Language Model (LLM) explanations, addressing the critical need for explanations that resonate with domain experts in knowledge-intensive fields like medicine. This work formalizes expert alignment as a crucial evaluation criterion, moving beyond current schemes that primarily focus on plausibility or internal faithfulness, to ensure AI explanations reflect sophisticated expert-level reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.</p>
