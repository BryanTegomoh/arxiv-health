                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces T-FIX, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) explanations based on their alignment with domain expert reasoning, addressing a critical gap in current evaluation schemes that prioritize plausibility or internal faithfulness. T-FIX formalizes the criterion of "expert alignment" and proposes new, expert-developed metrics to measure this crucial aspect across seven knowledge-intensive domains, including medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves formalizing "expert alignment" as a key criterion for evaluating LLM explanations. The authors then developed novel, domain-specific metrics in collaboration with domain experts to quantitatively measure this alignment. These metrics are integrated into the T-FIX benchmark, which spans seven knowledge-intensive domains, to assess how well LLM explanations reflect expert judgment.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is the successful formalization of "expert alignment" as a crucial, previously overlooked, evaluation criterion for LLM explanations. The paper establishes T-FIX, a new benchmark equipped with novel, expert-developed metrics, to accurately measure this alignment, thereby providing a superior method for evaluating LLMs intended for expert use compared to existing plausibility or faithfulness-focused schemes.</p>

                <p>By ensuring that LLM explanations in medical contexts are genuinely aligned with expert clinical reasoning, T-FIX can significantly enhance the trustworthiness, utility, and adoption of AI systems in healthcare. This could lead to more effective clinical decision support, better understanding of AI recommendations by medical professionals, improved patient safety, and more robust training tools for future clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.</p>
