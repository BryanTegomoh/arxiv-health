                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BiPETE, a novel Transformer Encoder model designed for single-disease risk prediction from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). BiPETE uniquely integrates dual positional embeddings (rotary for relative timing and sinusoidal for visit order) to effectively model temporal dependencies in irregular EHR data. The model demonstrates significant performance improvements in predicting Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder (ASUD) risk, while offering interpretable insights into key clinical risk and protective factors.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a powerful, interpretable tool for early identification of individuals at high risk for alcohol and substance use disorders using existing EHR data. Such proactive risk assessment can facilitate timely clinical interventions, personalized prevention strategies, and targeted resource allocation, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the development of BiPETE, a Transformer-based deep learning model, to predict the risk of Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder (ASUD) in patients using their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It's designed to identify individuals at high risk, particularly those with existing mental health conditions like depression and PTSD. Furthermore, the model's interpretability feature identifies specific clinical markers (e.g., inflammatory, hematologic, metabolic markers, medications, comorbidities) that contribute to ASUD risk, providing valuable insights for clinicians to understand and potentially mitigate these risks, thus supporting personalized early intervention and risk management strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.</p>
