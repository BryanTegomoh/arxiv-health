                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Geographically-Dependent Individual-Level Models (GD-ILMs), an extension of existing discrete-time individual-level models (ILMs), to incorporate the effect of spatial location itself on infectious disease transmission, rather than just spatial separation. These models allow for the evaluation of spatially varying risk factors and unobserved spatial structure using a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model, aiming to formulate etiological hypotheses and identify high-risk geographical regions.</p>

                <p>The research develops advanced computational models using a Bayesian statistical framework with MCMC methods to analyze complex health data for prediction and risk assessment. While the methodology is rooted in statistics and computational epidemiology rather than explicitly 'AI' in the modern machine learning sense, the application directly aligns with the goals of AI in health: providing data-driven insights for disease prediction, identifying high-risk populations/regions, and informing public health interventions. This framework could be integrated into or augment AI-driven surveillance and decision-support systems for public health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Infectious disease models can be of great use for understanding the underlying mechanisms that influence the spread of diseases and predicting future disease progression. Modeling has been increasingly used to evaluate the potential impact of different control measures and to guide public health policy decisions. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in developing spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and an example of such recent developments is the discrete time individual-level models (ILMs). These models are well developed and provide a common framework for modeling many disease systems, however, they assume the probability of disease transmission between two individuals depends only on their spatial separation and not on their spatial locations. In cases where spatial location itself is important for understanding the spread of emerging infectious diseases and identifying their causes, it would be beneficial to incorporate the effect of spatial location in the model. In this study, we thus generalize the ILMs to a new class of geographically-dependent ILMs (GD-ILMs), to allow for the evaluation of the effect of spatially varying risk factors (e.g., education, environmental), as well as unobserved spatial structure, upon the transmission of infectious disease. Specifically, we consider a conditional autoregressive model to capture the effects of unobserved spatially structured latent covariates or measurement error. This results in flexible infectious disease models that can be used for formulating etiological hypotheses and identifying geographical regions of unusually high risk to formulate preventive action. The reliability of these models are investigated on a combination of simulated epidemic data and Alberta seasonal influenza outbreak data (2009). This new class of models is fitted to data within a Bayesian statistical framework using MCMC methods.</p>
