                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces Geographically-Dependent Individual-Level Models (GD-ILMs), an advancement over traditional individual-level models (ILMs), to explicitly incorporate the impact of spatial location on infectious disease transmission. By integrating a conditional autoregressive model, GD-ILMs allow for the evaluation of spatially varying risk factors and unobserved spatial structures, enhancing the understanding of disease spread and facilitating the identification of high-risk geographical regions for targeted interventions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research significantly enhances infectious disease modeling by providing a robust framework to identify geographical hotspots and spatially varying risk factors, which is crucial for targeted public health interventions, resource allocation, and a deeper understanding of disease etiology and epidemiology.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper develops geographically-dependent individual-level models (GD-ILMs) using a Bayesian statistical framework and MCMC methods to understand and predict infectious disease spread. While not employing common 'AI' terminology like machine learning or deep learning, these advanced computational statistical models contribute directly to public health informatics and predictive analytics for health. They can serve as a foundational analytical component for AI-driven public health surveillance systems, early warning systems for epidemics, and data-driven decision support tools used by health authorities to implement targeted interventions and formulate preventive actions in specific high-risk geographical regions. The aim to 'predict future disease progression' and 'identify geographical regions of unusually high risk' aligns with key applications of AI in health analytics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Infectious disease models can be of great use for understanding the underlying mechanisms that influence the spread of diseases and predicting future disease progression. Modeling has been increasingly used to evaluate the potential impact of different control measures and to guide public health policy decisions. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in developing spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and an example of such recent developments is the discrete time individual-level models (ILMs). These models are well developed and provide a common framework for modeling many disease systems, however, they assume the probability of disease transmission between two individuals depends only on their spatial separation and not on their spatial locations. In cases where spatial location itself is important for understanding the spread of emerging infectious diseases and identifying their causes, it would be beneficial to incorporate the effect of spatial location in the model. In this study, we thus generalize the ILMs to a new class of geographically-dependent ILMs (GD-ILMs), to allow for the evaluation of the effect of spatially varying risk factors (e.g., education, environmental), as well as unobserved spatial structure, upon the transmission of infectious disease. Specifically, we consider a conditional autoregressive model to capture the effects of unobserved spatially structured latent covariates or measurement error. This results in flexible infectious disease models that can be used for formulating etiological hypotheses and identifying geographical regions of unusually high risk to formulate preventive action. The reliability of these models are investigated on a combination of simulated epidemic data and Alberta seasonal influenza outbreak data (2009). This new class of models is fitted to data within a Bayesian statistical framework using MCMC methods.</p>
