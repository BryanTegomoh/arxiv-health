                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study systematically investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models against distribution shifts caused by variations in MRI protocols, segmentation, and inter-observer variability. Using a fruit phantom, it demonstrates that models trained on protocol-invariant features maintain high performance, while dataset augmentation significantly improves uncertainty calibration. The findings establish a framework for developing robust radiomics models for real-world clinical deployment.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a phantom comprising 16 fruits to systematically evaluate distribution shifts. Data was acquired using five distinct MRI sequences (T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, T2-FLAIR) to simulate protocol variations. Additional distribution shifts were introduced through varied segmentation strategies (full, partial, rotated) and inter-observer variability. XGBoost classifiers were trained and evaluated on two sets of radiomics features: 8 consistent, protocol-invariant features and all sequence-specific features. Model performance was assessed using F1-scores under both in-domain and out-of-domain conditions. The quality of uncertainty estimates was evaluated using metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and methods such as dataset augmentation and temperature scaling were applied to improve calibration.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Models trained on 8 protocol-invariant radiomics features demonstrated superior robustness, maintaining F1-scores >0.85 across various distribution shifts. In contrast, models using all features experienced a significant 40% performance degradation under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality of uncertainty estimates and reduced the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 35%, crucially without sacrificing predictive accuracy. XGBoost classifiers showed inherent reliability in calibration, as temperature scaling provided only minimal additional calibration benefits. The research concludes that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies are effective strategies for predicting and mitigating model behavior under real-world distribution shifts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.</p>
