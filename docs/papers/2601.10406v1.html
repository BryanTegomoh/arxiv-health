                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ErrEval, an Error-aware Evaluation framework designed to improve automatic Question Generation (QG) evaluation by explicitly identifying and diagnosing critical defects like factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. ErrEval employs a two-stage process involving an Error Identifier and informed LLM evaluators, demonstrating enhanced alignment with human judgments and effectively mitigating the overestimation of low-quality questions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate Question Generation (QG) is vital in medicine for applications like patient education, clinical decision support, and medical training. Defects like factual hallucinations or answer mismatches, if propagated, could lead to severe consequences such as incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate treatments, or patient misinformation, making robust, error-aware evaluation crucial for medical AI tools.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>ErrEval enhances the reliability and safety of medical AI applications that employ Question Generation (QG). By providing an error-aware evaluation framework, it ensures that QG systems used in healthcare contexts—such as generating accurate assessment questions for medical students, creating patient-friendly explanations from complex medical records, or assisting clinicians in formulating relevant questions for diagnostic processes—produce high-quality, factually grounded questions. This directly mitigates risks associated with misinformation or hallucination, which are particularly dangerous in critical healthcare scenarios, thereby improving the trustworthiness and effectiveness of AI in medicine.</p>

                    <p>ErrEval operates as a two-stage evaluation framework.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research can lead to more reliable and safer AI-generated content in clinical settings. By preventing the overestimation of flawed questions, ErrEval can help ensure that AI tools generating educational materials for patients or medical students, or supporting clinical decisions with Q&A, produce highly accurate and contextually relevant questions. This reduces the risk of disseminating misinformation, improves the quality of medical training, and enhances the trustworthiness of AI in healthcare, potentially saving clinicians time in verifying AI outputs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.</p>
