                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ErrEval, an Error-aware Evaluation framework designed to address critical defects like factual hallucinations and answer mismatches in automatic Question Generation (QG) outputs, which are often overlooked by existing black-box evaluation methods. ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process: explicit error diagnosis by a lightweight identifier, followed by informed scoring using LLM evaluators guided by these diagnostic signals. Experiments show ErrEval significantly improves alignment with human judgments and effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality generated questions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Question Generation models have significant potential in medicine for applications like medical education (generating quiz questions), clinical decision support (formulating diagnostic queries from patient data), and patient information systems. The accuracy and reliability of these generated questions are paramount in healthcare, as defects like factual hallucinations or answer mismatches could lead to severe consequences, including misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, or patient misinformation.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more robust evaluation framework for AI systems that generate questions or information in healthcare settings. It enhances the reliability and safety of medical AI applications by ensuring that generated content, crucial for tasks like medical training or patient information, is factually accurate and free from critical defects.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.</p>
