                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">ErrEval is an error-aware evaluation framework designed to improve automatic Question Generation (QG) assessment by explicitly diagnosing critical defects like factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. It employs a two-stage process involving a dedicated error identifier and subsequent informed LLM-based scoring, demonstrating enhanced alignment with human judgments and effectively mitigating the overestimation of low-quality generated questions. This approach addresses the limitations of existing black-box evaluation methods that often overlook significant errors.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In medical and health contexts, the accuracy and reliability of information are paramount. AI-generated questions, if critically flawed by factual hallucinations or answer mismatches, could lead to severe misinformation for patients, misguidance for clinicians, or ineffective learning in medical education. ErrEval's ability to explicitly detect and mitigate these critical errors ensures higher trustworthiness and safety for AI applications leveraging Question Generation in healthcare.</p>

                <p>An AI application in health could use QG to automatically create study questions for medical students from textbooks or clinical cases, generate FAQs for patients about their conditions or treatments, or assist clinicians by formulating precise questions to query large medical knowledge bases or electronic health records for diagnostic or treatment guidance. ErrEval would serve as a critical component in validating the quality and factual accuracy of the questions generated by such medical AI systems, thereby enhancing their reliability and mitigating risks associated with inaccurate or misleading information.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.</p>
