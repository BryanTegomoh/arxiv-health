                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BEBMS, a novel principled Bayesian event-based model, designed to accurately infer disease subtypes and progression stages in chronic conditions characterized by structured heterogeneity. The study demonstrates that BEBMS significantly outperforms the widely used SuStaIn model across synthetic data experiments with varying misspecification levels, and yields results more consistent with scientific consensus when applied to real-world Alzheimer's disease data.</p>

                    <li>The existing SuStaIn (Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model) is widely used to estimate disease subtypes, progression order for each, and patient assignment from cross-sectional data, but its robustness is a concern.</li>

                    <li>BEBMS's performance was rigorously compared against SuStaIn using a variety of synthetic datasets, systematically varying levels of model misspecification.</li>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Chronic diseases often progress differently across patients. Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.</p>
