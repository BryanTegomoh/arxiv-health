                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SMB-Structure, a novel 'world model' paradigm for structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) designed to simulate patient dynamics rather than merely summarizing them as static documents. It combines a Joint-Embedding Prediction Architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT) to learn embeddings that capture complex disease trajectories. Validated across oncology and pulmonary embolism cohorts, the model demonstrates superior capture of disease dynamics compared to autoregressive baselines, achieving competitive performance on heterogeneous patient tasks.</p>

                    <p>The study develops SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR data. Its training paradigm integrates two components: a Joint-Embedding Prediction Architecture (JEPA), which predicts future patient states in a latent embedding space from an initial patient representation, and next-token prediction (Supervised Fine-Tuning - SFT), which reconstructs future patient states in the token space. Model performance was evaluated using linear probes on the learned embeddings at various points along disease trajectories and compared against autoregressive baselines across large oncology and pulmonary embolism patient cohorts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.
