                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SMB-Structure, a novel 'world model' paradigm for structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) that simulates patient dynamics rather than merely predicting next tokens. By integrating a Joint-Embedding Prediction Architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT), the model learns embeddings that capture disease trajectories, outperforming autoregressive baselines and achieving competitive performance on complex tasks in large oncology and pulmonary embolism cohorts.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SMB-Structure is a 'world model' for structured EHR that integrates a Joint-Embedding Prediction Architecture (JEPA) with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). SFT aims to reconstruct future patient states in their tokenized EHR format, similar to traditional next-token prediction. Concurrently, JEPA is trained to predict these future states in a compact latent space, conditioned solely on the initial patient representation. This dual-objective forces the model to learn and encode the underlying trajectory dynamics and evolve the patient's state in its latent representation *before* the subsequent observations are actually made. The model was validated using a linear probe on embeddings extracted at various points along disease trajectories within two large, real-world clinical datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.
