                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces AerialMind, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) scenarios, addressing the current limitation of RMOT research primarily being confined to ground-level environments. It proposes an innovative semi-automated annotation framework called COALA to efficiently build the dataset and a novel method, HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), to enhance vision-language representation learning for improved perception in UAV contexts. The research aims to bridge a critical gap, enabling intelligent aerial systems to perform precise object detection and tracking using natural language instructions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>AI-powered UAVs capable of precise object tracking via natural language commands can be applied to health for: search and rescue operations (locating missing persons or injured individuals), remote assessment of health crises (e.g., in inaccessible areas), targeted delivery of medical supplies or vaccines, and surveillance for epidemiological control or biosecurity threats. For example, a medical AI could direct a UAV to 'track the person in the red shirt near the accident site' or 'monitor the crowd movement in zone B for signs of distress', significantly enhancing situational awareness and response efficiency in health-related emergencies.</p>

                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the *gap* in existing RMOT research (confined to ground-level scenarios) rather than explicit limitations of their own work. However, the mention of the 'challenging nature of our dataset' implies inherent complexities in UAV scenarios (e.g., variable object scales, occlusions, complex backgrounds from an aerial perspective) that even advanced methods like HETrack must contend with, indicating that further research is needed to fully master these challenges.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.</p>
