                    <p>The authors propose two complementary tools:
1.  **Intervention Efficiency (IE):** A capacity-aware metric that links a model's predictive performance to its clinical utility by quantifying the efficiency of identifying actionable true positives under predefined intervention limits or budgets.
2.  **Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF):** A structured methodology for systematically assessing a model's stability by evaluating how its performance changes (or remains invariant) across various perturbed validation datasets, simulating noise or data shifts.
These tools were empirically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world healthcare datasets to demonstrate their effectiveness in robust model selection.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings indicate that employing the Intervention Efficiency (IE) metric alongside the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF) facilitates the selection of clinical models that exhibit superior generalization robustness. Furthermore, these selected models demonstrate a stronger alignment with practical clinical capacity constraints and operational priorities, making them more suitable for real-world deployment than models chosen by conventional metrics. This approach provides a new direction for effectively mitigating the challenges of the Rashomon Effect in clinical machine learning.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has the potential to significantly improve the reliability and utility of clinical AI deployments. By enabling the selection of models that are robust to data variability and aligned with resource limitations, it can lead to more trustworthy diagnostic, prognostic, and interventional support systems. This can optimize resource allocation, reduce the risk of deploying unstable or impractical models, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes within the existing constraints of healthcare systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.</p>
