                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a modular, rule-based framework to approximate Banff scores. It decomposed specific Banff indicators (e.g., glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis, intimal arteritis) into their constituent structural and inflammatory components.

Model outputs were subsequently mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths.</p>

                    <p>The research demonstrated partial successes in approximating Banff scores but also identified critical failure modes of current AI models, including structural omission (missing elements), hallucination (detecting non-existent elements), and detection ambiguity. Crucially, even when final AI scores matched expert annotations, inconsistencies in the intermediate representations undermined interpretability, highlighting a significant limitation in replicating computational expert-level grading.</p>

                <p>Successfully automating Banff scoring with AI could lead to more standardized and consistent evaluation of renal transplant biopsies, reducing variability among pathologists. This improved consistency would facilitate more accurate and timely diagnosis of transplant rejection and other complications, ultimately supporting better-informed clinical decisions, optimized treatment strategies, and improved patient outcomes for renal transplant recipients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.</p>
