                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a modular, rule-based framework where Banff indicators (like g, ptc, v) were decomposed into elementary structural and inflammatory components. Existing deep learning models for segmentation and detection were used to identify these components from biopsy images.

Performance was evaluated by comparing these AI-generated scores and intermediate representations against expert-annotated ground truths.</p>

                    <p>The AI models achieved partial successes in approximating Banff scores but suffered from critical failure modes including structural omission, hallucination of features, and ambiguous detection of lesions. Even when final Banff scores matched expert annotations, the underlying intermediate representations from the AI were often inconsistent, indicating a lack of robust understanding and limiting interpretability. These results collectively demonstrate the current limitations of AI in fully replicating expert-level computational grading in transplant pathology.</p>

                <p>The findings underscore the challenges in deploying fully autonomous AI for critical diagnostic tasks like Banff scoring, but also lay the groundwork for developing AI-assisted tools that could reduce pathologist workload and standardize reporting. By pinpointing specific AI failure modes, this research can guide the creation of more accurate and clinically trustworthy AI systems, ultimately leading to more consistent and potentially improved patient care following renal transplantation.</p>

A significant limitation is the inconsistency found in AI's intermediate representations, which undermines the interpretability and reliability of even correctly predicted final scores.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.</p>
