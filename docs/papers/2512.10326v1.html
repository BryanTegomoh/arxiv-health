                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces StainNet, a specialized Vision Transformer-based foundation model designed for computational pathology analysis of special staining images. Unlike existing models pre-trained primarily on H&E stains, StainNet utilizes a self-distillation self-supervised learning approach on a vast dataset of over 1.4 million special stain patches. It demonstrates strong performance in various tasks, including liver malignancy classification, ROI analysis, few-shot learning, and retrieval, outperforming H&E-centric models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.</p>
