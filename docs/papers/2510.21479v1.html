                    <p>The methodology centers on a dual-stream deep learning architecture. One stream processes macroscale tissue features, while the other aggregates fine-grained cell-level representations. A core component is the 'receptance-weighted key-value aggregation' (RWKV) model, which is a recurrent transformer designed for efficient, linear-complexity processing of large sets of cellular features and modeling inter-cell dependencies. Additionally, a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module facilitates cross-attention and information exchange between cellular cues and their surrounding tissue context.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.</p>
