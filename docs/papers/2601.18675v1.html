                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the ability of temporal embedding models, specifically recurrent neural networks, to learn clinically meaningful and task-agnostic representations from longitudinal electronic health records of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. It demonstrates that the Time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) produces superior, more structured embeddings for CKD stage classification. Furthermore, learning embeddings as an intermediate step consistently outperforms direct end-to-end prediction for in-ICU mortality, indicating a more effective approach for clinical predictive tasks.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized the MIMIC-IV dataset, specifically focusing on patients diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease. It employed a comparative analysis of three recurrent neural network architectures: a vanilla Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), an attention-augmented LSTM, and a Time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). Each model was trained in two configurations: as an embedding model (generating intermediate representations) and as a direct end-to-end predictor. Embedding quality was assessed using CKD stage clustering (quantified by Davies-Bouldin Index and classification accuracy) and the models' performance on an in-ICU mortality prediction task.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate whether temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records can learn clinically meaningful representations without compromising predictive performance, and how architectural choices affect embedding quality. Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning.</p>
