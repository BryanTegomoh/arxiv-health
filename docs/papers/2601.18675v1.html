                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the effectiveness of temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. It demonstrates that a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) learns more structured and clinically meaningful representations, and that learning embeddings as an intermediate step significantly improves predictive performance for tasks like in-ICU mortality compared to direct end-to-end models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work addresses the crucial need for transparent and generalizable representations of patient disease dynamics from EHRs, which can enhance clinical prediction models by moving beyond single-task optimization to support model-guided medicine and improve understanding of complex conditions like CKD.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is to develop advanced machine learning models (specifically temporal embedding models) that can extract clinically meaningful, transparent, and task-agnostic representations from complex, longitudinal electronic health records. These representations can then be used to improve the accuracy and generalizability of downstream medical prediction tasks, such as classifying disease stages (e.g., CKD stages) and predicting critical patient outcomes (e.g., in-ICU mortality), thereby supporting 'model-guided medicine' and clinical decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate whether temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records can learn clinically meaningful representations without compromising predictive performance, and how architectural choices affect embedding quality. Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning.</p>
