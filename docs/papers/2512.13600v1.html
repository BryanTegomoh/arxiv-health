                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DA-SSL, a domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor designed to overcome limitations of Pathology Foundational Models (PFMs) when applied to challenging histopathology slides like transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) specimens. DA-SSL efficiently realigns PFM features to the target domain without fine-tuning the foundational model. Piloting this framework for predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treatment response in bladder cancer, the authors demonstrate its effectiveness with strong performance metrics, enhancing the applicability of AI in clinically complex scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for improving personalized medicine in bladder cancer by enabling AI models to accurately predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response from real-world, often challenging, biopsy slides. This can help clinicians make informed treatment decisions, optimize patient outcomes, and potentially reduce unnecessary treatments for patients unlikely to benefit.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a deep learning system designed to adapt existing pathology foundational models (PFMs) to analyze challenging histopathology slides from TURBT procedures. The system aims to assist pathologists and clinicians in two key areas: improving the accuracy of diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer and, more critically, predicting which patients with bladder cancer will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This application directly supports clinical decision-making, potentially leading to more personalized and effective cancer treatment strategies.</p>

                    <p>The study proposes DA-SSL, a domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor, to realign features from pre-trained Pathology Foundational Models (PFMs) to a target domain (TURBT histopathology slides).

                <p>The DA-SSL framework has the potential to significantly improve the stratification of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). By providing more accurate predictions of treatment response, it can facilitate personalized treatment decisions, ensuring that patients receive optimal therapy, minimizing overtreatment, and potentially improving survival rates and quality of life for MIBC patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent deep learning frameworks in histopathology, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL) combined with pathology foundational models (PFMs), have shown strong performance. However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.
