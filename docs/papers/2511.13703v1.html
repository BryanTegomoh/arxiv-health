                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper demonstrates that generalist foundation models are insufficient for critical hospital operational tasks, proposing Lang1, a family of specialized models pretrained on a blend of clinical EHR and internet data. Lang1, especially after supervised finetuning on real-world clinical benchmarks, significantly outperforms generalist models in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the necessity of in-domain pretraining and practical evaluation for effective healthcare AI.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for improving the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and quality of care in healthcare systems by providing more accurate predictive tools for critical operational decisions, directly impacting patient outcomes and resource allocation within hospitals.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper focuses on developing specialized generalist foundation models (Lang1) specifically for hospital operations. These AI models are applied to predict crucial clinical and operational outcomes like patient mortality and readmission risk, manage patient flow by predicting length of stay, assist with medical billing and documentation through comorbidity coding, and improve financial efficiency by predicting insurance claims denial. The goal is to enhance AI capabilities for more effective and efficient healthcare system management and patient care.</p>

                    <li>Generalist foundation models, despite strong medical knowledge, lack the specialized operational knowledge required for critical hospital decisions like patient flow, cost, and quality of care.</li>
                    
                    <li>Introduced Lang1, a family of specialized language models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a blended corpus of 80 billion clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health EHRs and 627 billion internet tokens.</li>
                    
                    <li>Developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE) benchmark using 668,331 EHR notes, evaluating five critical hospital operational tasks: 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and insurance claims denial prediction.</li>
                    
                    <li>In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperformed on four of five ReMedE tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with 30-day mortality prediction being the only exception.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study introduced Lang1, a family of language models pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B internet tokens. It developed the ReMedE benchmark from 668,331 EHR notes, comprising five critical predictive tasks. Evaluation was conducted in both zero-shot settings and after supervised finetuning, comparing Lang1 models against general-purpose models, primarily using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) as the performance metric. Cross-task scaling and out-of-distribution transferability were also assessed.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Generalist models perform poorly on most real-world hospital operational tasks in zero-shot settings. Specialized models like Lang1, particularly after supervised finetuning, dramatically outperform larger generalist models, demonstrating significant AUROC improvements (e.g., 3.64%-6.75% over finetuned generalists). In-domain pretraining on EHR data coupled with supervised finetuning is critical for achieving high predictive accuracy, cross-task generalization, and out-of-distribution transferability for complex clinical operational challenges.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The development and validation of specialized LLMs like Lang1 provide healthcare systems with more reliable tools for predicting critical operational outcomes (e.g., readmission, mortality, length of stay). This can lead to improved resource allocation, proactive patient interventions, reduced costs associated with adverse events, and enhanced overall quality of care, ultimately facilitating more efficient and patient-centered hospital operations.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the presented work. However, potential implicit limitations could include that the primary clinical pretraining data originated from a single institution (NYU Langone Health), which might limit generalizability without further validation, and the models, while effective, are still of moderate size (up to 7B parameters) compared to the largest generalist LLMs.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The findings support the continued development and rigorous real-world evaluation of specialized LLMs for healthcare. Future research should focus on further exploring the optimal combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning techniques, and comprehensive real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks to develop robust and effective AI systems for diverse healthcare operational challenges.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.</p>
