                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SISTA, a novel multi-level alignment framework for medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) that addresses the common issue of false negatives in contrastive learning. By incorporating inter-report semantic similarity and aligning image patches with relevant word tokens, SISTA learns more robust representations. This approach significantly improves performance across various downstream tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and object detection, particularly demonstrating effectiveness with limited labeled data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SISTA employs a multi-level alignment framework. At the instance (image-report) level, it improves conventional contrastive learning by explicitly incorporating inter-report semantic similarity to identify and filter out false negative pairs. At the fine-grained (patch-word) level, it introduces a novel mechanism to effectively align specific regions of medical images (patches) with corresponding descriptive word tokens from the associated radiology reports, ensuring a more semantically aware representation learning process.</p>

This directly translates to improved diagnostic tools for radiologists, more precise detection and segmentation of abnormalities (e.g., tumors, lesions), and enhanced assistance in disease classification, potentially leading to earlier, more efficient, and more effective patient care, especially in data-scarce medical domains.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.</p>
