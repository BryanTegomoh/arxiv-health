                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework combining Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM) to improve time-series counterfactual outcome estimation. SGA enhances deconfounding by aligning fine-grained sub-treatment groups, while RTM promotes temporal generalization and robustness by encouraging reliance on stable historical patterns. Their synergistic application achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling more effective decision-making in dynamic medical settings by better handling evolving confounders and improving temporal stability.</p>

                    <p>The proposed framework integrates two key components: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). SGA employs an iterative process of treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups within the latent representation, followed by aligning their distributions to achieve improved deconfounding. RTM is a regularization technique where input covariates at random time steps are replaced with Gaussian noise during training, forcing the model to depend less on potentially noisy current observations and more on stable historical patterns to foster temporal generalization.</p>

                    <p>The study found that both SGA and RTM individually enhance counterfactual outcome estimation. The synergistic combination of SGA and RTM consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance. SGA was theoretically proven to optimize a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk, with its deconfounding efficacy empirically verified. The combined approach's success stems from SGA's ability to precisely deconfound at each time point, effectively managing evolving confounders, while RTM ensures temporal generalization and robustness across time steps by leveraging stable historical patterns.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.</p>
