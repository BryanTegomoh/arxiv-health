                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed framework integrates two novel components: 1) **Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA)**, an iterative process that applies treatment-agnostic clustering to identify and align fine-grained sub-treatment groups in the latent space. This approach aims to achieve superior distributional matching across treatment groups, thereby more effectively mitigating the confounding effects of time-evolving variables. SGA is theoretically shown to optimize a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk. 2) **Random Temporal Masking (RTM)**, a regularization technique where input covariates are randomly replaced with Gaussian noise during training. This encourages the model to learn more robust representations by relying less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated current-step covariates and more on stable historical patterns, improving temporal generalization and preserving causal relationships.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The key findings indicate that both Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM) individually contribute to improved counterfactual outcome estimation. SGA was theoretically proven to optimize a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically validated for its deconfounding efficacy. Crucially, the synergistic combination of SGA and RTM consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance. This success is attributed to their complementary roles: SGA effectively addresses deconfounding at each specific time point, while RTM enhances temporal generalization and overall robustness across different time steps.</p>

Clinicians could leverage this framework to precisely determine the optimal timing for administering treatments, personalize therapeutic adjustments based on evolving patient states, and anticipate the long-term impact of medical decisions, ultimately leading to more effective interventions, reduced adverse events, and improved patient outcomes in dynamic healthcare settings like the ICU.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.</p>
