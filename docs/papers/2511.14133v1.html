                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Synthetic Survival Control (SSC), a novel methodology extending synthetic control methods to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories for time-to-event outcomes from observational data. Addressing challenges like censoring and non-random treatment assignment, SSC estimates how event timing would change under intervention by weighting observed trajectories of control units. The authors validate SSC using a multi-country cancer dataset, demonstrating that access to new therapies is associated with improved survival (lower hazard) compared to synthetic controls.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research presents a machine learning-based causal inference method (Synthetic Survival Control) to analyze observational clinical data. This method can be applied to evaluate the counterfactual impact of medical interventions (e.g., new therapies, policy changes) on patient survival and other time-to-event outcomes. It provides a tool for evidence-based medicine, informing treatment evaluation, clinical decision support, and health policy assessment by predicting 'what-if' scenarios regarding treatment timing and outcomes.</p>

                <p>SSC provides clinicians, researchers, and policymakers with an advanced statistical tool to more reliably assess the real-world effectiveness of new medical treatments, drugs, or policy interventions on patient survival using existing observational data. This can accelerate evidence generation, inform treatment guidelines, aid in drug development decisions, and guide resource allocation in healthcare systems, particularly valuable for conditions where randomized trials are difficult to conduct.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.</p>
