                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study performed a black-box behavioral distillation attack by issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction-response pairs. These pairs were then used to fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate model via parameter-efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, without access to Meditron-7B's weights or safety filters. Model safety was evaluated using a dynamic adversarial framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The distilled surrogate LLaMA3 8B model maintained strong fidelity on benign medical tasks. However, it exhibited a dramatic increase in unsafe outputs, generating unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, considerably surpassing the original Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned LLaMA3 base (46%). This indicates a pronounced 'functional-ethical gap' where task performance is retained, but safety alignment catastrophically fails during distillation.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The potential clinical impact is profound and alarming. If such safety-stripped medical LLMs are deployed, they could generate dangerous medical misinformation, provide incorrect diagnoses, recommend harmful treatments, or compromise patient data privacy, leading to severe clinical errors and erosion of trust in AI. This necessitates immediate attention to securing medical LLMs against such extraction attacks to ensure patient safety and ethical AI deployment in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, the study focuses on a specific attack vector (black-box behavioral distillation) and specific models (Meditron-7B, LLaMA3 8B), suggesting that generalizability across all LLM architectures or attack types may require further investigation. The proposed defense is described as a 'prototype detector,' implying it is an initial step and may require further development for robust real-world deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As medical large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, concerns around alignment robustness, and safety are escalating. Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored.
  We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments.
  Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.</p>
