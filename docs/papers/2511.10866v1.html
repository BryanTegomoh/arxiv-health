                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The paper introduces a Short-Window Sliding Learning (SW-SL) framework designed for real-time violence detection in CCTV footage, departing from conventional long-video training methods. It leverages LLM-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets from 1-2 second video clips, ensuring temporal continuity for precise recognition of rapid violent events. The proposed method achieves a high accuracy of 95.25% on the RWF-2000 dataset and significantly improves performance on long videos (83.25% on UCF-Crime), demonstrating strong generalization and real-time applicability for intelligent surveillance.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves a Short-Window Sliding Learning (SW-SL) framework. This framework segments continuous video streams into short 1-2 second clips. For each of these short clips, an LLM-based auto-captioning system is employed to generate detailed, fine-grained labels, thereby creating a rich and precisely annotated dataset. The model is trained on these short, densely labeled clips, ensuring that all frames contribute to preserving temporal continuity, which is crucial for accurately recognizing rapid and transient violent events. This approach directly contrasts with traditional methods that typically train on longer, less granular video segments.</p>

                    <p>The research successfully developed a real-time violence detection system demonstrating high efficacy and generalization. It achieved an accuracy of 95.25% on the RWF-2000 dataset, a standard benchmark for violence detection. Furthermore, the method significantly improved performance on challenging long video sequences, yielding 83.25% accuracy on the UCF-Crime dataset. These findings affirm the framework's robust capabilities for precise, real-time detection and its practical applicability in diverse surveillance scenarios.</p>

                <p>This technology could revolutionize safety protocols in healthcare by providing proactive alerts for escalating situations or violent incidents, enabling immediate staff intervention. This could lead to a reduction in injuries to patients and staff, improved de-escalation outcomes, and a safer therapeutic environment. It also offers the potential for data-driven insights into patterns of aggressive behavior within specific units (e.g., psychiatric wards, dementia care), informing better training programs, resource allocation, and individualized patient care plans aimed at preventing future incidents.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper proposes a Short-Window Sliding Learning framework for real-time violence detection in CCTV footages. Unlike conventional long-video training approaches, the proposed method divides videos into 1-2 second clips and applies Large Language Model (LLM)-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets. Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 95.25\% accuracy on RWF-2000 and significantly improves performance on long videos (UCF-Crime: 83.25\%), confirming its strong generalization and real-time applicability in intelligent surveillance systems.</p>
