                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The connectome architecture constrains tau spread, with SC and FC showing regionally asymmetric contributions. FC dominates tau spread in subcortical, insular, frontal, and temporal cortices, while SC is more influential in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. This dominance shifts over time, with FC leading in early AD and SC in later stages. These spatial patterns correlate with regional expression of AD-associated genes related to inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function. Additionally, risk factors like APOE genotype, sex, and amyloid deposition selectively reshape region-specific tau propagation pathways.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>These findings could lead to the development of improved prognostic biomarkers for AD, allowing for earlier and more accurate prediction of tauopathy progression based on individual connectome profiles. The identification of specific SC/FC pathways and their dynamic roles at different disease stages may inform precision medicine strategies for targeted therapeutic interventions or neuromodulation, optimizing treatments based on an individual's unique connectivity patterns and risk factors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.</p>
