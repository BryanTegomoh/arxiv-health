                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BrainPuzzle, a novel hybrid two-stage framework combining physics-based modeling and machine learning to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound tomography. It addresses the significant challenges of skull-induced signal degradation and impractical full-aperture arrays by utilizing reverse time migration to generate robust structural fragments, which are then fused into an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map by a transformer-based super-resolution network. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate BrainPuzzle's superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness, promising advancements in non-invasive brain imaging.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>BrainPuzzle employs a two-stage hybrid approach. The first stage uses a physics-based method, Reverse Time Migration (RTM), applied to multi-angle ultrasound acquisitions to generate initial 'migration fragments' that robustly capture structural details even with low signal-to-noise ratios.

This methodology is designed to be compatible with a practical partial-array transducer acquisition strategy.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research holds significant potential for advancing non-invasive brain imaging, offering a safer (radiation-free) and potentially more accessible and portable method for diagnosing and monitoring neurological conditions such as stroke, cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, or traumatic brain injury. Its ability to work with partial arrays could lead to more practical and cost-effective ultrasound devices for point-of-care diagnostics, reducing reliance on less accessible or more expensive imaging modalities like MRI or CT in certain clinical scenarios.</p>

Purely data-driven methods are noted to fail in accurately modeling complex nonlinear wave propagation through bone, leading to quantitatively biased SoS maps under low SNR and sparse-aperture conditions. The current validation of BrainPuzzle is exclusively on synthetic datasets, indicating a need for future experimental and clinical validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.</p>
