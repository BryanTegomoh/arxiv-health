                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR), a novel, outcome-based, and model-independent framework to quantify the therapeutic window in spatially fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT) and other advanced modalities. BPNR, defined as the ratio of total particle numbers (monitor units) required for tumor control (TCP) and normal tissue complication (NTCP), overcomes the ambiguities of traditional dose metrics, demonstrating a widened therapeutic window for proton minibeam radiotherapy (pMBRT) in a preclinical illustration.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework offers a crucial, standardized, and biologically relevant method for objectively quantifying and comparing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of novel radiation therapies. It directly addresses the challenge of evaluating complex, heterogeneous dose delivery schemes, which is vital for accelerating the translation of innovative techniques like SFRT and FLASH into clinical practice.</p>

                    <li>Conventional dose metrics (e.g., peak, valley, average dose) for heterogeneous dose distributions in SFRT are often ambiguous, inconsistent, and not uniquely linked to biological outcomes, hindering therapeutic window assessment.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR) is proposed as a new model-independent, outcome-based framework to quantify therapeutic window changes using directly measurable delivery quantities.</li>
                    
                    <li>BPNR is defined as the ratio of total particle numbers (proportional to monitor units, MU) required to achieve specified levels of Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP).</li>
                    
                    <li>The relative BPNR (RBPNR) allows for direct comparison of therapeutic windows across different radiation modalities by relying solely on biological endpoints, avoiding ambiguities from spatial dose averaging.</li>
                    
                    <li>As an illustration, the framework was applied to preclinical data comparing proton minibeam radiotherapy (pMBRT) with conventional proton therapy.</li>
                    
                    <li>The preclinical pMBRT study yielded an RBPNR > 1.4, indicating a significantly widened therapeutic window for pMBRT, largely due to the absence of normal tissue complications at the highest tested MUs.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors conceptualized and defined a novel quantitative metric, the Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR), based on the ratio of total particle numbers (proportional to Monitor Units, MU) necessary to achieve predefined levels of Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP). They introduced the relative BPNR (RBPNR) for cross-modality comparisons. The utility of this framework was then illustrated by applying it to preclinical data from a comparative study of proton minibeam radiotherapy (pMBRT) versus conventional proton therapy.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the introduction of the BPNR/RBPNR framework as a robust, model-independent, and outcome-based method for quantifying the therapeutic window in radiation therapy, overcoming limitations of traditional dose metrics. From its preclinical application, it was found that pMBRT exhibited an RBPNR > 1.4 compared to conventional proton therapy, unequivocally indicating a widened therapeutic window for pMBRT, particularly due to the observed absence of normal tissue complications at the highest MUs tested.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The BPNR/RBPNR framework has the potential to standardize the evaluation and comparison of new and complex radiation therapy modalities, such as SFRT, FLASH, and minibeam therapies. This objective quantification of therapeutic window can significantly inform clinical decision-making, optimize treatment parameters, and accelerate the safe and effective translation of innovative cancer treatments from research to patient care, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes by maximizing tumor control while minimizing normal tissue toxicity.</p>

                <p>The primary illustration of the BPNR framework in the abstract is based on preclinical data (proton minibeam radiotherapy), suggesting further validation is required with clinical data. The abstract itself does not explicitly detail inherent limitations of the BPNR methodology but rather highlights the limitations of conventional dose metrics that BPNR aims to supersede.</p>

This indicates a clear path for applying and validating the framework in diverse experimental and clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) produces highly heterogeneous dose distributions, for which conventional metrics such as peak, valley, or average dose can yield ambiguous or inconsistent estimates of therapeutic window changes. These dose descriptors are not uniquely linked to biological outcome, complicating comparisons between modalities. We introduce the Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR), a model-independent and outcome-based framework that quantifies therapeutic window changes using directly measurable delivery quantities rather than spatial dose metrics. BPNR is defined as the ratio of total particle numbers (proportional to monitor units, MU) required to reach specified levels of tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). The relative BPNR (RBPNR) compares therapeutic windows across modalities and avoids ambiguities of spatial dose averaging by relying solely on biological endpoints. As an illustration, we apply the framework to preclinical proton minibeam radiotherapy (pMBRT) versus conventional proton therapy. The absence of normal tissue complications at the highest tested MU in the pMBRT arm yields an RBPNR > 1.4, indicating a widened therapeutic window. The BPNR/RBPNR methodology provides a concise, experimentally grounded, and modality-agnostic way to quantify therapeutic window changes, with potential applications across SFRT, FLASH, high-LET radiation, and combination therapies.</p>
