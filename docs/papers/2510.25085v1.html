                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper extends the classical SIR model to include complexities like a cure and inter-city migration, using a system of differential equations to simulate disease transmission across networked populations. It presents theoretical findings on population convergence in migration frameworks (without deaths) and numerical results on how cure timing affects mortality rates and how localized interventions impact disease spread across cities. The work offers a more expressive tool for epidemiological research and public health planning by modeling epidemics at a local scope.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and public health as it offers a more sophisticated and geographically aware model for disease prediction and intervention strategy. It helps inform decisions on when and where to deploy medical resources like cures, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality during outbreaks.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves extending the classical SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model. This extension incorporates a 'cure' component, allowing individuals to recover and potentially gain immunity or reduce infectiousness, and models inter-city 'migration,' treating cities as nodes in a network with population flow. The dynamics of disease transmission and population movement are governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Theoretical analyses address specific aspects like population convergence under certain conditions (e.g., absence of deaths), while numerical simulations are employed to explore parameter sensitivities, such as the timing of cure introduction and the effects of localized interventions.</p>

                <p>This model provides a practical framework for public health officials to optimize intervention strategies, such as the timing of cure distribution or targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions. Clinically, it helps predict the spread of infectious diseases across regions, allowing for proactive resource allocation (e.g., hospital beds, medical supplies) and informing the development of adaptive response plans to mitigate outbreaks and minimize patient morbidity and mortality.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding the dynamics of the spread of diseases within populations is
critical for effective public health interventions. We extend the classical SIR
model by incorporating additional complexities such as the introduction of a
cure and migration between cities. Our framework leverages a system of
differential equations to simulate disease transmission across a network of
interconnected cities, capturing more realistic patterns. We present
theoretical results on the convergence of population sizes in the migration
framework (in the absence of deaths). We also run numerical simulations to
understand how the timing of the introduction of the cure affects mortality
rates. Our numerical results explain how localized interventions affect the
spread of the disease across cities. In summary, this work advances the
modeling of epidemics to a more local scope, offering a more expressive tool
for epidemiological research and public health planning.</p>
