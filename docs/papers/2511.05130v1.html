It posits that an antibody-mediated negative feedback loop limits long-lasting immunity, and its computational simulations reveal that individual immune variability drives a broad distribution of protection times, while also suggesting an optimal 5-week interval for a second vaccine dose.</p>

This model incorporates specific biological processes such as antigen presentation, germinal center reactions, B-cell differentiation into memory B-cells and plasma cells, and an antibody-mediated negative feedback mechanism.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The model identifies an antibody-driven negative feedback loop as a primary mechanism limiting long-lasting immunity and causing fast waning. Simulations show that inter-individual variability in immune parameters leads to a broad, log-normal-like distribution of vaccine-induced protection times, centered around 100 days. Furthermore, protection times are diminished by viral variants possessing mutated antibody binding sites or higher replication rates. Crucially, the model suggests an optimal interval of approximately 5 weeks between the first and second vaccine doses.</p>

                <p>This research offers a mechanistic explanation for the observed rapid waning of immunity following RNA vaccination, which can guide the development of next-generation vaccines. It provides evidence-based guidance for vaccine scheduling, specifically suggesting an optimal 5-week interval for a second dose, which is congruent with clinical trial data. The findings emphasize the importance of considering individual immune heterogeneity and viral evolution when formulating vaccination strategies and public health policies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">RNA-based vaccination has been broadly applied in the COVID pandemic. A
characteristic of the immunization was fast waning immunity. However, the time
scale of this process varied considerable for virus subtypes and among
individuals. Understanding the origin of this variability is crucial in order
to improve future vaccination strategies. Here, we introduce a mathematical
model of RNA-based vaccination and the kinetics of the induced immune response.
In the model, antigens produced following vaccination rise an immune response
leading to germinal center reactions and accordingly B-cell differentiation
into memory B-cells and plasma cells. In a negative feedback loop, the
antibodies synthesized by newly specified plasma cells shut down the germinal
center reaction as well as antigen-induced differentiation of memory B-cell
into plasma cells. This limits the build-up of long-lasting immunity and thus
is accompanied by fast waning immunity. The detailed data available on
infection with and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 enabled computational
simulation of essential processes of the immune response. By simulation, we
analyzed to which extent a single or double dose vaccination provides
protection against infection. We find that variability of the immune response
in individuals, originating e.g. in different immune cell densities, results in
a broad log-normal-like distribution of the vaccine-induced protection times
that peaks around 100 days. Protection times decrease for virus variants with
mutated antibody binding sites or increased replication rates. Independent of
these virus specifics, our simulations suggest optimal timing of a second dose
about 5 weeks after the first in agreement with clinical trials.</p>
