                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Thucy employs an LLM-based multi-agent system that autonomously discovers, inspects, and reasons over multiple relational databases to verify claims. It generates specific SQL queries to extract pertinent data, uses these queries to validate claims, and then outputs the verdict along with the exact SQL queries as transparent evidence. The system's performance was evaluated using the TabFact dataset.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Thucy achieves a significant improvement in claim verification accuracy on structured data, reaching 94.3% on the TabFact dataset. This represents a 5.6 percentage point increase over the previous state-of-the-art (88.7%). Its ability to operate across multiple relational databases and provide SQL-based evidence is a novel and crucial advancement.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to automatically verify complex claims against diverse, structured medical and health databases can profoundly impact clinical practice and healthcare policy. It can help validate efficacy claims for treatments, verify public health statistics, scrutinize policy impacts against official records, and reduce the spread of medical misinformation. For researchers, it offers a tool to cross-verify data integrity and findings against existing institutional or public databases, improving the rigor and reproducibility of studies. This could lead to more robust, evidence-based guidelines and decisions in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of Thucy itself. However, challenges inherent in LLM-based systems for such complex tasks often include potential for 'hallucinations' or misinterpretations, computational resource requirements for large-scale deployments, the complexity of managing and securing access to sensitive real-world medical databases, and the difficulty of ensuring complete accuracy and bias mitigation when autonomously discovering and reasoning over highly heterogeneous data sources.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated for Thucy, the paper highlights the general gap between technical possibilities and current demonstrations in claim verification. Thucy's advancements suggest future work could focus on expanding its capabilities to even more diverse, unstructured, or semi-structured data sources, improving its robustness against ambiguous or highly nuanced claims, and exploring its application in highly sensitive domains with stringent privacy and security requirements, such as personalized medicine and clinical trials.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In today's age, it is becoming increasingly difficult to decipher truth from lies. Every day, politicians, media outlets, and public figures make conflicting claims$\unicode{x2014}$often about topics that can, in principle, be verified against structured data. For instance, statements about crime rates, economic growth or healthcare can all be verified against official public records and structured datasets. Building a system that can automatically do that would have sounded like science fiction just a few years ago. Yet, with the extraordinary progress in LLMs and agentic AI, this is now within reach. Still, there remains a striking gap between what is technically possible and what is being demonstrated by recent work. Most existing verification systems operate only on small, single-table databases$\unicode{x2014}$typically a few hundred rows$\unicode{x2014}$that conveniently fit within an LLM's context window.
  In this paper we report our progress on Thucy, the first cross-database, cross-table multi-agent claim verification system that also provides concrete evidence for each verification verdict. Thucy remains completely agnostic to the underlying data sources before deployment and must therefore autonomously discover, inspect, and reason over all available relational databases to verify claims. Importantly, Thucy also reports the exact SQL queries that support its verdict (whether the claim is accurate or not) offering full transparency to expert users familiar with SQL. When evaluated on the TabFact dataset$\unicode{x2014}$the standard benchmark for fact verification over structured data$\unicode{x2014}$Thucy surpasses the previous state of the art by 5.6 percentage points in accuracy (94.3% vs. 88.7%).</p>
