                    <p>E(3)-Pose is a novel deep learning-based pose estimation method that integrates rotation equivariance and object symmetry directly into its architecture. It's designed to process rapidly acquired 3D MRI volumes to infer 6-DoF fetal head pose, which then guides the adaptive prescription of subsequent 2D diagnostic MRI slices. The method is constructed to be robust against common challenges in clinical MRI, including low resolution, noise, and anatomical ambiguities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present E(3)-Pose, a novel fast pose estimation method that jointly and explicitly models rotation equivariance and object symmetry. Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, paving the way for clinical translation. Our implementation is available at github.com/ramyamut/E3-Pose.</p>
