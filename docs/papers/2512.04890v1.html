                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>E(3)-Pose is a novel pose estimation method that explicitly incorporates two key principles: rotation equivariance and object symmetry. By modeling these characteristics 'by construction,' the method inherently accounts for pose ambiguities and anatomical symmetries, which are common issues in fetal MRI. It uses rapidly acquired 3D MRI volumes to estimate 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) fetal head pose, thus providing robust and accurate positional data.</p>

                <p>The ability of E(3)-Pose to accurately and robustly estimate fetal head pose enables the automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices. This will directly mitigate image degradation due to fetal motion, leading to higher quality diagnostic images, more confident diagnoses, and potentially shorter scan times or reduced need for repeat scans in fetal MRI examinations. This innovation directly facilitates clinical translation of advanced motion compensation strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present E(3)-Pose, a novel fast pose estimation method that jointly and explicitly models rotation equivariance and object symmetry. Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, paving the way for clinical translation. Our implementation is available at github.com/ramyamut/E3-Pose.</p>
