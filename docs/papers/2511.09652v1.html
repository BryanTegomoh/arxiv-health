                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces UCB-QRL, an optimistic Reinforcement Learning algorithm designed to optimize the $\tau$-quantile of cumulative reward in finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Addressing the classical RL's lack of risk sensitivity, UCB-QRL iteratively estimates transition probabilities and optimizes the quantile value function within a confidence ball. The algorithm provides a high-probability regret bound, making it suitable for risk-averse applications like healthcare and finance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In healthcare, patient outcomes can vary significantly, and the consequences of poor decisions can be severe. This research is critical because it enables RL agents to make decisions not just based on average expected outcomes, but with an explicit focus on managing risk, minimizing adverse events, or ensuring a high probability of successful treatment, which is essential for patient safety and trust.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a foundational algorithmic framework for developing risk-sensitive AI agents in healthcare. For instance, an AI system recommending treatment protocols could utilize this approach to prioritize patient safety and minimize adverse outcomes by optimizing for a specific quantile (e.g., the 10th percentile) of patient health rather than just the average. This ensures that even in a worst-case scenario (within a defined probability), patient outcomes are above a certain threshold, which is crucial for high-stakes medical decisions. It enables the design of AI that explicitly accounts for and manages risk in applications like drug titration, surgical planning, or resource allocation in emergency care.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>UCB-QRL is an iterative, model-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm. In each iteration, it first estimates the underlying transition probability function of the finite-horizon MDP based on observed data. Subsequently, it constructs a confidence ball around this estimated transition probability. The algorithm then optimistically optimizes the $\tau$-quantile value function within this confidence ball, effectively balancing exploration (through the confidence ball) and exploitation (optimizing the quantile objective). This 'optimism in the face of uncertainty' approach helps ensure robust performance.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the derivation of a high-probability regret bound for UCB-QRL in the episodic setting. The bound is $\mathcal O\left((2/\kappa)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/\delta)}\right)$, indicating that the algorithm's performance, in terms of cumulative reward loss compared to an optimal policy, scales polynomially with the number of states ($S$), actions ($A$), episodes ($T$), and horizon length ($H$). The crucial factor $(2/\kappa)^{H+1}$ highlights the exponential dependence on the horizon and inverse dependence on $\kappa$, a problem-dependent constant representing the sensitivity of the MDP's quantile value. A smaller $\kappa$ (higher sensitivity) leads to a larger regret, indicating a more challenging problem.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research could significantly enhance the reliability and safety of AI-driven clinical decision support systems. By optimizing for quantiles, clinicians could deploy RL agents that prioritize minimizing the risk of adverse events (e.g., optimizing for the 5th percentile of outcomes to ensure minimal negative impact) or ensuring a high probability of treatment success (e.g., optimizing for the 95th percentile of positive outcomes). This move beyond average-case optimization allows for more patient-centric and risk-aware personalized treatment strategies, potentially reducing medical errors and improving overall patient care in scenarios with high stakes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of UCB-QRL. However, common considerations for such theoretical algorithms in practical medical settings include: the practical estimation or determination of the problem-dependent constant $\kappa$; the computational complexity of optimizing over confidence balls, especially in very large state/action spaces or for long horizons; and the potential challenge of translating theoretical regret bounds into real-world clinical performance guarantees. The finite-horizon and episodic assumptions might also limit applicability to continuous or life-long treatment scenarios without adaptation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.</p>
