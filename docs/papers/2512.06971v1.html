                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the problem of prediction with expert advice under local differential privacy (LDP), proposing two novel algorithms, RW-AdaBatch and RW-Meta, that significantly improve upon classical methods. RW-AdaBatch introduces a novel privacy amplification mechanism, while RW-Meta provides a general method for privately selecting complex, non-trivial learning experts, a significant advancement over prior work. Evaluated on real-world COVID-19 hospital data, RW-Meta demonstrated superior performance, outperforming both classical LDP and state-of-the-art central DP algorithms in predicting high COVID patient density.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involves theoretical analysis and algorithm design. It first assesses a classical prediction algorithm's inherent LDP properties.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact lies in providing more robust and private predictive tools for healthcare systems. This can lead to improved resource allocation (e.g., ICU beds, staff, PPE) during public health emergencies like pandemics by accurately forecasting hotspots while fully protecting sensitive hospital reporting data. It facilitates the use of advanced machine learning for critical decision-making in healthcare without the privacy risks typically associated with sharing granular data.</p>

While the abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the proposed methods, generalizability beyond the COVID-19 prediction task or the computational overhead of these advanced LDP algorithms in extremely high-throughput clinical settings could be implicit considerations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We study the classic problem of prediction with expert advice under the constraint of local differential privacy (LDP). In this context, we first show that a classical algorithm naturally satisfies LDP and then design two new algorithms that improve it: RW-AdaBatch and RW-Meta. For RW-AdaBatch, we exploit the limited-switching behavior induced by LDP to provide a novel form of privacy amplification that grows stronger on easier data, analogous to the shuffle model in offline learning. Drawing on the theory of random walks, we prove that this improvement carries essentially no utility cost. For RW-Meta, we develop a general method for privately selecting between experts that are themselves non-trivial learning algorithms, and we show that in the context of LDP this carries no extra privacy cost. In contrast, prior work has only considered data-independent experts. We also derive formal regret bounds that scale inversely with the degree of independence between experts. Our analysis is supplemented by evaluation on real-world data reported by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic; RW-Meta outperforms both the classical baseline and a state-of-the-art \textit{central} DP algorithm by 1.5-3$\times$ on the task of predicting which hospital will report the highest density of COVID patients each week.</p>
