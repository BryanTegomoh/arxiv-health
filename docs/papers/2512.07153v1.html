                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The sensing data (e.g., from infrared sensors, cameras, radar, acoustic detectors) collected through bat monitoring can be a crucial input for AI/ML applications in health. AI could be used to analyze these large datasets to: 1) predict the spread of zoonotic diseases by modeling bat migration patterns and population dynamics, 2) identify anomalous bat behaviors indicative of infection, 3) automate the detection and tracking of bats for enhanced surveillance, and 4) develop early warning systems for potential disease spillover events.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Effective monitoring of mobile animal populations is crucial for ecological research, wildlife management, and agricultural applications. Monitoring of bats specifically can help understand the spread of disease as well as shine light on bat migration patterns, population dynamics, and the impacts of environmental changes on bat colonies. Fixed sensing modalities, such as infrared sensors, cameras, radar, and acoustic detectors, play a pivotal role in tracking and understanding animal behavior. This survey goes over context-informing details about bat biology, and then reviews these fixed sensing modalities, discussing the unique challenges and contributions of each approach. We highlight the coverage, applications, accuracy, and limitations associated with each of these sensing modalities. By synthesizing recent advances, we provide a comprehensive overview to guide future research in this area.</p>
