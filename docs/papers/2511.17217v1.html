                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Dual-domain Adaptation Networks (DAN), a novel approach for realistic image super-resolution that efficiently adapts pre-trained models from synthetic to real-world datasets. DAN employs both spatial-domain parameter adaptation, including low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a unique frequency-domain branch to recover high-frequency details. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of DAN over existing state-of-the-art models on public realistic SR benchmarks, offering significant implications for applications like medical imaging.</p>

                <p>The ability to produce high-resolution medical images from lower-resolution inputs could have transformative clinical impact. It could lead to reduced scanning times (e.g., faster MRI), lower radiation exposure (e.g., lower-dose CT/X-ray), and enhanced detail in real-time imaging (e.g., ultrasound). This could enable earlier and more accurate disease detection, better quantification of pathologies, improved surgical planning, and potentially facilitate novel diagnostic pathways by making high-quality imaging more accessible and safer.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.
