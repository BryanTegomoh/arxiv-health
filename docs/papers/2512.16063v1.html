                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces CoTI, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate qualitative thematic analysis, addressing its traditional labor-intensive and subjective nature. Applied to heart failure patient interviews, CoTI generated key phrases, themes, and a codebook that closely aligned with a senior investigator's analysis, outperforming both junior investigators and baseline NLP models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a scalable and more objective approach to understanding patient experiences in chronic diseases like heart failure, which is crucial for developing targeted, patient-centered interventions and improving communication in healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI framework (CoTI) automates qualitative thematic analysis of patient interviews, transforming a labor-intensive and subjective process into a more scalable and consistent one. This enables researchers and clinicians to more efficiently and reliably extract insights from patient narratives regarding their experiences with diseases and treatments, exemplified by analyzing heart failure patients' perceptions of medication intensity. It serves as an AI assistant for qualitative data analysis in healthcare.</p>

                    <p>The study involved developing CoTI, a multi-agent LLM framework with an Instructor, Thematizer, and CodebookGenerator. This framework was then applied to a dataset of 12 heart failure patient interviews to perform qualitative thematic analysis on medication intensity perceptions.

Additionally, a user-facing application was created to explore AI-human interaction in this analytical context.</p>

                    <p>CoTI successfully produced qualitative analyses (key phrases, themes, and codebook) that showed greater alignment with a senior investigator's work than those from junior investigators or standard NLP models. However, direct collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators offered only marginal improvements, suggesting potential issues with human overreliance on the AI system and a subsequent limitation in independent critical thinking.</p>

                <p>The study indicated that direct collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting potential overreliance on the AI system that may limit independent critical thinking. The application was demonstrated on a relatively small sample size (12 patient interviews).</p>

                <p>Further research is needed to optimize AI-human collaboration models in qualitative analysis, specifically addressing mechanisms to mitigate overreliance and foster critical thinking among human users. Additionally, validating CoTI on larger and more diverse patient interview datasets across various medical conditions would be beneficial to assess its generalizability and robustness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.</p>
