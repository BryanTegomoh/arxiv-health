                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DentalX is built upon a deep learning framework, likely an advanced object detection model. Its core innovation lies in a 'structural context extraction module' that learns to semantically segment dental anatomy (e.g., individual teeth, bone, soft tissue boundaries) as an auxiliary task. The rich, context-aware features derived from this segmentation task are then integrated into the feature pipeline of the primary disease detection task, enabling the model to utilize comprehensive oral structural information to better interpret subtle disease patterns in radiographs.</p>

The research highlights that the model effectively captures the correlation between these two tasks, leading to a synergistic performance improvement for both.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Diagnosing dental diseases from radiographs is time-consuming and challenging due to the subtle nature of diagnostic evidence. Existing methods, which rely on object detection models designed for natural images with more distinct target patterns, struggle to detect dental diseases that present with far less visual support. To address this challenge, we propose {\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks. This mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization, as the correlation between the two tasks is effectively captured. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/DentYOLOX.</p>
