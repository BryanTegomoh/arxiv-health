                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel patient-specific reinforced learning approach to generate 3D activity maps for dosimetry from just two 2D planar scintigraphy images (anterior and posterior). By developing patient-specific datasets and utilizing AI models like 3DUnet and diffusion models, the method aims to replace expensive and time-consuming 3D SPECT acquisitions with fast planar imaging. The study demonstrates enhanced accuracy and organ delineation, offering a paradigm shift for nuclear medicine dosimetry.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using patient-specific deep learning models (3DUnet, diffusion models, reinforcement learning) to reconstruct or generate high-fidelity 3D radiation dose distribution maps (activity maps) from limited 2D planar scintigraphy images. This allows for accurate 3D dosimetry quantification without the need for time-consuming and expensive 3D SPECT scans, thereby improving therapy planning, monitoring, and overall patient management in nuclear medicine treatments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to
generate 3D activity maps from two 2D planar images (anterior and posterior).
The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional
methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine
where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as
177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT
acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate
3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry
applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point
dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific
dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the
anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use
of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D
planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar
acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement
learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ
delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with
patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for
simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an
hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of
paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using
only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT
leveraging the pre-therapy information of the patients.</p>
