                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ShapeX, a novel framework designed to provide explainable AI for time series classification models by focusing on shapelets. ShapeX segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and utilizes Shapley values to assess their saliency, thereby addressing the crucial need for transparency in high-stakes applications like healthcare. The framework demonstrates superior precision and causal fidelity in identifying relevant subsequences compared to existing explanation methods, grounding explanations in causal relationships rather than mere correlations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research directly contributes to medical AI by enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of time series classification models used in healthcare. It allows clinicians and researchers to understand *why* an AI model made a particular prediction based on physiological or clinical time-series data, by identifying key underlying 'shapelets' (meaningful subsequences). This improved transparency and causal insight can lead to more reliable diagnoses, better informed treatment decisions, and increased confidence in AI-driven health recommendations.</p>

                    <p>ShapeX demonstrably outperforms existing post-hoc time series explanation methods. It achieves superior precision in identifying the most relevant subsequences within time series data.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research could significantly enhance the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI models in healthcare. By providing clear, causal explanations based on specific physiological patterns (shapelets), clinicians can gain a deeper understanding of model predictions (e.g., disease diagnosis, risk stratification). This interpretability facilitates more confident clinical decision-making, supports regulatory approval for medical AI devices, and could lead to earlier and more precise interventions by highlighting the exact contributing factors from complex patient time-series data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p>
