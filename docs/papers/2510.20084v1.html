                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">ShapeX is an innovative framework addressing the limitations of existing post-hoc time series explanation methods by focusing on shapelet-driven segments rather than individual timesteps. It leverages the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework and Shapley values to identify salient subsequences, providing explanations that reveal causal relationships instead of mere correlations. Experimental results confirm ShapeX's superior performance in precision and causal fidelity compared to current approaches.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>ShapeX can be applied to enhance the explainability of AI models that classify time-series medical data (e.g., ECGs for arrhythmia detection, EEGs for seizure prediction, continuous glucose monitoring for diabetes management, vital signs for predicting adverse events). By identifying specific 'shapelets' (key subsequences) in a patient's data and attributing causality, it can help clinicians understand the rationale behind an AI's diagnosis, prognosis, or intervention recommendation, thereby increasing trust and facilitating more informed clinical decisions.</p>

                <p>ShapeX has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by providing more interpretable and trustworthy AI models for medical time series data. Clinicians could gain deeper insights into *why* a model made a specific prediction (e.g., detecting early signs of sepsis from vital signs or diagnosing an arrhythmia from an ECG), enabling more confident clinical decision-making, improved patient safety, and potentially uncovering novel disease biomarkers. This enhanced transparency is crucial for the regulatory approval and widespread adoption of AI in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p>
