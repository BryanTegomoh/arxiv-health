                <p class="summary-text">This study presents a transversely isotropic poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC), based on Reissner-Mindlin plate theory, to explore the mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure (IOP) variations and glaucoma. The model demonstrates that increasing IOP leads to peak strains and stresses in the peripheral LC, a known site of glaucomatous damage, and predicts a reduction in fluid content that could contribute to ischemia.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">To explore the possible mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure
(IOP) variations and glaucoma, this study presents a transversely isotropic
poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) based on Reissner Mindlin plate
theory, ultimately highlighting the interplay between solid matrix deformation
and blood flow behavior under pathological conditions. Starting from
poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were
formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and
hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress
measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the
peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial
site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a
pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons.
In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP
rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The
influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic
assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear
strain. Given the current experimental challenges in measuring blood flow
within the LC, the proposed model provides a valuable framework for exploring
the coupled mechanical hemodynamic behavior of the tissue and for inverse
estimation of its mechanical parameters, such as the stiffness of the opening
for the central retinal vessels.</p>
