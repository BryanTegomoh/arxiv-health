                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel statistical framework, utilizing chi-square and PERMANOVA tests, to robustly compare different "epidemic forests"—collections of plausible transmission trees—derived from outbreak data. The framework addresses the critical gap of lacking formal methods to assess statistically significant differences between these forests, demonstrating PERMANOVA's superior sensitivity in distinguishing forests generated under varying transmission dynamics. It provides the first robust tool for quantitatively comparing epidemic forests.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is crucial for rigorously evaluating and comparing different models and assumptions used to reconstruct disease transmission pathways, thereby informing more effective public health interventions, validating epidemiological insights, and assessing the impact of various outbreak control strategies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Not applicable, as this paper proposes a statistical framework and methods (chi-square test, PERMANOVA) rather than an AI application. While the findings and methods could inform or be integrated into AI-driven public health surveillance, outbreak prediction, or decision support systems, the paper itself does not describe an AI application.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed a statistical framework incorporating two distinct methods: a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). These methods were assessed for their performance in distinguishing between simulated epidemic forests. The simulations involved generating forests under different underlying offspring distributions, which represent varying patterns of disease transmission. Performance was evaluated based on specificity (correctly identifying non-different forests) and sensitivity (correctly identifying statistically different forests) across various epidemic and forest sizes.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study successfully established a robust statistical framework for comparing epidemic forests. Both the chi-square test and PERMANOVA demonstrated perfect specificity for larger forests (with 100 or more trees), indicating their reliability in not falsely identifying differences. Crucially, PERMANOVA consistently and significantly outperformed the chi-square test in terms of sensitivity, proving more effective at accurately detecting statistically significant differences between forests generated under distinct transmission dynamics, regardless of the size of the epidemic or the number of trees in the forest.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework provides epidemiologists and public health officials with an essential tool to objectively compare the outputs of different transmission tree inference methods or the impacts of varying assumptions on outbreak reconstruction. This enhanced rigor in analyzing 'who infected whom' will improve the validation of epidemiological models, leading to a more precise understanding of disease spread. Ultimately, this can inform more evidence-based public health interventions, better targeting of control measures, and a more accurate evaluation of intervention effectiveness during outbreaks.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the proposed framework. However, the evaluation primarily focused on distinguishing forests generated under "different offspring distributions." This suggests that the framework's performance might need further validation against other types of epidemiological variations (e.g., spatial transmission patterns, contact network structures, or pathogen genomic diversity) not directly related to offspring distributions. The abstract also does not discuss potential computational limitations or scalability issues when dealing with extremely large or complex epidemic forests.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly mentioned, potential future research directions could involve: extending the framework to incorporate and compare other epidemiological features beyond offspring distributions (e.g., spatiotemporal characteristics or host demographics); investigating its performance with real-world, potentially incomplete or noisy, surveillance data; and exploring its integration into more advanced software platforms for comprehensive outbreak analysis and real-time decision support.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.</p>
