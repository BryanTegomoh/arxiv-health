                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the first statistical framework for robustly comparing epidemic forests, which are collections of plausible transmission trees. The framework utilizes both a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to assess the statistical significance of differences between these forests. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for larger forests (100+ trees), PERMANOVA consistently demonstrated superior sensitivity across all tested epidemic and forest sizes, making it a more reliable tool for distinguishing transmission dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurately inferring transmission pathways is fundamental for understanding disease spread and designing effective public health interventions. This framework provides a robust method to compare different models or assumptions about 'who infected whom,' ensuring that epidemiological conclusions drawn from epidemic forests are statistically sound and reliable for guiding medical and public health decisions.</p>

While the insights from comparing epidemic forests could potentially inform AI models for outbreak prediction or intervention strategies, the framework itself is statistical (chi-square test, PERMANOVA) rather than AI-based.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes a statistical framework leveraging two distinct statistical tests: a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). These methods were evaluated on their ability to differentiate between simulated epidemic forests. These forests were generated under various 'offspring distributions' to model different transmission patterns, and tested across a range of epidemic and forest sizes. Performance was assessed by measuring the sensitivity (ability to detect true differences) and specificity (ability to correctly identify no difference) of each method.</p>

Critically, PERMANOVA consistently demonstrated superior sensitivity compared to the chi-square test across all analyzed epidemic and forest sizes, making it the more robust method for distinguishing statistically significant differences between epidemic forests.</p>

                <p>This framework offers a crucial tool for validating and refining epidemiological models of disease transmission. Clinically, it allows public health agencies and researchers to statistically compare insights derived from different outbreak reconstruction methods. This ensures that interventions, such as contact tracing, isolation strategies, or resource allocation, are based on robust, statistically verified understandings of transmission dynamics, leading to more effective and targeted public health responses during outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.</p>
