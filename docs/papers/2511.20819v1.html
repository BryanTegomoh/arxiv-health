                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the first statistical framework for formally comparing different sets of plausible transmission trees, known as 'epidemic forests', a critical missing tool in outbreak analysis. Using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), the authors demonstrate that PERMANOVA consistently outperforms the chi-square test in sensitivity across various epidemic and forest sizes, providing a robust method implemented in the `mixtree` R package.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework provides a much-needed robust statistical tool for validating and comparing the outputs of different transmission inference models, which is essential for accurately characterizing infectious disease outbreaks and informing effective public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper presents a statistical framework implemented in an R package, rather than an AI application in the strict sense of machine learning or deep learning. The methods used (chi-square test, PERMANOVA) are classical statistical tools. While it provides computational tools for public health, it does not fall under 'medical AI' applications.</p>

                    <p>The study proposes a statistical framework based on a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to compare epidemic forests.

                    <p>The study found that both the chi-square test and PERMANOVA achieved perfect specificity for epidemic forests comprising 100 or more trees. Crucially, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in terms of sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes tested, making it the more robust method for distinguishing between different epidemic forests.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework will enable epidemiologists to formally compare and validate the inferred transmission dynamics from different models or surveillance data. This improved ability to rigorously assess the quality and consistency of 'who infected whom' inferences can lead to more reliable outbreak characterizations, better understanding of disease spread, and more evidence-based decisions regarding public health interventions like contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.</p>
