                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the first statistical framework to formally compare epidemic forests, which are collections of plausible transmission trees inferred from outbreak data. Addressing the lack of a robust method to assess differences between such forests, the authors propose using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Their assessment shows PERMANOVA consistently outperforms the chi-square test in sensitivity, while both achieve perfect specificity for larger forests, providing a robust tool for epidemic analysis.</p>

                <p>This paper develops a statistical framework, not an AI application. However, the robust comparison of epidemic forests and the understanding of transmission dynamics it provides are crucial for informing and validating AI models used in outbreak prediction, contact tracing optimization, resource allocation during epidemics, and the development of intelligent public health intervention strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved proposing two statistical tests, a chi-square test and Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), to compare epidemic forests. These methods were evaluated by simulating epidemic forests under different offspring distributions. Performance was measured by assessing their specificity (true negative rate) and sensitivity (true positive rate) across various epidemic and forest sizes to distinguish between these simulated forests.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings indicate that both the chi-square test and PERMANOVA achieved perfect specificity when comparing epidemic forests containing 100 or more trees. Crucially, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all tested epidemic and forest sizes, demonstrating its superior ability to correctly identify differences between forests. This establishes PERMANOVA as a more robust method for distinguishing statistically significant differences in epidemic forests.</p>

This framework provides a rigorous method to compare and validate the outputs of different transmission inference models, leading to a more accurate understanding of 'who infected whom' during an outbreak. This improved understanding can directly inform the design and deployment of more effective public health interventions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance the characterization of transmission dynamics for better outbreak control and prevention strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.</p>
