                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study, a preregistered randomized controlled experiment (N=2,004), investigated how AI-generated summaries in online search results influence users' attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support across debated topics. It found that these summaries consistently shift user perceptions to align with the summary's stance, with top placement causing stronger attitudinal shifts and harm-framed summaries being perceived as more useful.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and health as it demonstrates how AI-generated information in online searches can significantly influence public attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support concerning health topics. This directly impacts patient education, health literacy, and the effectiveness of public health initiatives, especially given the observed differential impact of 'harm-framed' information.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper does not describe a direct medical AI application (e.g., diagnostic AI). Instead, it analyzes the societal and public health implications of general AI applications (AI-generated search summaries) on how users consume and perceive health-related information. It is crucial for understanding the impact of AI on public understanding of health topics, patient education, and the responsible design of AI systems that interact with health information.</p>

                    <p>A preregistered randomized controlled experiment was conducted with 2,004 participants. Participants viewed mock online search result pages where the presence (vs. absence), placement (top vs. middle), and framing stance (benefit-framed vs. harm-framed) of AI-generated summaries were systematically varied across four publicly debated topics. Outcome measures included self-reported issue attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This study has several potential clinical and practical impacts:
*   **Patient Engagement & Adherence**: AI summaries can shape patient perceptions of treatments, health risks, and preventive measures, potentially influencing adherence to medical advice or participation in health programs.
*   **Informed Consent & Shared Decision-Making**: Healthcare providers need to recognize that patients may arrive with pre-formed biases or specific framings of health issues derived from AI summaries, necessitating more deliberate communication to ensure truly informed consent.
*   **Public Health Strategies**: Public health campaigns disseminating information on vaccines, disease prevention, or lifestyle changes must strategically counter or leverage AI summary dynamics to ensure factual and balanced information uptake.
*   **Digital Health Tool Design**: Developers of health-related AI tools and information platforms must prioritize ethical summary generation and presentation to avoid unintended persuasive effects that could misguide users on critical health choices.
*   **Misinformation Management**: Understanding how AI summaries exert influence, particularly regarding perceived harms, can inform strategies to combat health misinformation spread through search engines and AI-integrated systems.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly detail specific limitations of the study. Potential implicit limitations might include the reliance on self-reported measures, the use of mock search pages rather than real-world environments, and the generalizability of findings across all demographics or health literacy levels.</p>

                <p>The study raises important implications for the design and regulation of AI-integrated information ecosystems. Future research could explore optimal summary design strategies to mitigate unwanted persuasive effects, investigate the long-term impact of AI summaries on health behaviors, and examine how regulatory frameworks can ensure responsible deployment of AI in health-related information dissemination. Further studies could also explore the effects across diverse user demographics and varying levels of health literacy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study examined how AI-generated summaries, which have become visually prominent in online search results, affect how users think about different issues. In a preregistered randomized controlled experiment, participants (N = 2,004) viewed mock search result pages varying in the presence (vs. absence), placement (top vs. middle), and stance (benefit-framed vs. harm-framed) of AI-generated summaries across four publicly debated topics. Compared to a no-summary control group, participants exposed to AI-generated summaries reported issue attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support that aligned more closely with the AI summary stance. The summaries placed at the top of the page produced stronger shifts in users' issue attitudes (but not behavioral intentions or policy support) than those placed at the middle of the page. We also observed moderating effects from issue familiarity and general trust toward AI. In addition, users perceived the AI summaries more useful when it emphasized health harms versus benefits. These findings suggest that AI-generated search summaries can significantly shape public perceptions, raising important implications for the design and regulation of AI-integrated information ecosystems.</p>
