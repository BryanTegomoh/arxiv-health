                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework designed to generate universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations by integrating H&E and multiple immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain features. Addressing the challenge of data scarcity and inter-stain misalignment, CSCL leverages a newly curated five-stain dataset to achieve robust cross-stain representation learning through patch-wise and slide-level alignment. The framework demonstrates consistent performance gains across cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.</p>

                    <p>The study proposes Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework.

This stage incorporates a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. This framework is built upon a newly curated, slide-level aligned dataset containing H&E and four key IHC stains (HER2, KI67, ER, PGR).</p>

                <p>This technology has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in clinical pathology. By enabling more robust and transferable AI models, it could lead to earlier and more precise cancer diagnoses, better patient stratification for targeted therapies through enhanced biomarker detection, and more accurate survival predictions. The ability to generate high-quality H&E representations, even when trained with multi-stain data, suggests practical utility in settings where only H&E slides are routinely available, thus facilitating the integration of advanced AI into standard clinical workflows.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.
