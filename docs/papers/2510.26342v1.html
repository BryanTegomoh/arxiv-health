                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces "interventional constraints," a novel concept in causal discovery that integrates high-level causal knowledge as inequality constraints on total causal effects between variables. Unlike existing methods that enforce structural paths, this approach ensures learned linear causal models accurately reflect known directions and magnitudes of influence, preventing incorrect conclusions (e.g., PIP3 activating Akt vs. inhibiting Akt). This integration demonstrably improves model accuracy, enhances explainability, and facilitates the discovery of new, otherwise costly, causal relationships in real-world biological networks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.</p>
