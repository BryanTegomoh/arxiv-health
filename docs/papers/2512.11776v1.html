                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC) is a novel hybrid neural network architecture addressing spectral bias and dimensionality issues in coordinate-based networks for representing continuous physical fields. It integrates deep learning for diffeomorphic domain warping with classical approximation theory using generalized analytic functions, notably employing a differentiable linear solver for optimal, closed-form spectral coefficient resolution. AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly reduces parameter counts (orders of magnitude), and accelerates convergence (2-3x) on rigorous physics benchmarks, including sparse medical reconstruction.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC) employs a hybrid deep learning approach. A deep neural network first learns a 'diffeomorphic warping' to map the complex physical domain onto a simpler latent manifold.

Crucially, the standard gradient-descent-based output layer is replaced by a 'differentiable linear solver', which calculates the optimal spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass, rather than through iterative optimization.</p>

It dramatically reduces the parameter footprint, showing orders of magnitude fewer parameters (e.g., 840 parameters for 3D fields compared to 4.2 million for traditional methods or INRs).

                <p>The ability of AVC to perform highly accurate 'sparse medical reconstruction' with significantly fewer parameters and faster convergence has profound clinical implications. It could enable the development of faster, lower-dose medical imaging techniques (e.g., CT, MRI), improve the reconstruction quality from incomplete or noisy sensor data, and facilitate the deployment of advanced imaging analytics on resource-constrained hardware. This translates to safer patient care, quicker diagnoses, and more efficient healthcare delivery.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Coordinate-based neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for representing continuous physical fields, yet they face two fundamental pathologies: spectral bias, which hinders the learning of high-frequency dynamics, and the curse of dimensionality, which causes parameter explosion in discrete feature grids. We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations. This work establishes a new paradigm for memory-efficient, spectrally accurate scientific machine learning. The code is available at https://github.com/VladimerKhasia/vecua.</p>
