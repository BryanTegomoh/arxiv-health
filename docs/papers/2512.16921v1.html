                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">AuditDM introduces an automated framework that leverages reinforcement learning to train an MLLM as an auditor, generating challenging questions and counterfactual images designed to maximize disagreement among target models. This process effectively discovers significant, interpretable capability gaps and failure modes, which are then used as annotation-free data to rectify the models, leading to substantial performance improvements and enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AuditDM framework can be applied to audit and improve MLLMs specifically trained for medical applications. For example, it could be used to: 1) Identify and rectify failure modes in MLLMs designed for interpreting medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) in conjunction with patient history or reports, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing misinterpretations. 2) Enhance the robustness of MLLMs used in multimodal diagnostic support systems that integrate diverse data types like imaging, lab results, and clinical notes. 3) Provide insights into *why* a medical AI model makes errors, which is essential for clinician trust and responsible AI deployment in healthcare settings.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>AuditDM employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune an MLLM, transforming it into an 'auditor'. This auditor is trained to generate specific, challenging questions and synthetically modified 'counterfactual images'. The generation process is guided by an objective to maximize disagreement or divergence in responses among multiple target MLLMs. The resulting divergent exemplars, which highlight specific model weaknesses, are then collected and utilized as annotation-free data to fine-tune and rectify the identified shortcomings of the target models.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>AuditDM demonstrated its efficacy by discovering over 20 distinct failure types in state-of-the-art MLLMs (Gemma-3, PaliGemma-2). Fine-tuning based on these discovered failures consistently improved all audited models across 16 diverse benchmarks. A particularly striking finding was the ability of a 3B parameter model, after rectification with AuditDM's discoveries, to achieve performance superior to its significantly larger 28B parameter counterpart, highlighting the power of targeted auditing over sheer model scale.</p>

                <p>Applying AuditDM in the medical field could significantly enhance the trustworthiness and robustness of MLLMs used for clinical applications. By proactively identifying and correcting subtle biases, misinterpretations, or knowledge gaps, it can reduce the risk of diagnostic errors, improve the accuracy of treatment recommendations, and ensure patient safety. Furthermore, enabling smaller models to achieve high performance through targeted auditing has practical implications for deploying efficient and resource-friendly AI solutions in healthcare settings.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential implicit limitations could include the significant computational resources required for training the reinforcement learning-based auditor, the generalizability of discovered failure modes across highly diverse or domain-specific medical MLLM architectures, and the potential need for a sufficiently diverse set of 'target models' to effectively maximize disagreement.</p>

                <p>The paper suggests a future direction focused on targeted model auditing as a primary strategy for MLLM improvement, especially as data scaling reaches diminishing returns. Future research could explore optimizing the efficiency of the RL-based auditing process, adapting AuditDM to uncover specific types of medically critical errors (e.g., subtle imaging misinterpretations), and investigating the transferability of discovered failure modes to enhance robustness across various medical sub-specialties and clinical applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.</p>
