                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach combining autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction with stability-aware clustering to identify rare but reproducible genomic subtypes from RNA-seq data. Applied to Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC), the method successfully discovered a rare (6.85% of patients), highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787) subtype, C0, characterized by coherent differentially expressed gene markers.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Identifying rare, reproducible genomic subtypes is crucial for advancing precision medicine by enabling the discovery of specific patient populations that may benefit from targeted therapies or require distinct prognostic monitoring, ultimately leading to more effective and personalized cancer treatments.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using autoencoder-based representation and stability-aware clustering (unsupervised machine learning) on high-dimensional RNA-seq gene expression data to identify novel molecular subtypes of cancer. This enables the discovery of patient subgroups with distinct genomic profiles, which can inform targeted therapies, improve disease classification, and enhance prognostic models in oncology. The identified 'coherent markers' could serve as AI-derived diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved selecting the top 2,000 highly variable genes from RNA-seq data, standardizing them, and then training a feed-forward autoencoder to reduce dimensionality to a 128-dimensional latent space. K-means clustering was applied in this latent space for k values from 2 to 10. Cluster discovery was guided by a pre-specified rule: a cluster must be rare (<10% of samples) and stable (Jaccard index >= 0.60 across 20 independent runs with Hungarian alignment). Finally, cluster-vs-rest differential gene expression was performed using Welch's t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study's key findings include that pan-cancer RNA-seq clustering is largely dominated by tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), rendering it unsuitable for subtle subtype discovery. More significantly, by focusing on KIRC and employing a stability-aware clustering approach, a rare (6.85% of patients) and highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787) genomic subtype, C0, was successfully identified at k=5. This rare subtype was further confirmed to have distinct and coherent differentially expressed gene markers.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The discovery of rare, reproducible genomic subtypes, such as the KIRC C0 subtype, has significant clinical potential. It could lead to the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for early detection, the development of highly specific therapeutic targets for personalized medicine, and improved prognostic stratification for patients who might otherwise be grouped into broader, less informative categories. This can pave the way for tailored treatment regimens, minimizing ineffective therapies and adverse side effects.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily highlights that unsupervised pan-cancer RNA-seq clustering is largely dominated by tissue of origin, thereby justifying the necessity for a targeted, within-cancer approach to discover meaningful patient subtypes. It does not explicitly state limitations of the developed autoencoder-embedding and stability-aware clustering method itself, but rather frames the initial pan-cancer finding as a 'negative control' that necessitated their reframing of the problem.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.</p>
