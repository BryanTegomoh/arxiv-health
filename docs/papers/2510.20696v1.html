                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on textual priors when performing complex visual reasoning tasks. This paper addresses these issues by systematically diagnosing existing MLLMs and proposing an agent-based architecture that combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules for iterative refinement. The new system achieves significant performance gains on benchmarks, matching or surpassing much larger models, highlighting the need for integrating specialized visual tools.</p>

                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as it directly tackles the critical challenges of visual hallucination and textual bias in AI models, which are paramount for accurate interpretation of medical images. Improving visual reasoning capabilities and ensuring reliability in MLLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient safety in healthcare applications.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Improving the reliability, accuracy, and safety of multimodal AI systems used for analyzing and interpreting medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, pathology slides, retinal scans). By enhancing visual reasoning, reducing 'hallucinations,' and enabling more fine-grained analysis, this research helps lay the groundwork for AI tools that can more accurately assist clinicians in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning, thereby reducing the risk of errors stemming from AI misinterpretation of visual medical data.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.</p>
