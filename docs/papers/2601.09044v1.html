                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>POWDR utilizes a conditioned wavelet diffusion model for 3D MRI outpainting. The core methodology involves preserving a specified pathological region within an image while generating the surrounding anatomical context. This is achieved by conditioning the diffusion process in the wavelet domain to maintain high-frequency details and avoid blurring. A random connected mask strategy is employed during training to prevent mode collapse and enhance the diversity of the generated regions. The method was evaluated quantitatively using metrics like FID, SSIM, LPIPS for realism, and cosine similarity, KL divergence for diversity, alongside a clinical task of tumor segmentation using nnU-Net.</p>

                    <p>POWDR successfully generates realistic and diverse pathology-preserving 3D MRI data for both brain and knee anatomies. The random connected mask training strategy proved vital, significantly enhancing diversity (cosine similarity reduced from 0.9947 to 0.9580; KL divergence increased from 0.00026 to 0.01494). Crucially, supplementing training datasets with only 50 synthetic POWDR cases improved tumor segmentation Dice scores using nnU-Net from 0.6992 to 0.7137. Furthermore, the generated images maintained anatomical plausibility, with no significant differences observed in CSF and GM tissue volumes compared to real images.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical imaging datasets often suffer from class imbalance and limited availability of pathology-rich cases, which constrains the performance of machine learning models for segmentation, classification, and vision-language tasks. To address this challenge, we propose POWDR, a pathology-preserving outpainting framework for 3D MRI based on a conditioned wavelet diffusion model. Unlike conventional augmentation or unconditional synthesis, POWDR retains real pathological regions while generating anatomically plausible surrounding tissue, enabling diversity without fabricating lesions.
  Our approach leverages wavelet-domain conditioning to enhance high-frequency detail and mitigate blurring common in latent diffusion models. We introduce a random connected mask training strategy to overcome conditioning-induced collapse and improve diversity outside the lesion. POWDR is evaluated on brain MRI using BraTS datasets and extended to knee MRI to demonstrate tissue-agnostic applicability. Quantitative metrics (FID, SSIM, LPIPS) confirm image realism, while diversity analysis shows significant improvement with random-mask training (cosine similarity reduced from 0.9947 to 0.9580; KL divergence increased from 0.00026 to 0.01494). Clinically relevant assessments reveal gains in tumor segmentation performance using nnU-Net, with Dice scores improving from 0.6992 to 0.7137 when adding 50 synthetic cases. Tissue volume analysis indicates no significant differences for CSF and GM compared to real images.
  These findings highlight POWDR as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in medical imaging. The method is extensible to multiple anatomies and offers a controllable framework for generating diverse, pathology-preserving synthetic data to support robust model development.</p>
