                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for 'mind-drawing' that reconstructs a subject's imagined shapes by iteratively analyzing Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) from single-channel EEG. By adaptively presenting flicker-frequency encoded visual probes and leveraging symbiotic human-AI interaction, the system achieves a significant increase in BCI bit-rates, further enabling detailed visualization of reconstructed mental images using stable diffusion models.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves analyzing Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) derived from single-channel EEG data. Visual stimuli, or 'probes,' are adaptively presented on a screen, each encoded at a distinct flicker-frequency. Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically govern the spatial placement of these probes to iteratively explore the image space. The subject's internal visual intent (imagined shapes) is inferred and reconstructed by analyzing the SSVEP responses to these probes. Post-reconstruction, stable diffusion models are utilized to transform the abstract mental images into detailed and realistic visual representations.</p>

A key finding is the significant increase in BCI bit-rates, exceeding a five-fold improvement, achieved through symbiotic human-AI interaction. Furthermore, the integration of stable diffusion models enabled the transformation of these reconstructed mental images into highly detailed and realistic visual outputs.</p>

                <p>This research has substantial clinical impact by paving the way for more accessible and user-friendly assistive communication and control devices for patients with severe motor disabilities, such as those with locked-in syndrome or conditions hindering verbal communication. The low hardware requirement (single-channel EEG) reduces cost and complexity, potentially democratizing BCI access for wider clinical applications in rehabilitation, cognitive assessment, and performance enhancement, without the risks associated with invasive implants.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are evolving from research prototypes into clinical, assistive, and performance enhancement technologies. Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.</p>
