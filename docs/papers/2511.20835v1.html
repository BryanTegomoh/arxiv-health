                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for "mind-drawing" that reconstructs simple imagined shapes by inferring a subject's internal visual intent. It leverages adaptive flicker-frequency encoded visual probes and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) from single-channel EEG, dynamically guided by AI policies, to achieve rapid and high-fidelity mental image reconstruction, significantly boosting BCI bit-rates.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research advances non-invasive BCI technology, offering a more accessible and efficient method for communication, artistic expression, and environmental control for individuals with severe motor impairments. It also holds potential for enhanced performance and rehabilitation applications by reducing hardware complexity and leveraging AI.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research uses machine learning policies (Gabor-inspired or machine-learned) to dynamically update visual probes for inferring internal visual intent, and leverages stable diffusion models to transform reconstructed mental images into realistic representations. Crucially, it demonstrates that this 'symbiotic human-AI interaction' significantly increases BCI bit-rates by over 5x. This AI augmentation enhances the speed and capability of BCIs, making them more effective for clinical applications such as communication for individuals with severe motor impairments (e.g., locked-in syndrome) or control of assistive devices.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The BCI employs a non-invasive approach that iteratively infers visual intent. It adaptively presents visual probes encoded at distinct flicker-frequencies on a screen, analyzing the resulting Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) from single-channel EEG. Either Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically guide the spatial placement of these probes to explore the image space, facilitating the reconstruction of imagined shapes. Post-reconstruction, stable diffusion models are utilized to transform the mental images into more detailed and realistic visual representations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are evolving from research prototypes into clinical, assistive, and performance enhancement technologies. Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.</p>
