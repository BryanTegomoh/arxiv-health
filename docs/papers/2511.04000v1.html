                <p class="abstract">Decision trees are widely used in high-stakes fields like finance and
healthcare due to their interpretability. This work introduces an efficient,
scalable method for generating synthetic pre-training data to enable
meta-learning of decision trees. Our approach samples near-optimal decision
trees synthetically, creating large-scale, realistic datasets. Using the
MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves
performance comparable to pre-training on real-world data or with
computationally expensive optimal decision trees. This strategy significantly
reduces computational costs, enhances data generation flexibility, and paves
the way for scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree
models.</p>
