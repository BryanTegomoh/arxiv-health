                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model designed for contrast enhancement in medical images without introducing common artifacts like organ distortion or false findings. SMILE selectively enhances clinically relevant regions by learning organ shapes and contrast dynamics, demonstrating superior image quality and significant improvements in cancer detection, particularly from non-contrast CT scans.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work is highly relevant for medical imaging and diagnostics as it addresses critical limitations of current image enhancement techniques that can compromise diagnostic accuracy. By providing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful enhanced images, SMILE directly supports better clinical decision-making and potentially improves the early detection of diseases like cancer.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an 'anatomy-aware diffusion model' (SMILE) that enhances medical images (specifically CT scans, multi-phase and non-contrast) by learning organ shapes and contrast dynamics. This enhancement aims to improve the visual quality of medical images, aid clinical decision-making, prevent false findings, and significantly boost the detection accuracy of conditions like cancer from non-contrast scans.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SMILE is an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns from medical images by modeling organ shapes and their contrast uptake characteristics. Its methodology is built upon three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision, which guides the model to respect true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning, enabling direct processing of unaligned multi-phase CT scans; and (3) unified inference, which ensures fast and consistent enhancement across different contrast phases.</p>

                    <p>SMILE consistently outperforms existing methods in objective image quality metrics (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID). It successfully generates anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful enhanced images. Critically, SMILE improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT by increasing the F1 score by up to 10%, demonstrating its clinical utility in improving diagnostic accuracy without over-editing or introducing artifacts.</p>

                <p>SMILE has the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic confidence and accuracy in radiology by providing clearer, anatomically faithful images that highlight clinically relevant features. Its ability to improve cancer detection from non-contrast CT could lead to earlier diagnoses, potentially reducing the need for contrast agents in some cases and streamlining workflows by offering consistent enhancement across multi-phase studies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Image enhancement improves visual quality and helps reveal details that are hard to see in the original image. In medical imaging, it can support clinical decision-making, but current models often over-edit. This can distort organs, create false findings, and miss small tumors because these models do not understand anatomy or contrast dynamics. We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images. SMILE also improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT, raising the F1 score by up to 10 percent.</p>
