                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>UCAgents employs a hierarchical multi-agent framework, mimicking clinical workflows, to achieve unidirectional convergence via structured evidence auditing. It enforces strict interaction protocols by forbidding position changes and limiting agent discussions to targeted evidence verification. A key component is a 'one-round inquiry discussion' designed to identify visual-textual misalignments. The underlying design principle to constrain visual ambiguity and textual noise (a 'dual-noise bottleneck') is formally described using information theory. The framework's performance was rigorously evaluated on four medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks.</p>

                    <p>UCAgents achieved superior diagnostic accuracy, reaching 71.3% on PathVQA, which represents a 6.0% improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, it also demonstrated significantly higher computational efficiency with an 87.7% reduction in token cost. The evaluation confirmed its ability to effectively balance the extraction of visual evidence with the avoidance of confusing textual interference, leading to enhanced diagnostic reliability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The enhanced diagnostic accuracy, reliability, and computational efficiency of UCAgents hold substantial clinical impact. By ensuring VLM reasoning is explicitly anchored to visual evidence, it directly addresses a major barrier to AI adoption in medicine – lack of trust due to inexplicable or detached reasoning. This fosters greater clinician confidence in AI decision support systems, potentially leading to more accurate diagnoses, especially in medical image interpretation, and more efficient clinical workflows due to reduced computational overhead.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.
