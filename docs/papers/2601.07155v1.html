                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Veto, a novel objective-level reformulation for stable on-policy knowledge distillation (KD) that addresses the training instability and distributional gaps inherent in current methods. Veto constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space using an intermediate target distribution, effectively stabilizing optimization by adaptively suppressing harmful gradients and balancing output diversity with performance. Experiments show Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and other on-policy baselines across various reasoning and generation tasks.</p>

                <p>Veto can facilitate the development and deployment of specialized medical AI tools by allowing the distillation of complex medical knowledge from large models into smaller, more efficient, and secure student models. This enables faster inference, lower computational costs, and potential for on-device or local processing in clinical settings, thereby enhancing patient care, supporting diagnostic processes, and improving privacy by reducing reliance on large, remotely hosted models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring knowledge from large language models to smaller student models; however, conventional supervised KD often suffers from a distribution mismatch between training and inference. While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines.</p>
