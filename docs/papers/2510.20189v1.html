                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">SPAN (Suspicion Progression Analysis Network) introduces a paradigm shift in Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) by moving from discrete classification to continuous regression for modeling suspicious intentions in video surveillance. Leveraging insights from Temporal Point Process theory, SPAN defines a continuous suspicion score, integrates multimodal information to modulate suspicion coefficients, and links actions to predefined concepts for enhanced explainability. This approach significantly improves detection accuracy, particularly for subtle behavioral changes, enabling earlier intervention and greater utility in security applications.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>While primarily developed for video surveillance, the methodology of continuously modeling behavioral 'suspicion progression' and 'temporal intention localization' holds substantial medical relevance. It offers a powerful tool for proactively monitoring patient behavior in clinical or home settings, enabling early detection of subtle changes that could indicate impending adverse events, cognitive decline, mental health crises, or deviations from prescribed activities.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper's AI application is broadly defined for 'security applications,' its principles could be applied to biosecurity for enhanced surveillance and threat detection. For example, AI-powered video analytics to monitor restricted biological research facilities, detect unusual patterns of movement or activity around sensitive materials, or identify unauthorized personnel attempts, thereby providing an 'earlier detection and proactive intervention' mechanism against biothreats or accidental releases. However, the paper itself does not detail specific medical AI applications beyond this biosecurity relevance.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The continuous modeling of 'suspicion progression' can revolutionize patient monitoring by enabling the early identification of subtle behavioral changes that precede significant medical events. For example, continuous tracking could predict impending falls, detect early signs of agitation in psychiatric patients, or identify deviations from therapy protocols, allowing for timely, personalized, and proactive clinical interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes and safety. The inherent explainability of CAM also assists clinicians in understanding the 'why' behind an alert.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.</p>
