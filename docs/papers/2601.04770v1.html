                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SciIF, a novel multi-discipline benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability for "scientific instruction following." SciIF assesses LLMs' adherence to strict scientific constraints across conditions, semantics, and processes, demanding explicit evidence of compliance to ensure auditable and reliable scientific intelligence beyond mere final-answer correctness.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In medicine, where decision-making demands high accuracy, interpretability, and adherence to established protocols, SciIF's emphasis on verifiable scientific instruction following is crucial. It ensures LLMs applied in healthcare don't just provide correct answers but arrive at them through scientifically sound, transparent, and auditable reasoning pathways, enhancing patient safety and clinical trust.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a benchmark crucial for developing and validating medical AI applications that require strict adherence to scientific principles, ethical constraints, and specific protocols. For example, a medical AI assisting in diagnosis must follow established criteria and boundary conditions (e.g., patient age, comorbidities); an AI designing drug trials must adhere to experimental validity and regulatory constraints; and an AI for biosecurity must rigorously follow scientific protocols for risk assessment. SciIF helps ensure these AIs don't just 'get the right answer' but do so for the 'right reasons' with transparent and auditable steps, which is paramount for patient safety and scientific integrity in healthcare.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark comprising university-level problems. Each problem is evaluated against a fixed catalog of scientific constraints, systematically categorized into scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks), semantic stability (e.g., unit conventions), and specific processes (e.g., numerical methods). A key methodological aspect is the requirement for LLMs to provide explicit evidence of satisfying these constraints, alongside assessing the correctness of the final solution.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The paper's key contribution is identifying the critical deficiencies in existing LLM evaluation regarding scientific rigor and proposing SciIF as a robust solution. SciIF establishes that true scientific intelligence in LLMs requires verifiable adherence to complex constraints, not just accurate final answers. It enables the diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures and underscores the necessity of auditability for LLM reliability in scientific applications.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>SciIF will significantly enhance the trustworthiness and practical utility of AI in healthcare. By ensuring LLMs strictly adhere to medical guidelines, pharmacological principles, diagnostic protocols, and research methodologies, it can lead to safer AI-driven clinical decision support, more reliable drug interaction predictions, ethically sound personalized treatment plans, and robust scientific discovery pipelines in biomedicine. This explicit adherence reduces the risk of 'right answer for wrong reasons' scenarios, which are unacceptable in patient care.</p>

                <p>The abstract primarily highlights limitations of existing LLM benchmarks rather than SciIF itself.

                <p>Future work implied by SciIF includes developing LLMs inherently capable of generating explicit, auditable evidence for constraint satisfaction. It also suggests expanding such rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation methodologies across an even broader spectrum of scientific and medical disciplines, pushing for a new generation of truly 'rigorous scientific intelligence' in AI agents.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.</p>
