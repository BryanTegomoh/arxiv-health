                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>coTherapist is a unified framework built upon a small language model (SLM). Its engineering involves a multi-pronged approach: domain-specific fine-tuning to specialize the model for mental health contexts, retrieval augmentation (RAG) to ensure responses are grounded in current information, and agentic reasoning to simulate therapeutic competencies. Evaluation included quantitative analysis of responses to clinical queries for relevance and clinical grounding, psychometric profiling using a novel T-BARS rubric to assess empathy and personality traits, and qualitative human evaluation by domain experts who assessed response accuracy, trustworthiness, and safety. The system was also deployed and tested by clinical experts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Access to mental healthcare is increasingly strained by workforce shortages and rising demand, motivating the development of intelligent systems that can support mental healthcare experts. We introduce coTherapist, a unified framework utilizing a small language model to emulate core therapeutic competencies through domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and agentic reasoning. Evaluation on clinical queries demonstrates that coTherapist generates more relevant and clinically grounded responses than contemporary baselines. Using our novel T-BARS rubric and psychometric profiling, we confirm coTherapist exhibits high empathy and therapist-consistent personality traits. Furthermore, human evaluation by domain experts validates that coTherapist delivers accurate, trustworthy, and safe responses. coTherapist was deployed and tested by clinical experts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that small models can be engineered to exhibit expert-like behavior, offering a scalable pathway for digital mental health tools.</p>
