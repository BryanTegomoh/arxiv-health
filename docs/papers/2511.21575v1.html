                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance automated landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy, addressing the common limitation of models assuming a fixed Antero-Posterior view. It integrates a 2D/3D landmark registration loss into the training of a U-Net model to improve accuracy under variable patient or imaging unit orientations. The authors analyze the performance of this enhanced U-Net against baseline methods, particularly under realistic intra-operative conditions with varying patient pose.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate and robust automated landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy, even with varying patient poses, is crucial for improving real-time surgical guidance, diagnosis, and post-operative assessment. This reduces the need for manual adjustments and enhances the efficiency and safety of image-guided procedures.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an enhanced landmark detection model using deep learning (U-Net) and 2D/3D registration loss to accurately identify anatomical landmarks in pelvic fluoroscopy, particularly under variable patient positioning. This improves real-time anatomical understanding and guidance for medical professionals during intra-operative procedures, leading to more efficient and potentially safer interventions.</p>

                    <li>Current automated landmark detection methods in pelvic fluoroscopy typically assume a fixed Antero-Posterior (AP) view, which is often violated in real intra-operative settings.</li>
                    
                    <li>The proposed solution is a novel framework that incorporates a 2D/3D landmark registration loss directly into the training process of a U-Net landmark prediction model.</li>
                    
                    <li>This approach aims to make landmark detection more robust and accurate when the pelvis or imaging unit deviates from the standard AP orientation.</li>
                    
                    <li>Performance analysis involves comparing three models: a baseline U-Net, a U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss (PEL), and a U-Net fine-tuned with PEL.</li>
                    
                    <li>The evaluation is conducted under realistic intra-operative conditions designed to simulate variable patient pose.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes a novel framework where a U-Net landmark prediction model is trained using an additional 2D/3D landmark registration loss. This loss function presumably guides the U-Net to produce outputs that are consistent with 3D anatomical structures even when viewed from different 2D projections. The performance is evaluated by comparing a standard U-Net, a U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss (PEL), and a U-Net fine-tuned with PEL, specifically under conditions where patient pose is intentionally varied.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of automated anatomical structure and positioning understanding during image-guided pelvic procedures. By enabling robust landmark detection irrespective of patient or imaging unit orientation, it could lead to more precise surgical planning, reduced operative time, decreased radiation exposure (by minimizing repeated imaging for optimal views), and improved patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.</p>
