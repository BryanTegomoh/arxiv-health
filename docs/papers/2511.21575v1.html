                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework to enhance automated landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy, specifically addressing the challenge of variable patient or imaging unit orientation. It integrates a 2D/3D landmark registration loss directly into the training of a U-Net model, aiming to improve detection accuracy and robustness under realistic intra-operative conditions. The study analyzes the performance of this approach against baseline U-Net models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.</p>
