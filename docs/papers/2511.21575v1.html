                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing automated landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy, addressing the limitation of existing methods that assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view. It proposes integrating a 2D/3D landmark registration loss into the training of a U-Net model to improve accuracy under realistic intra-operative conditions with variable patient pose. The study analyzes the performance differences between a baseline U-Net, a U-Net trained with this Pose Estimation Loss, and a fine-tuned version.</p>

                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>Automated landmark detection is vital for understanding patient anatomy and positioning during intra-operative imaging in medical procedures.</li>
                    
                    <li>Current landmark detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy are limited by their assumption of a fixed Antero-Posterior (AP) view, which is often inaccurate in real clinical scenarios due to variable patient or imaging unit orientation.</li>
                    
                    <li>The proposed solution is a novel framework that incorporates a 2D/3D landmark registration loss function, termed "Pose Estimation Loss," directly into the training regimen of a U-Net deep learning model.</li>
                    
                    <li>This integration aims to make the landmark detection model significantly more robust to variations in patient or imaging unit orientation during fluoroscopy.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study conducts a comparative analysis of landmark detection accuracy across three models: a standard (baseline) U-Net, a U-Net trained from scratch with the new Pose Estimation Loss, and a U-Net initially trained then fine-tuned with this loss.</li>
                    
                    <li>Performance evaluation is specifically designed and conducted under realistic intra-operative scenarios to assess adaptability and accuracy under conditions of variable patient pose.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The research involves developing a novel framework that modifies the training objective of a U-Net convolutional neural network by integrating a 2D/3D landmark registration loss function, referred to as 'Pose Estimation Loss.' This loss guides the model to predict landmarks more accurately under varying orientations by leveraging 3D anatomical information. The methodology includes a comparative study analyzing the landmark detection performance of a standard U-Net, a U-Net trained entirely with the new loss, and a U-Net fine-tuned with the loss, all evaluated under conditions of variable patient pose.</p>

It supports safer and more efficient minimally invasive procedures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.</p>
