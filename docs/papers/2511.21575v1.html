                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance automated landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy, particularly addressing the limitation of current methods that assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view. It integrates 2D/3D landmark registration loss into the training process of a U-Net model to improve accuracy under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable. The authors detail a comparative analysis of their proposed method against baseline U-Net and a U-Net trained/fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a U-Net architecture for landmark prediction. The core innovation lies in integrating a 2D/3D landmark registration loss (referred to as Pose Estimation Loss) directly into the U-Net's training objective. Performance is evaluated by comparing a standard U-Net, a U-Net trained entirely with the new loss, and a U-Net initially trained conventionally and then fine-tuned with the registration loss, specifically under conditions of variable patient pose.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.</p>
