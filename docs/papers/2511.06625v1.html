                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary
and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of
lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these
domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and
shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning
Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a
single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that
emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then
reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a
cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three
synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung
abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their
cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes
structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic
cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically
grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality
prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.
Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning
that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between
pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work
establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from
LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based
medical interpretation.</p>
