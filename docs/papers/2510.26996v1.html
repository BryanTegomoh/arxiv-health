                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this study, we propose MoME, a Mixture of Visual Language Medical Experts,
for Medical Image Segmentation. MoME adapts the successful Mixture of Experts
(MoE) paradigm, widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), for medical
vision-language tasks. The architecture enables dynamic expert selection by
effectively utilizing multi-scale visual features tailored to the intricacies
of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.</p>
