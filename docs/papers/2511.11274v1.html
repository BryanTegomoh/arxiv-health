                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel modular framework for Polarization-Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PS-OCT) that significantly enhances its compatibility with standard commercial OCT systems. By integrating a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm, the system reconstructs tissue polarization properties from multiple measurements, reliably quantifying retardance and optic axis orientation. This innovation aims to overcome existing technical barriers, facilitating the widespread adoption of PS-OCT in both research and clinical environments.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This modular PS-OCT approach has the potential to revolutionize clinical diagnostics by providing a cost-effective and easily implementable tool for advanced tissue characterization. Its compatibility with existing OCT systems means clinics can upgrade their capabilities without extensive hardware overhaul, enabling non-invasive detection and monitoring of diseases linked to changes in tissue birefringence (e.g., glaucoma, neurodegeneration, cancer staging), thereby improving patient outcomes through earlier diagnosis and more precise treatment planning.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the abstract highlights solutions, the explicit mention of introducing a "retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy" suggests that mitigating random phase variations between the multiple required measurements is a critical challenge in sequential acquisition methods. The need for three or more repeated measurements implies a trade-off in acquisition speed compared to single-shot PS-OCT methods, although this is not explicitly discussed as a limitation in the abstract.</p>

This includes exploring its utility in various research fields and integrating it into routine clinical practice for a broader range of diagnostic and monitoring purposes beyond the retina.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) extends OCT by analyzing the polarization states of backscattered light to quantify tissue birefringence. However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.</p>
