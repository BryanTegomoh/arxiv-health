                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MAFM^3, a novel framework designed to adapt a single medical imaging foundation model to diverse tasks, domains, and modalities through lightweight modular components. This approach enables dynamic activation of specialized capabilities at inference, addressing data scarcity by avoiding separate pre-training for every scenario. Empirically, MAFM^3 improved performance on prognosis and segmentation tasks when adapting a chest CT model, and achieved a 5% Dice score improvement in multimodality segmentation by incorporating PET scans.</p>

                    <p>The MAFM^3 framework integrates lightweight modular components with a pre-trained foundation model. These modules are designed as task- and modality-specific 'skill sets' that are dynamically activated during inference based on the input imaging data and the desired clinical output. The empirical validation involved adapting a chest CT foundation model (initially trained for classification) to new tasks: prognosis and segmentation. Additionally, the framework's multimodality capabilities were tested by integrating PET scans alongside CT data for segmentation tasks, measuring performance improvements using metrics like Dice score.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.
