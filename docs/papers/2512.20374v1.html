                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the subjectivity and inter-observer variability of manual Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) scoring in colonoscopy by proposing a novel automated framework. Leveraging a newly constructed high-quality dataset, their method integrates the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a fecal-feature extraction branch, fusing global visual features with stool-related textual priors. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation, demonstrating superior performance over existing baselines.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate bowel preparation is paramount for effective colonoscopy, directly impacting the detection rate of adenomas and early cancers. Automating BBPS scoring can standardize preparation assessment, reduce costly repeat procedures due to inadequate preparation, and ultimately improve the diagnostic yield and patient safety in colorectal cancer screening.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper describes an AI application designed for automated, objective scoring of bowel preparation quality from colonoscopy images. The AI system leverages computer vision and natural language processing (CLIP) techniques to assist clinicians in evaluating bowel cleanliness, thereby reducing inter-observer variability and improving the consistency and efficacy of colonoscopy procedures. This falls under the domain of computer-aided diagnosis and analysis in medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed framework utilizes a CLIP model as its backbone, enhanced with adapter-based transfer learning for domain adaptation. A specialized fecal-feature extraction branch is integrated to specifically identify and process stool-related characteristics. The core innovation lies in fusing global visual features, derived from the image, with textual priors related to bowel contents and cleanliness (e.g., 'clear fluid,' 'stool remnant'). This fusion process allows for accurate BBPS scoring without requiring pixel-level segmentation of fecal matter.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.</p>
