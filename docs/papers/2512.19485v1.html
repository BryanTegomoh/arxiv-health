                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical need for reliable tumor monitoring to enable evolutionary therapy (ET) in metastatic cancers, particularly those lacking serum biomarkers like NSCLC. It demonstrates, using a virtual patient model, that current standard RECIST 1.1 criteria are inadequate, while 3D volumetric imaging accurately captures tumor burden and dynamics, which are essential for guiding ET.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for advancing personalized oncology by demonstrating how to overcome a major hurdle for evolutionary therapy in common metastatic cancers without biomarkers, potentially leading to more effective and adaptive patient-centered treatment strategies that control disease progression long-term.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper suggests integrating 'automated segmentation' of tumors from medical images (e.g., radiographic imaging) to accurately capture tumor burden and dynamics. This is a direct application of AI (specifically computer vision and machine learning) in medical image analysis for disease monitoring, treatment response assessment, and guiding therapeutic decisions in cancer care.</p>

                    <li>While some cancers (e.g., mCRPC, relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer) use serum biomarkers for ET guidance, many (e.g., metastatic NSCLC) lack reliable biomarkers, relying instead on radiographic imaging.</li>
                    
                    <li>Current radiographic assessment using RECIST 1.1 is insufficient for ET because it uses 1D measurements of a few lesions, defines progression relative to nadir, can miss early regrowth, underrepresent tumor burden, and obscure disease trends.</li>
                    
                    <li>A virtual NSCLC patient model was used to compare different measurement methodologies.</li>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Evolutionary therapy (ET) aims to steer tumor evolution by adjusting treatment timing and dosing to control rather than eradicate tumor burden. Clinical use requires reliable monitoring of tumor dynamics to inform mathematical models that guide therapy. In cancers such as metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, ET models are informed by serial serum biomarkers. For cancers lacking reliable biomarkers, such as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiographic imaging remains the primary method for treatment response assessment, typically using RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST, which tracks a few lesions with one-dimensional (1D) measurements and defines progression relative to the nadir, the smallest tumor burden recorded after treatment, was not designed to support ET. It may miss early regrowth, underrepresent tumor burden, and obscure disease trends. Using a virtual NSCLC patient model, we demonstrate that lesion selection and measurement dimensionality strongly affect progression detection. Two-dimensional metrics provide modest improvement, but only 3D volumetric measurements accurately capture both tumor burden and its dynamics, which are key requirements for ET. To support ET in cancers lacking biomarkers, response assessment must evolve beyond RECIST by integrating volumetric imaging, automated segmentation, and potentially liquid biopsies, alongside redefining progression criteria to enable adaptive, patient-centered treatments.</p>
