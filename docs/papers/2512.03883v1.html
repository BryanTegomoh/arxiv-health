                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Dual Cross-Attention Siamese Swin Transformer (SSDCA) for objective and early detection of local tumor regrowth in rectal cancer patients undergoing watch-and-wait surveillance using longitudinal endoscopy images. SSDCA effectively distinguishes local regrowth from complete clinical response by leveraging pretrained Swin transformers and a novel dual cross-attention mechanism to fuse features from two endoscopic scans without spatial alignment, achieving high balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness to image artifacts.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA). This model utilizes two branches, each with a pretrained Swin Transformer, to extract features from longitudinal endoscopic image pairs (restaging and follow-up). A dual cross-attention mechanism is then applied to integrate and emphasize features from both scans, specifically designed to function without requiring explicit spatial alignment of the images. The model was trained on image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a distinct held-out dataset comprising image pairs from 62 patients. Performance metrics included balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and robustness analysis against artifacts. UMAP clustering was used to assess the discriminative quality of the learned feature representations.</p>

                    <p>SSDCA achieved superior performance over baseline models with a balanced accuracy of 81.76% ± 0.04, sensitivity of 90.07% ± 0.08 (for local regrowth detection), and specificity of 72.86% ± 0.05 (for complete clinical response). The model exhibited strong robustness to various endoscopic artifacts. Furthermore, UMAP clustering of the extracted features confirmed highly discriminative representation learning, showing maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 ± 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 ± 0.19) for distinguishing between cCR and LR.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The SSDCA model has the potential to significantly improve the precision and timeliness of care for rectal cancer patients managed with a watch-and-wait approach. By providing an objective and highly accurate method for early detection of local regrowth from routine endoscopy, it can empower clinicians to make more informed decisions, prevent disease progression, tailor treatment strategies, and potentially spare patients from unnecessary invasive procedures, thereby enhancing patient safety and quality of life.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.</p>
