                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Dual Cross-Attention Siamese Transformer (SSDCA), a novel deep learning model designed for the early and objective detection of local tumor regrowth in rectal cancer patients undergoing watch-and-wait surveillance. By analyzing longitudinal endoscopic images from restaging and follow-up, SSDCA accurately distinguishes clinical complete response from local regrowth, achieving high sensitivity and robustness to imaging variations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly medically relevant as it provides an objectively accurate and robust method for the early detection of local tumor regrowth in rectal cancer patients undergoing watch-and-wait surveillance. This is critical for optimizing patient management, enabling timely intervention to prevent disease progression, and ultimately improving outcomes by averting distant metastases.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved developing a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA). This architecture uses pretrained Swin Transformers to extract robust, domain-agnostic features from longitudinal endoscopic image pairs (restaging and follow-up). Dual cross-attention then processes these features, emphasizing crucial information across the two scans without requiring explicit spatial alignment. The model was trained on image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of 62 patients, comparing its performance against Swin-based baselines. Robustness to image artifacts and discriminative feature learning via UMAP clustering were also assessed.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.</p>
