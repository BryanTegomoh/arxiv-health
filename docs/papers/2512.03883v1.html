                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Dual Cross-Attention Siamese Transformer (SSDCA) for early and objective detection of local rectal tumor regrowth (LR) in patients undergoing watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance. By combining longitudinal endoscopy images with a novel dual cross-attention mechanism, SSDCA achieved superior balanced accuracy (81.76%), sensitivity (90.07%), and specificity (72.86%) in distinguishing complete response from LR. The model demonstrated robustness to image artifacts and strong discriminative feature learning, addressing a critical need in rectal cancer patient management.</p>

                    <p>The study developed a Dual Cross-Attention Siamese Swin Transformer (SSDCA) model. This architecture employs two parallel Swin Transformers, pretrained for robust feature extraction, to process longitudinal endoscopic image pairs (one from restaging, one from follow-up).

The model was trained on image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of 62 patients.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The SSDCA model offers a potential breakthrough for clinical practice by providing an objective, automated, and early detection system for local tumor regrowth in rectal cancer patients under watch-and-wait surveillance. This could lead to more timely and appropriate interventions, improved patient outcomes, reduced clinician subjectivity, and more efficient allocation of clinical resources by accurately identifying patients who require treatment vs. those who can safely continue surveillance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.</p>
