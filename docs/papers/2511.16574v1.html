                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces "Erase to Retain," a novel framework for controllable unlearning in medical segmentation networks that leverages a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The method selectively erases lesion-specific or class-specific representations from low-rank decoder spaces through adversarial optimization on a designated forget subset, while preserving global anatomical understanding and overall performance on retained data. Experimental results demonstrate successful targeted forgetting across ISIC segmentation/classification and CHASE datasets, consistently lowering forget-set IoU/accuracy while maintaining or improving utility on retain and validation sets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The method, 'Erase to Retain,' operates on a teacher-student distillation paradigm. The student network is equipped with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules in its decoder spaces. In the 'strong unlearning phase,' these LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to generate predictions that deliberately contradict the confident predictions of the teacher network on a designated 'forget subset.' This adversarial training targets the removal of specific semantic knowledge (e.g., lesion features). Subsequently, a 'gentle restoration phase' employs head-only supervised refinement on the 'retained dataset' to recover and maintain the student network's overall generalization capabilities and utility.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The framework successfully achieves targeted forgetting, evidenced by a significant drop in performance metrics on the forget subset (e.g., ISIC segmentation IoU from 0.875 to 0.509, ISIC classification accuracy from 87.0% to 64.1%). Simultaneously, it effectively preserves or enhances performance on the retained and validation datasets (e.g., ISIC segmentation IoU improved from 0.647 to 0.677, ISIC classification retain accuracy from 83.9% to 90.6%). This demonstrates that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical, controllable, and reversible mechanism for selective knowledge removal in medical image analysis.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a vital tool for the responsible and compliant deployment of AI in clinical settings. It enables healthcare organizations to meet privacy regulations (like GDPR and HIPAA) by selectively removing sensitive patient data from trained models. Clinicians can benefit from AI models that can be efficiently updated to forget outdated or incorrect information, adapt to new ethical guidelines, or respond to 'right to be forgotten' requests without the immense computational cost of retraining from scratch. This fosters greater trust and flexibility in using AI for medical diagnostics and image interpretation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.</p>
