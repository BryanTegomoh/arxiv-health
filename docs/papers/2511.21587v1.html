                    <p>The paper presents an instructional guide on Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC). The methodology involves an example-driven, step-by-step approach to implementing and applying ABC-SMC.

                <p>This computational framework has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of models used in clinical and public health settings. By enabling robust parameter inference for complex disease models (e.g., infectious disease transmission, drug metabolism, tumor growth) that lack tractable likelihoods, it can lead to better predictions of disease outbreaks, optimized drug dosing regimens, and more informed resource allocation, ultimately advancing precision medicine and public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems.
