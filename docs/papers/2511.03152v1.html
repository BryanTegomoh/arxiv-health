                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment of AI systems, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges to predict and explain risks. It generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies highlighting agreements and disagreements on risks, demonstrated across domains including medical AI, and proposes an interactive visualization for conflict reasoning. The findings emphasize that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns, advocating for transparent, human-centered AI governance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is highly relevant for the responsible and ethical deployment of AI in healthcare, as it provides a structured method to identify, understand, and address the diverse risk perceptions among critical stakeholders like clinicians, patients, administrators, and regulators. By making these varied perspectives explicit, it facilitates the development of safer, more trusted, and effectively governed medical AI systems.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper focuses on an LLM-based framework designed to predict, explain, and manage stakeholder-specific risks associated with AI systems. Its application to 'medical AI' means it addresses how different stakeholders (e.g., patients, clinicians, regulators, developers) perceive and potentially conflict over risks (e.g., diagnostic accuracy, patient safety, data privacy, bias) in AI tools used in healthcare. The framework generates interpretable policies to navigate these conflicts, enhancing transparency and alignment with human-centered AI governance goals specifically within the medical context.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The framework employs Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as 'judges' to predict and generate explanations for AI system risks. It integrates the Risk Atlas Nexus for systematic risk modeling and a GloVE (Global Vectors for Word Representation, or a similar explanation method) approach to create stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies. These policies articulate areas of agreement and disagreement among stakeholders regarding specific risks. An interactive visualization tool is further proposed to illustrate the emergence and reasoning behind stakeholder conflicts.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings reveal that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence both the perception of risks associated with AI systems and the patterns of conflict that emerge from these differing viewpoints. The framework effectively generates transparent, stakeholder-specific policies that elucidate where agreement and disagreement lie, enhancing interpretability of risk assessment.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state specific limitations of the proposed framework. However, potential inherent limitations could include the fidelity of LLMs in accurately simulating complex human stakeholder perspectives and biases, the challenge of grounding LLM-generated explanations in real-world clinical or regulatory contexts, and the scalability of the approach across an exhaustive set of stakeholders and AI use cases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is
essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for
stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict
and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our
framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how
different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate
our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous
vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive
visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder
perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show
that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and
conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these
stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more
transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance
goals.</p>
