                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pathology is advancing
precision medicine by improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient
outcomes. Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and
morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their
gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and
analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain
normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by
fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight,
open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI
preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation
management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with
modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines
WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of
AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and
downstream analysis.</p>
