                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The AUDRON framework is a hybrid deep learning model that processes raw acoustic data. It extracts two primary types of acoustic features: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. These features are then fed into a complex neural network architecture that incorporates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial pattern recognition (likely on spectrograms), recurrent layers (such as LSTMs or GRUs) for modeling temporal dependencies in the sound sequences, and autoencoder-based representations for learning robust, compressed feature vectors. A feature-level fusion strategy is employed to combine the information derived from these diverse processing streams before passing it to a final classification layer.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used across diverse domains, including logistics, agriculture, surveillance, and defense. While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited.</p>
