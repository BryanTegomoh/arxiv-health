                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Bayesian semiparametric methodology for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) from high-dimensional observational data within the potential outcomes framework. It achieves this through a Bayesian debiasing procedure and targeted modeling based on debiased summary statistics, which, combined with sample splitting, ensures robustness and asymptotic efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is highly relevant for medicine as it provides a robust and efficient statistical tool to estimate the effectiveness of treatments and interventions from real-world observational patient data, especially where complex patient characteristics are high-dimensional and traditional randomized controlled trials are impractical.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This methodology can serve as a crucial statistical backbone for medical AI applications that aim to infer causal relationships from large, observational health datasets. AI models often struggle with confounding and correlation vs. causation. By providing a 'doubly robust' and 'targeted' method for estimating treatment effects, it enables AI systems to: 1) develop more reliable evidence-based treatment recommendations; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of health interventions and policies in real-world settings; 3) power personalized medicine algorithms that predict individual responses to treatments by correctly accounting for complex confounders; and 4) enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI in healthcare by moving beyond associative findings to causal insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose a semiparametric Bayesian methodology for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) within the potential outcomes framework using observational data with high-dimensional nuisance parameters. Our method introduces a Bayesian debiasing procedure that corrects for bias arising from nuisance estimation and employs a targeted modeling strategy based on summary statistics rather than the full data. These summary statistics are identified in a debiased manner, enabling the estimation of nuisance bias via weighted observables and facilitating hierarchical learning of the ATE. By combining debiasing with sample splitting, our approach separates nuisance estimation from inference on the target parameter, reducing sensitivity to nuisance model specification. We establish that, under mild conditions, the marginal posterior for the ATE satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises theorem when both nuisance models are correctly specified and remains consistent and robust when only one is correct, achieving Bayesian double robustness. This ensures asymptotic efficiency and frequentist validity. Extensive simulations confirm the theoretical results, demonstrating accurate point estimation and credible intervals with nominal coverage, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed framework can also be extended to other causal estimands, and its key principles offer a general foundation for advancing Bayesian semiparametric inference more broadly.</p>
