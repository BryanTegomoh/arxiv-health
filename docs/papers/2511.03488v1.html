                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>NAP utilizes an attention-based late fusion architecture. It takes predictions generated by multiple *frozen, pretrained single-channel deep learning models* as its input streams. A tri-axial attention mechanism then processes these streams, learning to weigh and combine them based on temporal dynamics, spatial relationships (between channels/modalities), and the specific characteristics of each predictor. This adaptive aggregation results in a unified, robust sleep stage prediction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.</p>
