                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed NAP, a Neural Aggregator of Predictions, which is an attention-based late fusion model. It operates by taking prediction streams from 'frozen, pretrained single-channel models' as input. The core of NAP is a 'tri-axial attention mechanism' that learns to weigh these streams based on temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. The model is designed to adapt to different input dimensions and was trained and evaluated on its ability to generalize across diverse polysomnography datasets without specific retraining, a concept known as zero-shot generalization.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.</p>
