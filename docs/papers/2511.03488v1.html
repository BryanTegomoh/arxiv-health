                    <p>The methodology centers on NAP, a neural aggregator model that operates on a late fusion principle. It takes prediction outputs from multiple *frozen, pretrained single-channel models* as its input.

                    <p>The main findings are that NAP consistently surpasses the performance of individual single-channel predictors and basic ensemble methods in automated sleep staging. Crucially, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across various datasets, indicating its superior ability to perform accurately on new, unseen data without requiring specific retraining for each dataset.</p>

                <p>The clinical impact is significant, as NAP can substantially improve the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of sleep disorder diagnosis by providing more reliable automated sleep staging. Its zero-shot generalization capability is particularly valuable, enabling seamless deployment across different clinical sites with varying PSG equipment and protocols, thereby reducing human scoring burden and standardizing diagnoses.</p>

However, as an approach relying on aggregating outputs from pretrained single-channel models (late fusion), it inherently depends on the quality and diversity of these individual predictors. The explicit scope of the paper, as presented in the abstract, focuses on its strengths and generalizability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.</p>
