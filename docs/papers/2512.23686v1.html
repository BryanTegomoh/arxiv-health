                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">ProfASR-Bench addresses the limitations of current ASR benchmarks for high-stakes professional speech, particularly in medical settings, by introducing a context-conditioned evaluation suite with entity-aware metrics. The study reveals a "context-utilization gap" (CUG), demonstrating that state-of-the-art ASR models largely fail to leverage even oracle textual context to improve recognition accuracy. This benchmark provides a critical tool for developing ASR systems that can effectively utilize side information in domains with dense terminology and low error tolerance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is critically important for medicine as it directly addresses the inherent challenges of ASR in clinical environments, where dense medical terminology and near-zero tolerance for errors in critical entities (e.g., patient names, drug dosages, diagnoses) are paramount. Improving context utilization can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ASR systems for medical dictation, clinical documentation, and telehealth applications.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research directly contributes to improving AI applications in health, specifically those relying on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This includes automating the transcription of medical consultations, physician dictations for clinical notes, generating summaries from patient-provider interactions, voice control for medical devices, and enhancing AI-driven diagnostic tools that process spoken input. The focus on context-conditioned recognition and entity-aware scoring is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of AI in medical settings.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>ProfASR-Bench was developed as an evaluation suite comprising natural-language prompts (domain cues, speaker profiles) paired with entity-rich target utterances. It supports conventional ASR metrics, entity-aware scores, and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. The benchmark was utilized to evaluate Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) across five distinct context conditions: no-context, speaker profile only, domain cue plus speaker profile, oracle (perfect) context, and adversarial prompts.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the identification of a "context-utilization gap" (CUG). It was consistently observed that current state-of-the-art ASR systems, even when provided with optimal "oracle" textual context prompts, demonstrate negligible improvement in average Word Error Rate (WER). Furthermore, adversarial prompts failed to reliably degrade performance, indicating a fundamental inability of these systems to robustly integrate and leverage readily available side information for improved recognition.</p>

            </div>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings highlight a significant barrier to the robust deployment of ASR in high-stakes clinical settings. Successfully closing the context-utilization gap could lead to dramatically more accurate medical dictation and automated clinical note generation, reducing critical entity errors and minimizing the need for extensive human review. This would enhance clinician efficiency, alleviate documentation burden, and potentially improve patient safety by ensuring higher fidelity in capturing medical information.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study primarily reveals limitations inherent in current state-of-the-art ASR systems themselves, rather than the benchmark. Specifically, current ASR models were found to be nominally promptable but largely underutilize readily available side information, even when that information is perfectly provided (oracle prompts). This suggests a core architectural or training limitation in how these systems integrate and leverage external context.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>ProfASR-Bench is intended to serve as a reproducible testbed for comparing various context fusion strategies across different ASR model families. Future research should concentrate on developing novel architectures and training methodologies that can effectively integrate and leverage contextual cues (such as domain-specific knowledge and speaker profiles) to significantly improve recognition accuracy, especially for critical entities in demanding professional domains like medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.
