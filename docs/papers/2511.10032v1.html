                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research investigates the critical challenge of aligning AI with human moral preferences in high-stakes domains, noting that such preferences are often dynamic rather than static. Grounded in kidney allocation, the study reveals significant temporal instability in participants' responses and decision-making models, leading to decreased predictive performance of AI systems over time. The findings highlight the urgent need for AI alignment methods to account for evolving human preferences to ensure trustworthiness and prevent harm.</p>

                <p>This study underscores that AI systems designed for critical medical decision-making, such as organ allocation, risk inherent bias and suboptimal outcomes if they assume static human moral preferences. Future clinical AI applications must develop mechanisms to continuously monitor and adapt to the temporal evolution of human ethical reasoning, ensuring that AI-driven recommendations remain aligned with current societal and individual values to maintain trust and ethical integrity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.</p>
