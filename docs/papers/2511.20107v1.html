                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel training-free framework for Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD), a critical task for language learning and speech therapy. Unlike conventional methods requiring complex model training, their approach leverages retrieval techniques with a pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. The method achieves accurate detection and diagnosis of pronunciation errors, demonstrating a superior F1 score of 69.60% on the L2-ARCTIC dataset without the computational complexity of model training.</p>

                <p>This technology offers a streamlined, objective tool for speech-language pathologists to identify and diagnose articulation and phonological disorders, mispronunciations in second language learners, or accent issues. It can significantly enhance the efficiency and precision of speech therapy and rehabilitation programs.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed method is a training-free, retrieval-based framework for MDD. It leverages a pre-existing, pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Instead of training phoneme-level models or scoring models, it uses retrieval techniques to compare target pronunciations with a speaker's actual pronunciation, allowing for the detection and diagnosis of errors without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or model training.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) is crucial for language learning and speech therapy. Unlike conventional methods that require scoring models or training phoneme-level models, we propose a novel training-free framework that leverages retrieval techniques with a pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition model. Our method avoids phoneme-specific modeling or additional task-specific training, while still achieving accurate detection and diagnosis of pronunciation errors. Experiments on the L2-ARCTIC dataset show that our method achieves a superior F1 score of 69.60% while avoiding the complexity of model training.</p>
