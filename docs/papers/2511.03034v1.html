                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses critical gaps in Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for high-demand, low-resource domains like healthcare, focusing on data-efficient adaptation and improved evaluation. It introduces a novel flexible evaluation method (FTS-OBP) for generative models and demonstrates that small decoder-only language models (SLMs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance on ABSA tasks with significantly less data (200-1,000 examples) and computational resources via a multitask fine-tuning strategy, surpassing proprietary large models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and health as it directly addresses the pressing need for fine-grained sentiment analysis (ABSA) in low-resource healthcare domains. By enabling accurate ABSA with minimal data and computational resources, it offers a scalable solution for extracting actionable insights from patient feedback, clinical notes, and health reviews where data scarcity, privacy concerns, and annotation costs are significant barriers.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research directly contributes to developing AI applications for sentiment analysis in healthcare. Specifically, it enables the practical deployment of fine-grained opinion mining (ABSA) for tasks such as analyzing patient feedback from surveys or online reviews to identify specific aspects of care (e.g., wait times, staff empathy, treatment effectiveness) that evoke positive or negative sentiment. It also facilitates analyzing sentiment in clinical notes, internal communications, or public health discussions. The focus on data-efficient adaptation and smaller models makes these AI solutions more viable for healthcare organizations with limited domain-specific data or computational infrastructure.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved proposing and validating a novel evaluation method (FTS-OBP) to handle boundary variations in generative ABSA outputs. It then systematically investigated small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs, <7B parameters), exploring data-free techniques (in-context learning, weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning.

                    <p>The FTS-OBP evaluation method provides a more realistic assessment of generative ABSA models, correlating strongly with traditional metrics while offering fine-grained diagnostics. Small Language Models (1.5-3.8B parameters) can surpass proprietary large models and achieve near-benchmark ABSA performance.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to develop high-performing, fine-grained sentiment analysis tools with limited data and computational resources has transformative clinical impact. It allows healthcare providers to rapidly analyze patient feedback on specific aspects of care (e.g., 'doctor's empathy,' 'appointment scheduling,' 'medication side effects') even for specialized clinics or rare conditions. This democratizes advanced NLP, enabling smaller institutions or regions with fewer resources to leverage AI for improving patient satisfaction, identifying specific areas for operational improvement, and enhancing overall quality of care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining
approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific
entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid
growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in
commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet
low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation
challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive
in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.
Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly
rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent
the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through
three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text
Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates
realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation
with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present
the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;
<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education
review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and
weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask
fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling
1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark
results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first
public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in
low-resource domains.</p>
