                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a novel framework designed to address the critical issue of poorly calibrated predictive uncertainty in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) models, particularly relevant for high-stakes domains like healthcare. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, acting as a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free module compatible with any TTA method. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SICL significantly reduces calibration error by an average of 13 percentage points compared to conventional calibration approaches.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SICL operates by estimating instance-wise correctness likelihood. It achieves this by generating multiple style-altered variants of an input instance and then measuring the consistency of the model's predictions across these variants. This process leverages only the model's forward pass, allowing SICL to function as a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method without requiring modifications to the original model or its training pipeline.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to obtain robust and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from AI models adapting to real-world, dynamic medical data is critical for safe and effective clinical integration. SICL's improvements can lead to safer AI deployments by allowing clinicians to better discern when an AI's prediction is truly confident versus when it is uncertain and requires human review. This can reduce the risk of AI-induced errors, enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize treatment planning, and accelerate the adoption of trustworthy AI solutions in diverse clinical settings, especially where patient data characteristics may evolve over time.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables efficient adaptation of deployed models, yet it often leads to poorly calibrated predictive uncertainty - a critical issue in high-stakes domains such as autonomous driving, finance, and healthcare. Existing calibration methods typically assume fixed models or static distributions, resulting in degraded performance under real-world, dynamic test conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, requiring only the model's forward pass. This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method. Comprehensive evaluations across four baselines, five TTA methods, and two realistic scenarios with three model architecture demonstrate that SICL reduces calibration error by an average of 13 percentage points compared to conventional calibration approaches.</p>
