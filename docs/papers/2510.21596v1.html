                    <p>The study developed two deep learning models: a feature-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

                <p>This automated interictal epileptic spike detection method holds substantial clinical impact by addressing the current laborious and error-prone manual process. It offers the potential for significantly faster and more consistent detection, which can accelerate presurgical evaluation in drug-resistant epilepsy, reduce the workload on highly skilled clinicians, and ultimately improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.</p>
