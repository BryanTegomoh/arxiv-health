                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) employs proton radiation rather than conventional X-rays to treat cancerous tumors. This approach offers significant advantages by minimizing the radiation exposure of surrounding healthy tissue, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects compared to traditional X-ray therapy. To ensure patient safety, each treatment plan must be experimentally validated before clinical implementation. However, current dosimetry devices face limitations in performing angled beam measurements and obtaining multi-depth assessments, both of which are essential for verifying IMPT treatment plans. In this study, the performance of a β-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector with a low-noise amplifier is studied and evaluated under various proton radiation doses and energy levels delivered by a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The detector performance is also compared with that of an ionization chamber. The β-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector exhibits a linear response with proton dose for single-spot irradiations, and its response to varying proton energies closely matches both the ion chamber data and simulated dose distributions. These findings highlight the potential of β-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based detectors as robust dosimetry devices for IMPT applications.</p>
