                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper focuses on developing a physics-based multiscale computational model for simulating blood circulation and cerebral autoregulation. While it uses 'image-informed' data and provides a 'tool for investigating cerebral flow regulation,' it does not describe the use or development of AI methods (e.g., machine learning, deep learning) for diagnosis, prediction, or intervention. It is a sophisticated computational modeling tool that could potentially *inform* or be integrated into future AI-driven diagnostic or treatment planning systems, but it is not an AI application itself.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Cerebral hemodynamics is fundamentally regulated by the Circle of Willis (CoW), which redistributes flow through communicating arteries to stabilize perfusion under anatomical variations and vascular stenosis. In this study, we develop a multiscale circulation model by coupling a systemic hemodynamic framework with a cerebral arterial network reconstructed from medical imaging. The model incorporates a cerebral autoregulation mechanism (CAM) and enables quantitative simulation of flow redistribution within the CoW under normal, anatomically varied, and stenotic conditions. Baseline simulations reproduce physiological flow distributions in which communicating arteries remain nearly inactive, showing negligible cross-flow and agreement with clinical measurements. In contrast, anatomical variations reveal distinct collateral activation patterns: the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) emerges as the earliest and most sensitive functional collateral, whereas the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) exhibit structure-dependent engagement. Progressive stenosis simulations further demonstrate a transition from a complete CoW to a fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (PCA) configuration, characterized by early ACoA flow reversal followed by ipsilateral PCoA activation, consistent with experimental and transcranial Doppler observations. Finally, a path-based quantitative analysis is introduced to illustrate how the cerebral vascular network dynamically reconfigures collateral pathways in response to structural changes. Overall, the proposed framework provides a physiologically interpretable, image-informed tool for investigating cerebral flow regulation through functional collaterals within the CoW, with potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cerebrovascular diseases.</p>
