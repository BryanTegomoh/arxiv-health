                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">HEAD-QA v2 is an expanded and updated multilingual healthcare multiple-choice reasoning dataset, now comprising over 12,000 questions derived from a decade of Spanish professional exams. This resource serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that model scale and intrinsic reasoning ability are the primary drivers of performance, with complex inference strategies yielding only limited additional gains.</p>

                    <p>The authors expanded the HEAD-QA dataset by compiling over 12,000 multiple-choice questions from ten years of Spanish professional healthcare exams. They then benchmarked several open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) on this expanded dataset, evaluating performance using different inference strategies: direct prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and probability-based answer selection.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Performance of Large Language Models on complex healthcare reasoning tasks is primarily determined by their inherent scale and intrinsic reasoning abilities. Advanced inference strategies like RAG or specialized prompting mechanisms offered only marginal improvements, suggesting that the core reasoning capacity of the models is a more dominant factor than strategy refinement.</p>

                <p>By providing a rigorous and expanded benchmark for medical reasoning, this research facilitates the development of more reliable and accurate AI tools for clinical practice. Improved LLMs could assist clinicians in navigating complex diagnostic pathways, accessing evidence-based information efficiently, and supporting medical education, ultimately leading to enhanced patient care and reduced cognitive burden on healthcare professionals.</p>

                <p>The abstract highlights that complex inference strategies (e.g., prompting, RAG, probability-based answer selection) achieved only "limited gains." This suggests that current LLM architectures or the methods of integrating these strategies may not yet fully leverage their potential for complex medical reasoning, or that inherent model capabilities currently overshadow strategic refinements.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We introduce HEAD-QA v2, an expanded and updated version of a Spanish/English healthcare multiple-choice reasoning dataset originally released by Vilares and Gómez-Rodríguez (2019). The update responds to the growing need for high-quality datasets that capture the linguistic and conceptual complexity of healthcare reasoning. We extend the dataset to over 12,000 questions from ten years of Spanish professional exams, benchmark several open-source LLMs using prompting, RAG, and probability-based answer selection, and provide additional multilingual versions to support future work. Results indicate that performance is mainly driven by model scale and intrinsic reasoning ability, with complex inference strategies obtaining limited gains. Together, these results establish HEAD-QA v2 as a reliable resource for advancing research on biomedical reasoning and model improvement.</p>
