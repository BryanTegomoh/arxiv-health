                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an in-silico model of the aorta and its spinal cord-supplying branches to characterize haemodynamic changes following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). It found a significant 51.86% decrease in spinal cord blood flow post-EVAR due to vessel exclusion, alongside compensatory flow increases in non-spinal territories and changes in wall shear stress metrics.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized SimVascular, an open-source software, to retrospectively construct patient-specific 3D anatomical models of a 76-year-old female's aorta and its major branches, including critical spinal cord-supplying vessels, from pre- and post-uncomplicated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) imaging.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Post-EVAR, blood flow through segmental arteries to the spinal cord territory significantly decreased by 51.86%, primarily due to the exclusion of lumbar and posterior intercostal arteries by the stent graft. Spinal cord-supplying arteries exhibited an increased Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS) of +5.2% and reduced Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP), with minimal change in Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI). Concurrently, a modest compensatory redistribution of flow was observed, with increases of approximately 6% in non-spinal vascular beds including the legs (+6.09%), reno-visceral vessels (+5.89%), and supra-aortic branches (+5.97%). Across all vascular territories, visceral arteries demonstrated the highest TAWSS and lowest RRT/ECAP, while leg arteries had the lowest TAWSS and highest RRT/ECAP, and supra-aortic vessels displayed the highest OSI.</p>

                <p>This study provides a fundamental computational framework for predicting the risk of spinal cord ischemia (SCI) following aortic aneurysm repair. It may facilitate personalized preoperative risk stratification, inform optimal surgical planning to preserve critical spinal cord blood supply, and potentially guide the development of prophylactic strategies to mitigate SCI risk in patients undergoing complex aortic interventions.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>A notable methodological limitation is the assumption of rigid vessel walls during the simulations. This simplification does not account for the dynamic, compliant nature of arterial walls in vivo, which could influence haemodynamic parameters and flow distribution.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aims: To develop an in-silico model of the aorta and its spinal cord-supplying branches, and to characterise haemodynamic changes following aortic aneurysm (AA) repair with such a model. The work is motivated by the risk of spinal cord ischaemia (SCI) and paraplegia, serious complications that can arise from disruption of spinal cord perfusion during AA surgery. Methods: SimVascular was used to retrospectively create models of a 76 year old female patient's aorta pre- and post- uncomplicated endovascular AA repair. The full extent of the aorta and its branches, including vessels supplying the spinal cord, was segmented. Pulsatile flow simulations were conducted under the assumption of rigid vessel walls, with patient-specific inlet and three-element Windkessel models for the outlet boundary conditions on the SimVascular Gateway Cluster. Results: Postoperatively, segmental artery flow to the spinal cord decreased by 51.86% due to exclusion of lumbar and posterior intercostal arteries by the stent graft. Spinal cord-supplying arteries showed increased TAWSS (+5.2%) and reduced RRT and ECAP, with minimal change in OSI. Consistent with redistribution away from the spinal territory, modest postoperative flow increases were observed in non-spinal vascular beds, including the legs (+6.09%), reno-visceral vessels (+5.89%), and supra-aortic branches (+5.97%). Across vascular territories, visceral arteries had the highest TAWSS and lowest RRT and ECAP, while leg arteries had the lowest TAWSS and highest RRT and ECAP; supra-aortic vessels exhibited the highest OSI. Conclusion: This study lays a foundation for computational prediction of SCI risk. It leverages in-silico modelling, using an open-source software pipeline and routine medical imaging, to assess spinal cord blood flow alterations after aortic surgery. This may forge a path towards a clinical decision-making tool.</p>
