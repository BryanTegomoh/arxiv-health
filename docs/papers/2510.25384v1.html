                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SQPsych, an LLM-driven pipeline for generating synthetic therapist-client dialogues based on structured client profiles and psychological questionnaires, addressing the scarcity of real therapy data. Utilizing open-weight LLMs to comply with data privacy regulations, the framework simulates CBT-based conversations for conditions like anxiety and depression. The resulting fine-tuned models, SQPsychLLM, demonstrate strong performance in therapeutic skills, highlighting the potential of synthetic data for scalable and data-secure AI in mental health.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, inherent challenges with synthetic data include potential biases introduced during generation, the difficulty of perfectly capturing the nuanced unpredictability of real human interaction, and complex clinical scenarios not fully represented by structured questionnaires. The fidelity of simulated CBT principles compared to real-world clinical application also warrants further investigation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at
