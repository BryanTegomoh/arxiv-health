                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">EfficientXpert proposes a lightweight domain-pruning framework to enable the deployment of specialized large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments. By integrating a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) and an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon) into the LoRA fine-tuning process, it transforms general models into sparse, domain-adapted experts in a single step. The method achieved up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity on health and legal tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for domain-specialized variants in areas such as law, healthcare, and finance. However, their large size remains a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or incur high overhead. In this work, we propose \textbf{EfficientXpert}, a lightweight domain-pruning framework that combines a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon). Integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process, EfficientXpert enables a one-step transformation of general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts. Across health and legal tasks, it retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals substantial domain-dependent structural shifts that degrade the effectiveness of general pruning masks, underscoring the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.</p>
