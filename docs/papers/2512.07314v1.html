                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">M-STAR (Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal AutoRegression) is a novel framework designed to generate long-term human mobility trajectories, overcoming the limitations of previous AI-generated content (AIGC) methods regarding inefficiency and lack of explicit multi-scale modeling. It achieves this through a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process, leveraging a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer and a Transformer-based decoder. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate M-STAR's superior fidelity and significantly improved generation speed compared to existing methods.</p>

                    <p>M-STAR implements a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process. This involves a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer, which hierarchically encodes mobility patterns at various spatial and temporal scales into tokens.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Modeling human mobility is vital for extensive applications such as transportation planning and epidemic modeling. With the rise of the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) paradigm, recent works explore synthetic trajectory generation using autoregressive and diffusion models. While these methods show promise for generating single-day trajectories, they remain limited by inefficiencies in long-term generation (e.g., weekly trajectories) and a lack of explicit spatiotemporal multi-scale modeling. This study proposes Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal AutoRegression (M-STAR), a new framework that generates long-term trajectories through a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process. M-STAR combines a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer that encodes hierarchical mobility patterns with a Transformer-based decoder for next-scale autoregressive prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that M-STAR outperforms existing methods in fidelity and significantly improves generation speed.
