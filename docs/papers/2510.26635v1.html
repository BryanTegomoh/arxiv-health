                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.</p>
