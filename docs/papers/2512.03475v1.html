                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a novel probabilistic framework designed to infer disease progression in individuals affected by mixed pathologies, a common scenario in neurodegeneration. Unlike standard Event-Based Models (EBMs) that assume a single disease, JPM treats individual disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over their joint progression. The framework demonstrates improved ordering accuracy (approximately 21% over a strong baseline) in synthetic experiments and produces results consistent with existing literature for mixed Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia progression using NACC data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This model provides a more sophisticated and realistic approach to understanding the complex, multi-pathology progression prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases. This can lead to earlier, more accurate diagnosis and the development of personalized treatment strategies that account for the simultaneous progression of multiple conditions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research develops a probabilistic machine learning framework (Joint Progression Model - JPM) to infer and model the progression of mixed pathologies (multiple co-occurring diseases) from cross-sectional data. This AI application aims to improve the understanding and prediction of complex disease trajectories in conditions like Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia, which can aid in earlier diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and potentially more targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with mixed neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Joint Progression Model (JPM) is a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease progression paths as partial rankings. It then constructs a prior over possible joint progressions, effectively combining these individual trajectories. The paper evaluates several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, Mallows) against properties such as calibration, separation, and sharpness. Performance is benchmarked against a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) using both synthetic datasets and real-world clinical data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) for analyzing AD and VaD mixed pathologies.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has the potential to enhance the precision of disease staging and prognosis for patients suffering from mixed neurodegenerative conditions, which are often clinically challenging to differentiate. By offering a granular understanding of how multiple pathologies co-evolve, JPM could facilitate more targeted, personalized therapeutic interventions and biomarker development, ultimately improving patient management and outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential implicit limitations may include the reliance on accurately defined single-disease 'partial rankings' as input, the computational demands for highly complex mixed pathologies involving many diseases, and that the 'consistency with prior literature' finding, while validating, might imply limited discovery of entirely novel progression patterns for AD/VaD.</p>

However, logical next steps would include applying JPM to a broader spectrum of mixed pathologies, integrating diverse data types (e.g., genetic, imaging, fluid biomarkers) directly into the framework, and developing more robust methods for inferring the initial 'partial rankings' from varied and potentially noisy clinical datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Event-based models (EBMs) infer disease progression from cross-sectional data, and standard EBMs assume a single underlying disease per individual. In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.</p>
