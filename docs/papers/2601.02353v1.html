                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the dual challenge of deploying accurate deep learning models for plant disease detection on low-cost edge devices and learning from scarce labeled data in remote agricultural areas. It proposes a Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline, integrating Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), to combine neural network pruning with few-shot learning. This approach achieves a 78% model size reduction while retaining 92.3% of the original accuracy, enabling real-time field diagnosis at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Farmers in remote areas need quick and reliable methods for identifying plant diseases, yet they often lack access to laboratories or high-performance computing resources. Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\% while maintaining 92.3\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers.</p>
