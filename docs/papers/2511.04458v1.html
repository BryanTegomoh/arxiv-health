                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TRAECR, a novel preprocessing and visualization tool designed to prepare Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging data for statistical analysis. TRAECR aims to facilitate the development of advanced statistical models by providing statisticians with essential tools for data harmonization and registration, addressing critical research questions in diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>TRAECR significantly enhances the ability to conduct rigorous statistical analysis on PET imaging data, which is fundamental for improving diagnostics, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating the efficacy of new treatments for critical medical conditions like Alzheimer's disease and various cancers.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While TRAECR itself is a preprocessing and visualization tool rather than an AI model, its function is critical for 'statistical modeling of PET imaging,' which is foundational for developing and training medical AI/machine learning applications. Many AI models used for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction in fields like oncology and neurology (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) rely on accurately preprocessed and harmonized imaging data like that prepared by TRAECR. Thus, this tool enables and supports the development and application of AI in health and medicine by providing high-quality input data for advanced analytical models, including those driven by AI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used in a number of
clinical applications, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis,
monitoring of disease development, and treatment effect evaluation. Statistical
modeling of PET imaging is essential to address continually emerging scientific
questions in these research fields, including hypotheses related to evaluation
of effects of disease modifying treatments on amyloid reduction in AD and
associations between amyloid reduction and cognitive function, among many
others. In this paper, we provide background information and tools for
statisticians interested in developing statistical models for PET imaging to
pre-process and prepare data for analysis. We introduce our novel
pre-processing and visualization tool TRAECR (Template registration, MRI-PET
co-Registration, Anatomical brain Extraction and COMBAT/RAVEL harmonization) to
facilitate data preparation for statistical analysis.</p>
