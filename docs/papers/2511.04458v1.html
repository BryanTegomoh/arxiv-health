                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used in a number of
clinical applications, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis,
monitoring of disease development, and treatment effect evaluation. Statistical
modeling of PET imaging is essential to address continually emerging scientific
questions in these research fields, including hypotheses related to evaluation
of effects of disease modifying treatments on amyloid reduction in AD and
associations between amyloid reduction and cognitive function, among many
others. In this paper, we provide background information and tools for
statisticians interested in developing statistical models for PET imaging to
pre-process and prepare data for analysis. We introduce our novel
pre-processing and visualization tool TRAECR (Template registration, MRI-PET
co-Registration, Anatomical brain Extraction and COMBAT/RAVEL harmonization) to
facilitate data preparation for statistical analysis.</p>
