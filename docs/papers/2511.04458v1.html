                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TRAECR, a novel preprocessing and visualization tool designed to prepare Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging data for rigorous statistical modeling. It addresses the critical challenge statisticians face in robustly preparing PET data, which is essential for advancing research in clinical fields like Alzheimer's disease and cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This tool is highly medically relevant as it provides a standardized and robust method for preprocessing complex PET imaging data. This ensures that subsequent statistical analyses aimed at understanding disease mechanisms, evaluating treatment efficacy (e.g., in AD or cancer), and developing diagnostic biomarkers are built on reliable, harmonized data, leading to more accurate and translatable medical insights.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The tool TRAECR is a preprocessing and visualization tool for PET imaging data. While it facilitates the preparation of data for 'statistical modeling' and scientific inquiry, it is not an AI application itself. However, cleaned and harmonized PET imaging data, prepared using tools like TRAECR, is crucial foundational input for developing and training medical AI models (e.g., machine learning algorithms for diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response prediction) that analyze medical images.</p>

                    <p>TRAECR is a computational tool that integrates multiple sequential preprocessing steps for PET imaging data. These steps include: 1) **Template registration** for spatial normalization to a standard anatomical space, 2) **MRI-PET co-Registration** to accurately align PET scans with corresponding structural MRI data, 3) **Anatomical brain Extraction** to isolate brain tissue from non-brain structures, and 4) **COMBAT/RAVEL harmonization** for correcting potential batch effects or site-specific variability in multi-center PET studies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used in a number of
clinical applications, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis,
monitoring of disease development, and treatment effect evaluation. Statistical
modeling of PET imaging is essential to address continually emerging scientific
questions in these research fields, including hypotheses related to evaluation
of effects of disease modifying treatments on amyloid reduction in AD and
associations between amyloid reduction and cognitive function, among many
others. In this paper, we provide background information and tools for
statisticians interested in developing statistical models for PET imaging to
pre-process and prepare data for analysis. We introduce our novel
pre-processing and visualization tool TRAECR (Template registration, MRI-PET
co-Registration, Anatomical brain Extraction and COMBAT/RAVEL harmonization) to
facilitate data preparation for statistical analysis.</p>
