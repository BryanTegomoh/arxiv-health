                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper challenges the assumption that combining modalities universally improves Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) performance in computational pathology. It hypothesizes that multimodal gains depend on the individual predictive quality of modalities, with weak ones potentially introducing noise. Using prostate cancer data to predict biochemical recurrence, the study found that fusing high-performing modalities yields superior results, while integrating a poor-performing modality degrades predictive accuracy, advocating for selective, performance-guided fusion.</p>

                    <p>The study employed Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer. It integrated three distinct data modalities: histopathology images, radiology images, and structured clinical data.

                    <p>The central finding is that multimodal gains are not guaranteed; combining high-performing modalities yields superior predictive accuracy over unimodal models. However, the integration of a low-performing modality with otherwise strong modalities actively degrades the overall predictive accuracy. This demonstrates that judicious, performance-guided selection of modalities is crucial for achieving benefits in multimodal deep learning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.</p>
