                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the significant research gap concerning neurodivergent women in Software Engineering (SE), who face unique challenges stemming from the intersection of gender bias and neurological differences. It proposes a novel hybrid methodological approach, integrating InclusiveMag and GenderMag frameworks, to systematically analyze these issues. The initial phase presents a targeted literature review, synthesizing challenges into cognitive, social, organizational, structural, and career progression categories, underscoring how under/late diagnosis and masking intensify exclusion.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for understanding the mental health burden (stress, burnout) and occupational health risks faced by neurodivergent women due to systemic workplace factors. It highlights the profound impact of underdiagnosis and masking on well-being, necessitating greater awareness and tailored support from medical and mental health professionals.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not describe a specific AI application to health. While 'cs.AI' is listed as a category, the proposed methodology focuses on integrating inclusivity frameworks and developing inclusive analytic methods to understand challenges.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The targeted literature review synthesized challenges faced by neurodivergent women in SE into five main categories: cognitive, social, organizational, structural, and career progression difficulties. A critical finding is how under/late diagnosis and the practice of masking neurodivergent traits intensely exacerbate exclusion and the overall negative experiences in the workplace.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research can inform clinical practice by sensitizing psychiatrists, psychologists, and general practitioners to the unique stressors and mental health challenges (e.g., burnout, anxiety, depression) experienced by neurodivergent women in demanding fields like SE. It underscores the importance of early and accurate diagnosis, and the need for occupational health interventions that address workplace biases and support neuroinclusive environments, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and reduced attrition from the workforce.</p>

                <p>The abstract points to a significant limitation in prior research, stating 'no prior work in SE research has systematically examined this group.' Within the scope of this paper, the presented work is primarily the *design* of a methodology and an *initial literature review*, meaning the full application and evaluation of the proposed hybrid method (persona derivation, workshop application) are future steps, not yet completed or reported in this abstract.</p>

                <p>The paper explicitly states that the findings from the literature review 'lay the groundwork for subsequent stages that will develop and apply inclusive analytic methods to support actionable change.' This indicates future work will focus on the practical implementation of the proposed methodology, including deriving personas and conducting collaborative workshops to apply the method and drive real-world improvements.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Neurodivergent women in Software Engineering (SE) encounter distinctive challenges at the intersection of gender bias and neurological differences. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work in SE research has systematically examined this group, despite increasing recognition of neurodiversity in the workplace. Underdiagnosis, masking, and male-centric workplace cultures continue to exacerbate barriers that contribute to stress, burnout, and attrition. In response, we propose a hybrid methodological approach that integrates InclusiveMag's inclusivity framework with the GenderMag walkthrough process, tailored to the context of neurodivergent women in SE. The overarching design unfolds across three stages, scoping through literature review, deriving personas and analytic processes, and applying the method in collaborative workshops. We present a targeted literature review that synthesize challenges into cognitive, social, organizational, structural and career progression challenges neurodivergent women face in SE, including how under/late diagnosis and masking intensify exclusion. These findings lay the groundwork for subsequent stages that will develop and apply inclusive analytic methods to support actionable change.</p>
