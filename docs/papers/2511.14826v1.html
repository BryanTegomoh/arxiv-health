                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study demonstrates the underexplored epidemiological potential of NCBI genomic metadata by analyzing over 477,000 Enterobacterales records. It shows how NCBI data, compared to CDC NORS, offers broader host species insights, greater isolate diversity, and finer spatial-temporal resolution for infectious disease surveillance. These insights are facilitated by a newly developed open-source Python tool, EpiNCBI_V1, highlighting the value of integrating genomic repositories into public health analytics.</p>

                    <p>NCBI genomic metadata can be systematically leveraged to extract meaningful infectious disease patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions. While consistent seasonal peaks and foodborne sources for E. coli and Salmonella were observed in both NCBI and CDC NORS data, NCBI provided richer insights, revealing a broader range of host species (including wildlife and environmental reservoirs) and greater isolate diversity. Additionally, NCBI data offered finer spatial-temporal resolution for tracking pathogen dissemination, and the EpiNCBI_V1 tool enables efficient data acquisition and preparation from NCBI for epidemiological analysis.</p>

                <p>The ability to integrate genomic repositories like NCBI into public health analytics can significantly enhance infectious disease surveillance, enabling earlier and more precise outbreak detection and response. This improves the capacity to track pathogen transmission across different hosts and environments, providing critical data for targeted interventions, risk assessment, and developing more effective public health strategies to control emerging threats and zoonotic diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Numerous studies have utilized NCBI data for genomic analysis, gene annotation, and identifying disease-associated variants, yet NCBI's epidemiological potential remains underexplored. This study demonstrates how NCBI datasets can be systematically leveraged to extract and interpret infectious disease patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions. Using Enterobacterales as a case study, we analyzed over 477,000 genomic records and metadata, including collection date, location, host species, and isolation source. We compared trends of Escherichia coli and Salmonella in NCBI data with CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). While both datasets showed consistent seasonal peaks and foodborne sources, NCBI data revealed broader host species (e.g., wildlife, environmental reservoirs), greater isolate diversity, and finer spatial-temporal resolution. These insights were enabled by our open-source Python package, EpiNCBI_V1, developed for real-time downloading, filtering, and cleaning of pathogen genomic metadata from NCBI. This work highlights the value of integrating genomic repositories into public health analytics to enhance surveillance, outbreak detection, and cross-species transmission tracking globally.</p>
