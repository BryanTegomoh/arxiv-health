                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">SP-Det is a novel self-prompted framework for multi-label lesion detection in chest X-rays that overcomes the limitation of labor-intensive expert annotations by automatically generating rich textual context. It achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy by fusing global semantic context prompts with disease-specific beacon prompts and enhancing features bidirectionally. This approach significantly improves diagnostic capabilities while eliminating the dependency on manual expert input, making automated lesion detection more practical for clinical use.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The SP-Det framework employs an expert-free Dual-Text Prompt Generator (DTPG) to automatically create two types of textual prompts: semantic context prompts for global patterns and disease beacon prompts for specific manifestations.

The framework was evaluated experimentally on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated lesion detection in chest X-rays has demonstrated significant potential for improving clinical diagnosis by precisely localizing pathological abnormalities. While recent promptable detection frameworks have achieved remarkable accuracy in target localization, existing methods typically rely on manual annotations as prompts, which are labor-intensive and impractical for clinical applications. To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures.</p>
