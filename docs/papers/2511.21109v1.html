                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an interpretable and fair clustering framework that embeds fairness constraints directly into decision tree structures, addressing the critical lack of transparency in existing fair clustering methods. The proposed approach not only achieves competitive clustering performance and improved fairness but also offers inherent interpretability and robust handling of multiple sensitive attributes, enabling more equitable and transparent data analysis. A practical variant is also presented, eliminating the need for fairness hyperparameter tuning through a post-pruning strategy.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is highly relevant to medicine and health by providing a transparent and fair approach to patient stratification, resource allocation, and clinical decision support. It can help mitigate algorithmic biases often present in healthcare data, ensuring equitable treatment and outcomes across diverse patient populations defined by protected attributes like race, gender, or socioeconomic status.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The proposed interpretable fair clustering framework can be applied to develop AI systems for patient phenotyping, disease subtyping, or risk stratification that are fair and explainable. For example, clustering patients for personalized treatment plans, allocating medical resources (e.g., vaccine distribution, ICU beds), or identifying high-risk populations, while ensuring equitable outcomes and avoiding bias based on sensitive attributes like race, age, or socioeconomic status. The interpretability allows healthcare professionals to understand the basis of these groupings, fostering trust and enabling ethical decision-making.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology involves constructing interpretable decision trees where fairness constraints are directly embedded into the tree's structural development process. This ensures that each node's partitioning decision considers and maintains fairness across predefined protected groups.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.</p>
