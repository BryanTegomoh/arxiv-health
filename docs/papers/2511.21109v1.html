                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an interpretable and fair clustering framework that integrates fairness constraints directly into the structure of decision trees. It addresses the lack of interpretability in existing fair clustering methods, especially crucial for high-stakes applications. The proposed approach constructs decision trees that partition data fairly across protected groups, demonstrating competitive clustering performance, improved fairness, and interpretability, even with multiple sensitive attributes.</p>

                <p>Bias in healthcare data and algorithmic decisions can lead to inequitable patient care, resource allocation, or disease prediction across different demographic groups. An interpretable fair clustering method allows healthcare professionals to understand the rationale behind patient groupings, mitigate bias, and build trust in AI-driven medical tools.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.</p>
