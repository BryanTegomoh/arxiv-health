                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an interpretable and fair clustering framework that embeds fairness constraints directly into the structure of decision trees, addressing the interpretability gap in existing fair clustering methods. The proposed approach constructs decision trees that partition data equitably across protected groups, demonstrating competitive clustering performance, improved fairness, and robust handling of multiple sensitive attributes. A practical variant requiring no fairness hyperparameter tuning is also presented, enhancing the applicability of transparent and equitable clustering in high-stakes scenarios.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This interpretable fair clustering framework could be applied in medical AI to group patients for personalized treatment plans, identify disease subtypes from electronic health records, stratify patient risk for preventative care, or allocate healthcare resources. By ensuring fairness and interpretability, it could help prevent algorithmic bias from exacerbating health disparities across different demographic groups, provide clear rationale for patient groupings to clinicians, and build trust in AI-driven healthcare solutions.

                    <p>The core methodology involves constructing decision trees where fairness constraints are embedded directly into the tree's structure and splitting criteria. This ensures that the resulting data partitions (clusters) provide fair treatment across identified protected groups. A practical extension is also introduced, where fairness is achieved through post-pruning a standard decision tree (initially built without explicit fairness constraints), thereby eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning related to fairness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.</p>
