                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an interpretable and fair clustering framework that integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. It aims to address the lack of interpretability in existing fair clustering methods, especially for high-stakes applications. The framework delivers competitive clustering performance, improved fairness, interpretability, and robust handling of multiple sensitive attributes, enabling more equitable and transparent data partitioning.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Fair and interpretable clustering is vital in medicine to prevent algorithmic bias in patient stratification, resource allocation, and treatment recommendations, particularly when dealing with sensitive demographic attributes. Understanding the basis of medical decisions is essential for trust, ethical practice, and ensuring equitable health outcomes for all patient populations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This interpretable fair clustering framework could be applied to numerous health scenarios. For instance, it could cluster patient data (e.g., electronic health records, genomic data) to identify distinct patient subgroups for personalized treatment plans or risk stratification, ensuring that these groupings are fair across different demographic or social groups (e.g., race, gender, age). The interpretability allows clinicians to understand the rationale behind the identified patient clusters, fostering trust and enabling better clinical validation. It could also be used in public health to identify vulnerable populations for intervention programs, ensuring equitable distribution of resources without unintended bias.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.</p>
