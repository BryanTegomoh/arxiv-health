                <p class="summary-text">This viewpoint paper analyzes the paradox in digital public health monitoring where advanced AI (e.g., LLMs) offers powerful analytical capabilities, yet researchers face dwindling access to social media data due to platform policy changes. It argues for adapting public health surveillance by embracing decentralized social networks and new methodologies, while advocating for policies that ensure privacy-respective access to public data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This paper is highly relevant to medicine and public health as it addresses the critical challenge of maintaining real-time disease surveillance, tracking health-related public sentiment (e.g., vaccine hesitancy), and developing early-warning systems for health threats in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The proposed adaptations are crucial for the continued efficacy of digital epidemiology.</p>

                <p>The paper describes the application of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), for analyzing social media data to conduct digital public health monitoring. This includes tracking disease outbreaks, monitoring public sentiment related to health (e.g., vaccine hesitancy), and serving as an early-warning system for emerging health threats.</p>

                    <li>Digital public health monitoring historically leveraged major social media platforms like Twitter for real-time disease outbreak tracking and public sentiment analysis.</li>
                    
                    <li>Recent shifts, particularly Twitter's withdrawal of free data access, have severely restricted researchers' ability to utilize these once-indispensable data sources.</li>
                    
                    <li>Simultaneously, advancements in artificial intelligence, notably large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capacity for large-scale textual data analysis across diverse languages and contexts.</li>
                    
                    <li>This creates a critical paradox: powerful AI tools for extracting health insights are available, but access to the necessary social media data is diminishing.</li>
                    
                    <li>The paper discusses decentralized social networks such as Mastodon and Bluesky as potential alternative data sources, weighing their openness and ethical alignment against their current smaller scale and potential biases.</li>
                    
                    <li>Digital public health surveillance must adapt by adopting new platforms and methodologies, focusing on detecting broad signals and common diseases that remain discernible despite data limitations.</li>
                    
                    <li>A key implication is the need to advocate for policies that preserve researchers' access to public data in ways that respect individual privacy.</li>

Furthermore, there's a need to develop and validate novel methodologies for extracting meaningful public health signals from potentially smaller or less complete datasets. The paper also calls for sustained advocacy for policies that ensure privacy-respecting access to public social media data for public health research.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Digital public health monitoring has long relied on data from major social media platforms. Twitter was once an indispensable resource for tracking disease outbreaks and public sentiment in real time. Researchers used Twitter to monitor everything from influenza spread to vaccine hesitancy, demonstrating that social media data can serve as an early-warning system for emerging health threats. However, recent shifts in the social media landscape have challenged this data-driven paradigm. Platform policy changes, exemplified by Twitter's withdrawal of free data access, now restrict the very data that fueled a decade of digital public health research. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have dramatically expanded our capacity to analyze large-scale textual data across languages and contexts. This presents a paradox: we possess powerful new AI tools to extract insights from social media, but face dwindling access to the data. In this viewpoint, we examine how digital public health monitoring is navigating these countervailing trends. We discuss the rise of decentralized social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky as alternative data sources, weighing their openness and ethical alignment with research against their smaller scale and potential biases. Ultimately, we argue that digital public health surveillance must adapt by embracing new platforms and methodologies, focusing on common diseases and broad signals that remain detectable, while advocating for policies that preserve researchers' access to public data in privacy-respective ways.</p>
