                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Empathic Prompting is a novel multimodal framework designed to enrich Large Language Model (LLM) conversations by integrating implicit non-verbal emotional context, captured via facial expression recognition, directly into prompts. This unobtrusive system has demonstrated consistent integration of emotional cues into coherent LLM outputs, leading to improved conversational fluidity and alignment.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is highly relevant to healthcare as it enables AI-driven communication systems (chatbots) to perceive and respond to critical, often unstated, emotional signals from patients. This capability can significantly improve the quality, empathy, and effectiveness of patient interactions, particularly in sensitive medical contexts where emotional states are paramount.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research could lead to AI-powered virtual health assistants or mental health chatbots that are more attuned to a user's emotional state. By continuously analyzing facial expressions for cues like anxiety, distress, or confusion, the AI could adapt its responses, tone, and information delivery to be more empathetic, supportive, or clear, improving patient engagement and outcomes in remote care or automated support systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.</p>
