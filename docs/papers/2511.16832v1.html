                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper analyzes 18.7 million English-language X (formerly Twitter) posts from 2013-2022 to understand the evolving vaccine discourse from pre- to post-COVID-19 periods. It reveals complex shifts in user sentiment and language, showing an initial decrease in negative emotion words and a rise in trust and warmth-related language early in the pandemic. However, this was followed by a significant increase in negative sentiment towards the end of the studied period, indicating growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding the shifting landscape of vaccine discourse on social media is critical for public health authorities and healthcare providers to identify emerging trends in vaccine hesitancy, anticipate and address misinformation, and develop more effective, targeted communication strategies to promote vaccine confidence and uptake.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper utilizes AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques to extract insights from social media data relevant to public health. The findings can inform the development of AI tools for real-time monitoring of vaccine sentiment, identifying misinformation, predicting vaccine hesitancy trends, and personalizing public health messages to improve vaccine uptake and address health disparities. It serves as foundational research for AI applications in public health surveillance and infodemiology.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved creating a novel dataset of 18.7 million English-language vaccine-related posts on X (Twitter) by rigorously preprocessing and filtering 129 million initial posts from 2013 to 2022. Using theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model, the authors performed an analysis of sentiment and emotion word usage over this decade to identify shifts in vaccine discourse across pre- and post-COVID-19 periods. This likely involved natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize and quantify emotional and thematic language.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered vaccine discourse on X. Initially, negative emotion word usage decreased, while 'surprise' and 'trust' related emotion words increased. Early pandemic language also showed a greater use of warmth-focused words (implying trustworthiness) and positive, competence-focused words. However, this trend reversed towards the end of the pandemic period (up to 2022), with a marked rise in negative word usage, indicating a potential increase in vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.</p>

                <p>Insights from this research can guide public health campaigns by providing timely data on public sentiment and specific concerns regarding vaccines. Clinicians can benefit from understanding evolving public perceptions to better address patient questions, manage expectations, and counter misinformation, thereby improving patient counseling and encouraging vaccine acceptance. This understanding facilitates the development of proactive and adaptive health communication strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this work, we study English-language vaccine discourse in social media posts, specifically posts on X (formerly Twitter), in seven years before the COVID-19 outbreak (2013 to 2019) and three years after the outbreak was first reported (2020 to 2022). Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.</p>
