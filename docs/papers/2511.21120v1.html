                    <p>CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations) is a deep learning framework designed to integrate diverse biological data. It jointly models multi-modal inputs, specifically chemical structures and cellular responses (e.g., morphology, gene expression), to capture local-global dependencies. A core component is a novel tree-structured vector quantization module, which is employed to explicitly capture and represent latent biological hierarchies spanning molecular, cellular, and genomic levels, thereby providing structured, context-rich representations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.
