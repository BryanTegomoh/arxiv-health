                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning strategy for denoising low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images, addressing the challenge of acquiring paired normal-dose CT (NDCT) data. The method employs a progressive, step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism and Gaussian noise regularization to achieve fine-grained denoising. Evaluated on the Mayo LDCT dataset, the proposed technique significantly outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and demonstrates performance comparable to, or better than, several supervised denoising methods.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reducing radiation dose in CT scans is crucial for patient safety, especially for vulnerable populations or those requiring repeated scans. This method enables high-quality LDCT imaging without compromising diagnostic accuracy, which is vital for preventing misdiagnosis due to noise-induced artifacts.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research applies self-supervised learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), to improve the quality of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images. By denoising LDCT images effectively without requiring paired normal-dose CT data (which is difficult to acquire in clinical practice), the AI method enhances the diagnostic utility of CT scans, potentially leading to more accurate diagnoses, reduced radiation exposure for patients, and more efficient clinical workflows in radiology departments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Self-supervised learning is increasingly investigated for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) image denoising, as it alleviates the dependence on paired normal-dose CT (NDCT) data, which are often difficult to acquire in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised training strategy that relies exclusively on LDCT images. We introduce a step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism that enforces conditional independence in a progressive manner, enabling more fine-grained denoising learning. In addition, we add Gaussian noise to LDCT images, which acts as a regularization and mitigates overfitting. Extensive experiments on the Mayo LDCT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to, or better than, several representative supervised denoising methods.</p>
