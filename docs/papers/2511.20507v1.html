                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a novel text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB), designed to assess aphasia-like deficits in Large Language Models (LLMs). The TAB comprises four subtests, and the authors validated an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating reliability comparable to expert human raters. This work provides a scalable, clinically-grounded framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

                <p>The primary AI health application described is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a computational 'model organism' to study and understand the underlying mechanisms and computational basis of human linguistic disorders, such as aphasia. This foundational research aims to leverage AI to gain insights into human medical conditions, potentially informing future diagnostic methods, therapeutic strategies, or assistive technologies for individuals with aphasia.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>While not directly diagnostic for human patients, this work provides a foundational computational tool to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of language breakdown in a controlled, artificial environment. This could indirectly inform our understanding of human aphasia, potentially leading to new hypotheses about cognitive architectures of language and novel approaches to diagnosis, rehabilitation, or the development of AI-assisted therapeutic tools for speech-language pathology. It also establishes a standard for evaluating the linguistic robustness and vulnerabilities of AI models intended for healthcare applications.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The benchmark assesses 'aphasia-like deficits' in artificial systems, not actual human aphasia, which limits direct clinical extrapolation. The reported Cohen's kappa values, while comparable between model and human, are relatively low (0.255 and 0.286), suggesting fair to moderate agreement and potential for refinement in scoring granularity. The reliance on a specific LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for validation means generalizability to all LLMs or future models might vary.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research can utilize the TAB to systematically analyze and compare various LLM architectures to identify specific patterns and types of aphasia-like deficits. Further refinement of the automated evaluation protocol could enhance its reliability and capture more nuanced linguistic errors. Investigating correlations between deficits observed in LLMs via TAB and specific linguistic or cognitive theories of human aphasia could yield deeper insights into the computational basis of language disorders.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.</p>
