                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a novel text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery, designed to assess aphasia-like deficits in large language models (LLMs). It details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring, alongside validating an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash that shows reliability comparable to expert human raters. The TAB thus provides a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for computationally studying linguistic disorders.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors designed the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB) by adapting the clinically established Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) into a text-only format suitable for LLMs. This involved defining four specific subtests (Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, Repetition) and their corresponding scoring criteria. An automated evaluation protocol, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Flash, was then developed to score LLM outputs. The reliability of this automated protocol was validated by comparing its agreement with expert human raters against human-human agreement, using prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa statistics.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the successful validation of an automated evaluation protocol for the TAB using Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating reliability comparable to expert human raters. Specifically, the prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa for model-consensus agreement was 0.255, closely aligning with the human-human agreement kappa of 0.286, suggesting the protocol is suitable for large-scale, automated analysis of aphasia-like deficits in LLMs.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>While not a direct clinical tool for patients, the TAB offers a standardized, scalable, and objective framework for researchers to computationally model and study the characteristics of aphasia. This can deepen our theoretical understanding of language impairment, potentially generating new hypotheses about the cognitive and linguistic underpinnings of aphasia that could guide future clinical research into diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state any limitations. However, it implicitly acknowledges that LLM deficits are "aphasia-like" rather than true aphasia, highlighting the distinction between artificial systems and human neurological conditions. The Cohen's kappa values, while comparable, indicate only fair agreement, suggesting room for refinement in evaluation precision.</p>

                <p>The release of TAB as a "scalable framework" implicitly encourages its widespread use for analyzing various LLMs, exploring different types and severities of language deficits, and potentially comparing computational findings with clinical observations of human aphasia to advance understanding of this complex disorder.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.</p>
