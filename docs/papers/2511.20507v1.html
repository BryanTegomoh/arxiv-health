                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a novel text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) designed to assess aphasia-like deficits in large language models (LLMs). It details the TAB's design, subtests (Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition), and scoring criteria. The authors validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating its reliability is comparable to expert human raters, providing a scalable and clinically-grounded framework for studying language deficits in artificial systems.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a foundational tool for using large language models as computational 'model organisms' to investigate the underlying mechanisms of linguistic disorders such as aphasia. By creating a standardized, clinically-grounded benchmark, it opens new avenues for understanding, simulating, and potentially developing AI-driven insights into diagnosis and rehabilitation strategies for aphasia.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application here is foundational: using LLMs as computational models to study human linguistic disorders like aphasia. This research aims to understand the computational basis of these conditions, which can inform: 
1.  **Basic understanding of disease mechanisms**: Gaining insights into how aphasia manifests computationally could lead to new theories about its neurological underpinnings.
2.  **Development of future diagnostic/therapeutic AI**: A deeper computational understanding of aphasia could pave the way for more sophisticated AI tools for early detection, differential diagnosis, personalized rehabilitation strategies, or even AI assistants capable of understanding and interacting more effectively with individuals with aphasia.
3.  **Evaluating AI for medical contexts**: The developed Text Aphasia Battery (TAB) could serve as a benchmark for evaluating the 'health' or robustness of AI systems themselves when applied to language-related medical tasks, ensuring they do not exhibit 'aphasia-like deficits' that could compromise their utility or safety in healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.</p>
