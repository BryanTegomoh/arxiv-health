                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB), designed to assess aphasia-like deficits in large language models (LLMs). The TAB comprises four subtests, providing a novel computational tool to study linguistic disorders. A key finding is the validation of an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper applies AI (Large Language Models) as 'model organisms' to computationally study aphasia, a human linguistic disorder.

                    <p>The study involved adapting a clinical aphasia assessment (QAB) into a text-only benchmark (TAB) suitable for LLMs, comprising four specific subtests and scoring criteria.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the successful development and validation of the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a clinically-grounded, text-only benchmark for assessing aphasia-like deficits in LLMs. Crucially, an automated evaluation protocol based on Gemini 2.5 Flash was shown to achieve reliability (kappa = 0.255) comparable to that of expert human raters (kappa = 0.286), making the TAB scalable for widespread use.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>While TAB directly assesses LLMs, its insights could deepen the understanding of the computational underpinnings of linguistic deficits seen in human aphasia, potentially guiding research into more effective diagnostic tools or rehabilitation strategies. It also provides a standardized way to evaluate the robustness of AI language systems against simulated language impairments, which is critical for their safe and effective deployment in healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, inferable limitations include that the benchmark assesses "aphasia-like" deficits in LLMs, which are not biological systems, meaning it models linguistic symptoms rather than the underlying neurobiological pathology of human aphasia. Additionally, the reported Cohen's kappa values (0.255-0.286), while comparable between automated and human raters, generally indicate only "slight" to "fair" agreement, suggesting inherent challenges in robustly assessing these language deficits or room for improved rater consistency.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly detailed beyond releasing the benchmark, the paper implies future research will utilize the TAB as a scalable framework for analyzing language deficits across various artificial systems. This could involve probing different LLM architectures, training paradigms, or exploring specific types of aphasia-like impairments in detail.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.</p>
