                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel approach called "cooperative public AI red-teaming exercises" to address the critical "responsibility gap" in evaluating AI systems, especially those deployed in high-stakes sectors like healthcare. It argues that current adversarial evaluation methods are insufficient for sophisticated AI and presents early positive results from pilot implementations (CAMLIS 2024, NIST ARIA, Singapore IMDA), demonstrating the model's effectiveness and scalability in rigorously assessing AI risks and vulnerabilities.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper's methodology centers on proposing and reviewing the operational design and early results of a "cooperative public AI red-teaming exercise" model. This involves conducting pilot implementations where public participants are engaged in adversarial evaluation of AI systems. Specific exercises reviewed include the in-person public demonstrator at CAMLIS 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s ARIA pilot, and a similar exercise with the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). The goal is to assess the approach's capability to identify AI risks and its scalability.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that the proposed cooperative public AI red-teaming model is a promising and effective approach for identifying a broader and deeper range of AI risks and vulnerabilities that current evaluation methods often miss. Early results from the pilot implementations suggest that involving diverse public participants in adversarial testing can successfully contribute to closing the "responsibility gap," making AI systems more secure, fair, and trustworthy, and that this model is both effective and scalable.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact of this model is significant. By systematically stress-testing AI algorithms used in diagnostics (e.g., image analysis), treatment recommendations, or risk prediction, it can proactively uncover biases against specific demographic groups, vulnerabilities to generating harmful medical misinformation, or security flaws that could compromise patient data or care. This leads to the development and deployment of more robust, equitable, and safer AI tools, ultimately enhancing patient safety, improving diagnostic accuracy, and fostering greater trust in AI-powered healthcare solutions.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the abstract highlights the limitations of *current* evaluation methods, it implies that the proposed public red-teaming model is in its early stages of validation, referring to "early results of its prior pilot implementations." This suggests that comprehensive, long-term efficacy, detailed operational challenges, or full-scale implementation complexities might not yet be fully understood or presented. The scalability argument is made, but its real-world challenges across diverse jurisdictions are likely still under exploration.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The paper explicitly argues for the scalability of this public red-teaming approach to "many AI developing jurisdictions," indicating a future direction focused on broader implementation and adoption. This implies continued refinement of the operational design, integration into national or international AI governance frameworks, and further research into maximizing public participation and the effectiveness of adversarial evaluations across diverse cultural and technological contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without
rigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess
the breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of
systems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation
and red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and
other documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI
systems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare,
and intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are
proving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.
  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are
fully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new
approaches to close this "responsibility gap" are now more urgent than ever. In
this paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming
exercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This
approach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public
demonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the
operational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI
(ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the
Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue
that this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also
scalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.</p>
