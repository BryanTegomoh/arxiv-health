                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">AdaGReS introduces a novel redundancy-aware framework for token-budgeted Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) that optimizes context selection by balancing query-chunk relevance with intra-set redundancy penalties. It employs greedy selection with an adaptively calibrated trade-off parameter, providing theoretical guarantees and significantly improving context quality, answer accuracy, and robustness, particularly for high-redundancy biomedical information.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>AdaGReS can be applied to enhance medical AI applications that rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Specifically, it can improve the quality and efficiency of retrieving and synthesizing information from large biomedical datasets, drug databases, or electronic health records.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>AdaGReS employs a set-level objective function designed to maximize query-chunk relevance while penalizing intra-set redundancy. Context chunks are greedily selected under a token-budget constraint based on their marginal gains from this objective. A unique aspect is the instance-adaptive, closed-form calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter, eliminating the need for manual tuning. The methodology also includes a theoretical analysis proving the epsilon-approximate submodularity of the objective, thus guaranteeing near-optimality for the greedy selection.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.</p>
