                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">AdaGReS is a novel framework for token-budgeted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses the issue of redundant context selection by optimizing a set-level objective combining query relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. It employs greedy selection with an adaptively calibrated trade-off parameter, theoretically guaranteeing near-optimal context selection, which translates to improved answer quality and robustness across various domains, including biomedical. This framework significantly enhances the efficiency and reliability of RAG by ensuring high-quality, non-redundant contextual information.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>AdaGReS operates by performing a greedy selection of context chunks under a token budget. This selection is guided by a novel set-level objective function that simultaneously considers the relevance of each candidate chunk to the query and penalizes redundancy within the already selected context set. A key methodological contribution is a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration method for the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter, which automatically adjusts based on the statistical properties of the candidate pool and the token budget, removing the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. The method's effectiveness is further supported by a theoretical analysis demonstrating epsilon-approximate submodularity of its objective, ensuring near-optimal performance of the greedy selection.</p>

                    <p>The primary findings indicate that AdaGReS significantly outperforms baseline methods in controlling redundancy within the retrieved context, leading to a substantial improvement in the overall quality of the selected context. This enhanced context quality directly translates to superior end-to-end answer quality and increased robustness of the RAG system. These improvements were consistently observed across diverse datasets, including a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus, underscoring its broad applicability and effectiveness in specialized domains.</p>

                <p>AdaGReS has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice and medical research by making RAG systems more reliable and efficient. By ensuring that medical professionals receive precise, non-redundant, and high-quality information for queries related to diagnoses, treatment plans, drug interactions, or patient management, it can enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic decisions, and improve patient safety. The reduction in redundant information also saves valuable computational resources, making advanced RAG applications more practical for real-time clinical use and accelerating drug discovery and biomedical research by providing cleaner, more focused contextual data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.</p>
