                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">AdaGReS is a novel framework for token-budgeted Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that addresses the issue of redundant context by optimizing a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. It employs greedy selection with an adaptively calibrated trade-off parameter, theoretically guaranteeing near-optimality for context selection. Experimental results, particularly on a high-redundancy biomedical corpus, demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control, context quality, and end-to-end answer generation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is highly relevant to medicine and health by ensuring that RAG systems used for medical information retrieval provide concise, non-redundant, and high-quality contextual information within strict token limits. Its proven effectiveness on a "high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus" directly demonstrates its utility in high-stakes medical domains where precise and efficient information access is critical.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>AdaGReS can be applied to improve RAG systems designed to synthesize information from vast medical and biomedical texts (e.g., scientific papers, drug interaction databases, electronic health records). This can lead to more accurate answers for clinical queries, assist in drug development by reducing redundancy in research data summaries, and enhance knowledge retrieval for medical professionals and researchers, thereby supporting diagnostics, treatment planning, and medical education.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>AdaGReS employs a greedy selection strategy to choose context chunks under a token-budget constraint. It optimizes a novel set-level objective function that incorporates both query-chunk relevance and a penalty for redundancy within the selected set. A key methodological innovation is the instance-adaptive, closed-form calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter, eliminating the need for manual tuning. The approach is theoretically grounded by demonstrating epsilon-approximate submodularity of the objective, ensuring near-optimal performance of the greedy selection.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>AdaGReS could significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of RAG systems in clinical settings by ensuring that healthcare professionals receive the most pertinent and non-repetitive information for complex queries. This is crucial for applications like drug interaction checks, treatment guideline lookups, or patient record summarization, where token budgets are often limited and redundant information can hinder rapid, accurate decision-making or even lead to errors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.</p>
