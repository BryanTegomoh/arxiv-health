                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates how perception biases in social contact surveys, specifically concerning the estimation of others' age and race, impact the accuracy of derived contact patterns and subsequent infectious disease model projections. The study found that such biases significantly reduce the accuracy of contact patterns, leading to a systematic underestimation of cumulative disease incidence in older individuals (65+) and racial minority populations when these biased patterns are used in transmission models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of infectious disease modeling and improving public health preparedness. Misleading model projections due to survey biases can result in ineffective interventions and misallocation of resources, potentially exacerbating health disparities in vulnerable populations.</p>

                <p>Not applicable; the paper uses simulation and a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental model, which are computational methods but do not constitute an AI application as described within the paper itself. While AI could potentially be used to address the biases identified or for more advanced disease modeling, this paper does not describe such an application.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Social contact patterns are a key input to many infectious disease models.
Contact surveys, where participants are asked to provide information on their
recent close and casual contacts with others, are one of the standard methods
to measure contact patterns in a population. Surveys that require detailed
sociodemographic descriptions of contacts allow for the specification of
fine-grained contact rates between subpopulations in models. However,
perception biases affecting a surveyed person's ability to estimate
sociodemographic attributes (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) of others
could affect contact rates derived from survey data. Here, we simulate contact
surveys using a synthetic contact network of New Mexico to investigate the
impact of these biases on survey accuracy and infectious disease model
projections. We found that perception biases affecting the estimation of
another individual's age and race substantially decreased the accuracy of the
derived contact patterns. Using these biased patterns in a
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model lead to an underestimation
of cumulative incidence among older people (65+ years) and individuals
identifying as races other than White. Our study shows that perception biases
can impact contact patterns estimated from surveys in ways that systematically
underestimate disease burden in minority populations when used in transmission
models.</p>
