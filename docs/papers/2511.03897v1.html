                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study simulates social contact surveys on a synthetic network to investigate how perception biases in estimating others' sociodemographic attributes (age, race) impact derived contact patterns and infectious disease model projections. It found that such biases significantly reduce survey accuracy, leading to a systematic underestimation of cumulative disease incidence in older populations and racial minority groups when used in Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models.</p>

                    <p>The study used a simulation approach, creating a synthetic contact network for New Mexico to mimic real-world interactions.

                <p>The findings highlight a critical challenge for public health interventions: disease models relying on contact survey data may systematically underestimate disease burden in specific vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, racial minorities). This could lead to inequitable resource allocation, delayed or insufficient interventions for these groups, and ultimately exacerbate health disparities. Accurate contact pattern data is vital for effective vaccine distribution, targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions, and equitable pandemic preparedness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Social contact patterns are a key input to many infectious disease models.
Contact surveys, where participants are asked to provide information on their
recent close and casual contacts with others, are one of the standard methods
to measure contact patterns in a population. Surveys that require detailed
sociodemographic descriptions of contacts allow for the specification of
fine-grained contact rates between subpopulations in models. However,
perception biases affecting a surveyed person's ability to estimate
sociodemographic attributes (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) of others
could affect contact rates derived from survey data. Here, we simulate contact
surveys using a synthetic contact network of New Mexico to investigate the
impact of these biases on survey accuracy and infectious disease model
projections. We found that perception biases affecting the estimation of
another individual's age and race substantially decreased the accuracy of the
derived contact patterns. Using these biased patterns in a
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model lead to an underestimation
of cumulative incidence among older people (65+ years) and individuals
identifying as races other than White. Our study shows that perception biases
can impact contact patterns estimated from surveys in ways that systematically
underestimate disease burden in minority populations when used in transmission
models.</p>
