                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study simulates contact surveys to investigate how perception biases, specifically in estimating age and race of contacts, affect the accuracy of derived contact patterns used in infectious disease models. It found that these biases substantially decrease accuracy, leading to a systematic underestimation of cumulative incidence among older people and non-White individuals in Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and equity of infectious disease modeling. Inaccurate contact data due to perception biases can lead to misinformed public health policies and an underestimation of disease burden in vulnerable populations, thus hindering effective interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper uses computational simulation and an SIR compartmental model, which are established tools in epidemiology. While this involves computational methods, it does not describe the application of advanced AI techniques (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing for medical data analysis) to health problems. Therefore, it does not directly fit the description of a medical AI application.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a simulation-based approach. It constructed a synthetic contact network for New Mexico and then simulated contact surveys within this network. During these simulated surveys, perception biases were introduced when estimating the age and race of contacts.

                    <p>1. Perception biases in estimating the age and race of contacts substantially reduce the accuracy of contact patterns derived from surveys. 2. Using these biased contact patterns in an SIR model leads to a significant underestimation of cumulative infectious disease incidence. 3. This underestimation disproportionately affects older individuals (65+ years) and non-White populations. 4. The study demonstrates a systematic underestimation of disease burden in minority populations when survey-derived contact data with perception biases are used in transmission models.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has direct implications for public health practice and clinical epidemiology. It indicates that current infectious disease models relying on contact survey data might systematically underrepresent disease spread and impact in specific demographic groups, particularly older adults and racial minorities. This could lead to misallocation of healthcare resources, insufficient targeting of vaccination campaigns or public health interventions, and an exacerbation of health inequities. It underscores the need for methodological improvements in contact data collection or post-collection data adjustment to correct for perception biases and ensure more equitable and effective disease control strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Social contact patterns are a key input to many infectious disease models.
Contact surveys, where participants are asked to provide information on their
recent close and casual contacts with others, are one of the standard methods
to measure contact patterns in a population. Surveys that require detailed
sociodemographic descriptions of contacts allow for the specification of
fine-grained contact rates between subpopulations in models. However,
perception biases affecting a surveyed person's ability to estimate
sociodemographic attributes (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) of others
could affect contact rates derived from survey data. Here, we simulate contact
surveys using a synthetic contact network of New Mexico to investigate the
impact of these biases on survey accuracy and infectious disease model
projections. We found that perception biases affecting the estimation of
another individual's age and race substantially decreased the accuracy of the
derived contact patterns. Using these biased patterns in a
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model lead to an underestimation
of cumulative incidence among older people (65+ years) and individuals
identifying as races other than White. Our study shows that perception biases
can impact contact patterns estimated from surveys in ways that systematically
underestimate disease burden in minority populations when used in transmission
models.</p>
