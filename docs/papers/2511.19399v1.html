                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Existing deep research models struggle with multi-step, long-form tasks due to training on easily verifiable short-form QA. This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), a novel training methodology where evaluation rubrics dynamically co-evolve with the policy model to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Utilizing RLER, they developed DR Tulu-8B, the first open model for open-ended, long-form deep research, which significantly outperforms other open models and matches proprietary systems across science, healthcare, and general domains.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology is Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER). This approach involves training a policy model (DR Tulu-8B) where the evaluation rubrics are not static but dynamically constructed and maintained, co-evolving with the policy during the training process. This co-evolution allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored, thereby providing discriminative and on-policy feedback. The trained model was evaluated on four long-form deep research benchmarks covering science, healthcare, and general domains.</p>

                    <p>DR Tulu-8B, trained using the RLER method, demonstrated substantial performance improvements over existing open deep research models. It successfully matched or exceeded the capabilities of proprietary deep research systems in generating long-form, well-attributed answers across scientific, healthcare, and general benchmarks. Notably, DR Tulu-8B achieves this while being a significantly smaller (8B parameters) and more cost-effective model per query, indicating high efficiency and generalizability of the RLER approach for complex research tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.</p>
