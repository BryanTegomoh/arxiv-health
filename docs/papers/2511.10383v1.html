                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical challenge of approximation errors in continuous-time offline reinforcement learning, a necessity for high-stakes fields like healthcare where direct interaction is infeasible. It proposes an operator-theoretic algorithm grounded in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, representing the world model using the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. The research establishes global convergence of the value function and provides finite-sample guarantees, highlighting the promise of this operator-based approach for continuous-time optimal control.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on an operator-theoretic framework for continuous-time offline reinforcement learning. It reformulates the problem through the lens of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The core innovation involves representing the underlying stochastic process dynamics (world model) using the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes, which is learned effectively within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This integration of statistical learning and operator theory enables a dynamic programming recursion to derive policies from historical, offline datasets.</p>

                <p>This research holds substantial potential to transform clinical decision-making and patient care.

                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, typical limitations for foundational theoretical work in this area include potential computational complexity for high-dimensional or very large-scale real-world medical datasets, the implicit assumption of sufficient quality and richness of offline historical data, and the practical challenges of translating theoretical convergence guarantees into robust, real-time clinical deployment.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.</p>
