                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents an integrative predictive coding model for interoceptive and exteroceptive integration, where relative precision weights arbitrate between the two streams in the AIC and ACC. Computational simulations replicated stable integration and modeled how dysregulated precision weighting, characteristic of anxiety (interoceptive overweighting) and PTSD (exteroceptive overweighting), creates rigid imbalances and slowed recalibration. Empirical validation with EEG-fMRI data supports the model, which offers a unifying framework for these psychiatric conditions and outlines testable predictions for targeted therapies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper develops an 'integrative predictive coding model' validated through 'computational simulations' and 'empirical application'. This computational model, which identifies mechanisms of mental health disorders (anxiety, PTSD) and proposes therapeutic targets, could serve as a foundational framework for AI-driven applications. These applications might include personalized diagnostics, predictive analytics for treatment response, or real-time adaptive therapeutic interventions (e.g., neurofeedback, vagal stimulation) that adjust based on an individual's interoceptive-exteroceptive balance and precision weighting.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a multi-pronged approach: (1) **Theoretical Model Development**: An integrative predictive coding framework was formulated, positing parallel interoceptive and exteroceptive systems with precision-weighted error exchange and arbitration in the AIC/ACC. (2) **Computational Simulations**: The model was computationally simulated to examine dynamic stability, integration, and dysregulation patterns resembling anxiety and PTSD. (3) **Empirical Validation**: The model's arbitration equation was applied to existing published EEG-fMRI datasets to validate its biological realism. (4) **Proposed Experimental Design**: An outline for future human experiments was developed, involving targeted therapies and assessment of neural and behavioral markers across clinical groups.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>1. The integrative predictive coding model successfully reproduced biologically plausible dynamics, with prediction errors decaying exponentially and arbitration weights self-normalizing towards an equilibrium (w = 0.5), indicating stable, coherent integration. 2. Simulated anxiety (interoceptive overweighting) and PTSD (exteroceptive overweighting/underweighted interoception) conditions resulted in rigid, self-sustaining imbalances in precision weighting (w trending towards 1 or 0) and significantly slowed recalibration. 3. Empirical application of the model's arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets provided further validation, suggesting its relevance to actual brain activity. 4. The framework provides a unifying theoretical account where dysregulated precision weighting (e.g., interoceptive overweighting in anxiety, underweighted interoception in PTSD) serves as a core mechanism underlying these psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by: (1) providing a robust neurocomputational framework to understand the underlying mechanisms of anxiety and PTSD, shifting focus from symptoms to foundational dysregulation of precision weighting. (2) Offering a theoretical basis for developing and evaluating targeted therapies aimed at recalibrating interoceptive and exteroceptive precision, such as neuromodulation (e.g., vagal stimulation) or specific cognitive-behavioral interventions. (3) Providing quantifiable neural (e.g., coherence markers, heartbeat-evoked potentials) and behavioral (e.g., congruency task performance) biomarkers to assess treatment efficacy and predict therapeutic response in these conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.</p>
