                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenge of estimating total treatment effects in randomized experiments conducted within bipartite systems, where only a subset of treatment-side units are eligible for intervention, but all units interact and generate spillovers. The authors formalize this setting, define key estimands (PTTE and STTE), and develop interference-aware ensemble estimators that leverage machine learning and a novel projection method to accurately quantify direct and indirect effects, showing significant improvements over methods that ignore interference.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Many health interventions, such as public health campaigns, vaccine trials, or new treatment rollouts, occur within interconnected populations (e.g., patient-provider networks, social networks) where only certain individuals are eligible for treatment, but the effects can spill over to others. This methodology provides a crucial tool for accurately estimating the true impact of such interventions, leading to better-informed public health policies and clinical guidelines.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The methodology developed, leveraging 'flexible machine learning' and 'ensemble estimators' for robust causal inference, can be applied in medical AI systems. For instance, an AI platform designed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of new treatments or public health policies would benefit from these advanced methods to account for complex interactions (spillovers) between individuals or groups and to handle partial eligibility criteria inherent in many health interventions. This allows for more accurate and unbiased assessment of AI-driven health interventions or data-driven policy recommendations, improving evidence-based decision-making in health.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper formalizes eligibility-constrained bipartite experiments and defines PTTE and STTE. It establishes identification conditions under randomization within the eligible set. The core method involves interference-aware ensemble estimators that combine exposure mappings, generalized propensity scores, and flexible machine learning models. A projection method is introduced to link treatment-level estimands to outcome-level estimands, offering exactness under a 'Linear Additive Edges' condition, which facilitates estimation on the typically smaller treatment side with deterministic aggregation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The proposed estimators demonstrate low bias and variance in recovering PTTE and STTE in simulations, significantly reducing bias that would arise from ignoring interference. In real-world field experiments, the method consistently corrected the direction of expected interference bias and, in one notable instance, altered the sign and statistical significance of the primary decision metric, underscoring its practical utility and impact on decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This methodology can significantly improve the design and evaluation of health interventions in complex, interconnected settings. By accurately accounting for spillovers and partial eligibility, it enables clinicians and public health practitioners to more reliably assess the true total impact of treatments or programs on both directly targeted (eligible) and indirectly affected (ineligible) populations. This leads to more precise impact assessments, optimized resource allocation, and ultimately, more effective health strategies and policies.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The exactness of the projection method for linking treatment- and outcome-level estimands is conditional on a 'Linear Additive Edges' assumption. While the ensemble approach aims for robustness, the general applicability and performance might depend on the specific structure of the bipartite network and the nature of interference, which can be complex to model.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state future research directions. However, implicit future work could involve exploring the robustness of the 'Linear Additive Edges' assumption in various real-world scenarios, extending the methodology to more complex network structures (e.g., non-bipartite or multi-layered networks), or developing methods for optimal experimental design under these interference and eligibility constraints.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We study randomized experiments in bipartite systems where only a subset of treatment-side units are eligible for assignment while all units continue to interact, generating interference. We formalize eligibility-constrained bipartite experiments and define estimands aligned with full deployment: the Primary Total Treatment Effect (PTTE) on eligible units and the Secondary Total Treatment Effect (STTE) on ineligible units. Under randomization within the eligible set, we give identification conditions and develop interference-aware ensemble estimators that combine exposure mappings, generalized propensity scores, and flexible machine learning. We further introduce a projection that links treatment- and outcome-level estimands; this mapping is exact under a Linear Additive Edges condition and enables estimation on the (typically much smaller) treatment side with deterministic aggregation to outcomes. In simulations with known ground truth across realistic exposure regimes, the proposed estimators recover PTTE and STTE with low bias and variance and reduce the bias that could arise when interference is ignored. Two field experiments illustrate practical relevance: our method corrects the direction of expected interference bias for a pre-specified metric in both studies and reverses the sign and significance of the primary decision metric in one case.</p>
