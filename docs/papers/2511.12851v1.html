                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">NeuroLex is a novel, lightweight domain-adaptive language model specifically developed for understanding and generating clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) reports, addressing the limitations of general-purpose LMs in capturing specialized linguistic conventions. Trained purely on EEG report text, it achieves superior performance in EEG-specific tasks such as summarization, information extraction, and robustness to negation compared to general models of the same scale. This model serves as a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding in brain-computer interface applications.</p>

                    <p>NeuroLex significantly outperforms general-purpose language models of the same scale, achieving lower perplexity, higher accuracy in information extraction and summarization tasks, and superior label efficiency. A critical finding is its improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination, which are common challenges in clinical text analysis and essential for reliable medical applications.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>NeuroLex has the potential to streamline clinical workflows by automating or assisting in the understanding and generation of EEG reports, thereby reducing cognitive load on neurologists and improving diagnostic efficiency. Furthermore, its role as a linguistic backbone for multimodal systems could lead to more interpretable brain-computer interfaces that translate complex neural activity directly into clinically meaningful language.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While effective, NeuroLex is described as a 'lightweight' model trained 'purely on EEG report text from the Harvard Electroencephalography Database,' which may imply limitations in its generalizability to diverse EEG reporting styles across different institutions or broader biomedical textual domains beyond EEG. The abstract does not detail its performance within a full multimodal EEG-language system.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) reports encode domain-specific linguistic conventions that general-purpose language models (LMs) fail to capture. We introduce NeuroLex, a lightweight domain-adaptive language model trained purely on EEG report text from the Harvard Electroencephalography Database. Unlike existing biomedical LMs, NeuroLex is tailored to the linguistic and diagnostic characteristics of EEG reporting, enabling it to serve as both an independent textual model and a decoder backbone for multimodal EEG-language systems. Using span-corruption pretraining and instruction-style fine-tuning on report polishing, paragraph summarization, and terminology question answering, NeuroLex learns the syntax and reasoning patterns characteristic of EEG interpretation. Comprehensive evaluations show that it achieves lower perplexity, higher extraction and summarization accuracy, better label efficiency, and improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination compared with general models of the same scale. With an EEG-aware linguistic backbone, NeuroLex bridges biomedical text modeling and brain-computer interface applications, offering a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding.</p>
