                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper surveys the emerging field of dataless training of neural networks for optimization problems, where models are re-parameterized to solve problems without explicit training data. It categorizes these methods into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific approaches, motivated by the limitations of data-driven methods and the inherent scarcity of data in domains like medical imaging. The review highlights the promising results of this approach across various applications.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This approach is highly relevant for medicine as it offers a paradigm to leverage powerful neural networks for critical optimization tasks, especially in areas like medical image reconstruction, where obtaining large, labeled training datasets is often challenging, costly, or ethically constrained. It can enable advanced computational solutions even with limited data availability.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research would enable the application of neural networks for optimization and inverse problems in healthcare, particularly in scenarios where acquiring large, labeled training datasets is challenging or impossible. A key application highlighted is medical image reconstruction (e.g., MRI, CT, PET), allowing for more effective and potentially faster reconstruction algorithms without relying on extensive pre-existing datasets. It could also extend to other areas facing data scarcity, such as drug discovery (optimizing molecular structures with limited experimental data), personalized medicine (optimizing treatment plans based on sparse patient data), or even biosecurity (modeling pathogen spread or developing countermeasures with minimal initial data).</p>

                <p>If further developed and validated, dataless neural networks could profoundly impact clinical practice by enabling more accurate and robust medical image reconstruction from limited or noisy raw data. This could lead to improved diagnostic quality, potentially reducing scan times, radiation exposure, or enabling novel imaging modalities where data collection is sparse. It may also extend to other data-scarce medical applications such as personalized treatment planning, drug discovery, or genomic analysis.</p>

However, the motivation implicitly highlights the limitations of *data-driven* methods in specific optimization tasks and the general challenge of *data scarcity*.

Future directions would likely include the exploration of novel neural network architectures for re-parameterization, expansion to more complex and higher-dimensional optimization problems, rigorous validation of performance against established methods, and broader application and refinement within critical data-scarce domains like advanced medical imaging and scientific discovery.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.</p>
