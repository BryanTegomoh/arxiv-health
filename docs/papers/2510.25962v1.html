                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to leverage neural networks for complex optimization tasks without extensive training data could significantly impact clinical practice. For example, in medical image reconstruction, it may enable faster and more accurate imaging with reduced radiation or fewer artifacts, facilitating earlier and more precise diagnoses. This could also accelerate the development of diagnostic tools for rare diseases or improve personalized treatment planning by addressing data scarcity, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.</p>
