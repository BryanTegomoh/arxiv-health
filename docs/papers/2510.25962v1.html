                <p class="summary-text">This paper provides a comprehensive survey of dataless training methods for neural networks (NNs) applied to optimization problems, a paradigm where NNs re-parameterize problems without needing external training data. It categorizes existing approaches into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific methods and highlights the critical motivations for this setting, particularly the scarcity of training data in scientific and medical applications like image reconstruction, and the limitations of traditional data-driven learning in certain optimization domains.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The dataless training paradigm has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by enabling the development of advanced computational tools in data-scarce medical environments. This could lead to improved medical image reconstruction with less data or faster acquisition times, better optimization of patient-specific treatment plans (e.g., radiation therapy, drug dosing), and more effective diagnostic algorithms for rare conditions where large training datasets are impractical to acquire. It provides a pathway for sophisticated AI deployment even in resource-constrained or highly specialized clinical settings.</p>

                <p>The abstract, as a survey, does not present novel empirical results or algorithms, and therefore does not detail specific empirical limitations of dataless methods. However, a core motivation for the dataless setting, as highlighted in the abstract, is the inherent limitation of traditional "data-driven learning approaches [which] are still underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results" in certain complex optimization domains.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.</p>
