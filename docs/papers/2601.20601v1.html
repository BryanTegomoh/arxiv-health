                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced deep learning framework for accurate, adaptive, and trustworthy multi-sequence ophthalmic angiography classification (FFA/ICGA). It addresses limitations of existing methods, such as poor generalization and low-confidence predictions, stemming from single-modality data, subtle lesions, and inter-device variability. CLEAR-Mamba achieves superior performance, particularly in multi-disease classification and reliability, through architectural optimizations (HaC for adaptability) and a novel training strategy (RaP for uncertainty-aware predictions), validated on a new large-scale angiography dataset.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.</p>
