                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Biological engineering, the convergence between engineering and biology, is
at the forefront of significant advances in healthcare, agriculture, and
environmental sustainability, making it highly relevant to current scientific
and societal challenges. We take a comprehensive look at this broad and
interdisciplinary domain, structure it into three main areas - bioinspired,
biological and biohybrid approaches - and dissect inherent and fundamental
challenges along with opportunities, highlighting specific examples. We
describe how data-driven discovery and design, in conjunction with artificial
intelligence, can mitigate the absence of reductionist models in these areas.
Additionally, we address the education of a new generation of biological
engineers, emphasizing mathematical, technical, and artificial intelligence
frameworks.</p>
