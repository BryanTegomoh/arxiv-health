                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a Mamba-based deep learning model for accurately detecting sleep disordered breathing (SDB) using a non-intrusive, wireless wearable device, ANNE One, without requiring oxygen flow measurement. The model demonstrated a high correlation (R=0.95) with PSG-derived AHI and strong diagnostic performance at clinically relevant thresholds, along with good epoch-level event identification and promise for detailed event characterization.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly significant for sleep medicine as it offers a non-intrusive, comfortable, and potentially cost-effective method for sleep apnea detection without the need for oxygen flow sensors. Such a wearable device could enable widespread home-based testing, facilitating earlier diagnosis and management of sleep disordered breathing, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on sleep laboratories.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research applies a Mamba-based deep learning model to analyze multimodal sensor data from a wireless wearable device (ANNE One) for the automated detection, diagnosis (prediction of AHI and identification of Sleep Disordered Breathing at clinically relevant thresholds), and characterization (epoch-level event identification, event type, and duration) of sleep apnea. This represents an AI application for non-invasive medical diagnostics and patient monitoring.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved collecting concurrent polysomnography (PSG) and ANNE One wearable sensor recordings from 384 adult participants in a tertiary care sleep laboratory. PSG respiratory events were manually annotated following AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG data were automatically aligned using the ECG signal and visually verified. A deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture was then trained and evaluated using the PSG-derived event labels, with performance assessed on a 57-recording test set.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The Mamba-based deep learning model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting AHI and identifying SDB. It achieved a high AHI correlation (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, MAE 2.83) with PSG, with consistent performance across age and sex. Diagnostic accuracy was robust, showing 96% sensitivity and 87% specificity for AHI>5, and 86% sensitivity with 98% specificity for AHI>15. Epoch-level event detection achieved 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The model also shows potential for advanced physiological characterization, such as differentiating central from other respiratory event types and estimating event duration.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology has the potential to significantly streamline and democratize sleep apnea diagnosis by providing a highly accurate, non-intrusive, and comfortable wearable solution for home monitoring. By removing the need for traditional in-lab PSG and cumbersome oxygen flow sensors, it could increase diagnostic accessibility, reduce healthcare costs, and facilitate earlier intervention for millions of individuals with undiagnosed SDB. The capability for event characterization could also lead to more personalized treatment approaches.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, it can be inferred that the 'promise' for physiological characterization (event type, duration) suggests that this aspect requires further development and validation before clinical application. The study was conducted in a controlled tertiary care lab setting, which may not fully reflect generalizability to diverse real-world home environments or patient populations.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The primary future direction highlighted is to further develop and validate the model's capability for detailed physiological characterization of respiratory events, specifically improving the identification of event types (e.g., central vs. obstructive apnea) and accurately determining event duration. Real-world validation studies outside of controlled lab environments would also be a logical next step.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objectives: We present and evaluate a Mamba-based deep-learning model for diagnosis and event-level characterization of sleep disordered breathing based on signals from the ANNE One, a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography, triaxial accelerometry, chest and finger temperature, and finger phototplethysmography.
  Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.
  Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.
  Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.</p>
