                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Integrated Information Theory (IIT) presents a 'consciousness-first' approach to existence, positing that subjective experience is fundamental and its essential properties (axioms of phenomenal existence) can be formalized into physical postulates. The theory claims an entity's intrinsic cause-effect power upon itself, characterized by specific structure, accounts for all aspects of consciousness, providing an explanatory identity between physical structure and subjective experience.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>IIT offers a foundational theoretical framework for objectively assessing consciousness in clinical settings, which is crucial for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in patients with altered states of consciousness, such as those in comatose, vegetative, or minimally conscious states.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The theoretical framework, particularly its operational aspects, could inform the development of AI tools for more accurate and objective assessment of consciousness in patients. This could include AI-powered diagnostic aids for disorders of consciousness, monitoring systems for patients under anesthesia, or even contribute to the ethical guidelines for advanced medical AI systems concerning potential sentience or their interaction with human consciousness.</p>

                    <li>IIT adopts a 'consciousness-first' ontological stance, asserting that conscious experience is the fundamental evidence for existence and its properties are axiomatic.</li>
                    
                    <li>Axioms of phenomenal existence are translated into operational postulates of physical existence, grounding the theory in both subjective reality and objective physics.</li>
                    
                    <li>Intrinsic existence is defined as an entity's capacity for cause-effect power upon itself, requiring specificity, unity, definiteness, and structure.</li>
                    
                    <li>The 'explanatory identity' principle posits that an entity's unique cause-effect structure comprehensively accounts for all properties of its associated experience, both essential and accidental.</li>
                    
                    <li>This framework explains complex phenomenal features, including the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, the binding of concepts with sensory features into objects, and the qualitative nature of qualia (e.g., colors, sounds).</li>
                    
                    <li>IIT's intrinsic ontology has significant implications for understanding fundamental concepts such as meaning, perception, and free will.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This paper presents a theoretical and conceptual framework, deriving operational postulates of physical existence from axiomatic properties of phenomenal experience. It proposes an explanatory identity between a system's intrinsic cause-effect structure and the subjective experience it generates, rather than reporting empirical findings.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The central theoretical findings of IIT include the assertion that intrinsic cause-effect power defines existence and consciousness, and that the specific structure of this power directly accounts for all properties of a subjective experience, from its existence to its particular qualia. This establishes a direct, non-reductive link between physical structure and phenomenal consciousness.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>IIT's principles can guide the development of new diagnostic tools and biomarkers for precisely evaluating consciousness in non-communicative patients (e.g., post-anoxic brain injury, traumatic brain injury, stroke). This can improve accuracy in distinguishing between vegetative states, minimally conscious states, and locked-in syndrome, thereby informing ethical decisions regarding life support, pain management, and therapeutic interventions, and potentially refining prognostication.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. As a theoretical framework, potential limitations might include the empirical testability of all its postulates, the practical challenges in quantifying 'cause-effect power' in complex biological systems, and the current difficulty in directly translating its mathematical formalism into widely accessible clinical tools.</p>

                <p>Future research will likely focus on applying IIT's principles to develop and refine clinical metrics for consciousness assessment, investigate specific neural correlates of cause-effect structures associated with different states of consciousness, and explore its implications for understanding the mechanisms of general anesthesia, psychedelic states, and the neural basis of various psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's
"consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to
each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential
properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties
operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist
intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon
itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's
explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts
for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no
additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness,
temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular
configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's
intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and
free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and
artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.</p>
