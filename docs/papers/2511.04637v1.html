                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical challenge of stalled genetic risk factor discovery for variants of intermediate allele frequency and effect size, dubbed the "missing middle," which are poorly characterized by current methods optimized for rare or common variants. It reviews existing strategies by variant frequency class and proposes innovative methodological advancements—including variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference—to extend discovery into this understudied range across diverse disease areas. The overarching goal is to provide a conceptual map for more comprehensive risk gene identification across the entire allele frequency spectrum.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>More comprehensive identification of genetic risk factors, particularly those in the understudied 'missing middle,' is vital for enhancing our understanding of complex disease etiologies, improving diagnostic accuracy, developing predictive risk models, and paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions across numerous critical medical domains.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper discusses 'innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference' to extend gene discovery. These methodologies are prime areas for the application of medical AI. Machine learning algorithms can be used for advanced variant annotation (predicting functional impact), sophisticated joint modeling of genetic and phenotypic data, refining disease phenotypes through unsupervised learning or deep learning, and building/analyzing complex biological networks to identify candidate risk genes. AI can enhance statistical power, improve pathogenicity classification, and integrate diverse data types from sequencing and biobanks, thereby accelerating comprehensive risk gene discovery for various health conditions.</p>

                    <p>This paper functions as a comprehensive review, synthesizing current strategies for risk gene identification by organizing them according to variant frequency class.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the identification and characterization of a 'missing middle' in genetic risk factor discovery, consisting of intermediate frequency and effect size variants, which are poorly addressed by current methodologies. The paper finds that this gap is largely due to insufficient statistical power and frequent misclassification of pathogenicity. It proposes that innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling of diverse datasets, rigorous phenotype refinement, and network-based inference are crucial strategies to overcome these limitations and effectively discover these 'missing' genetic risks.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Successfully identifying genetic risk factors within the 'missing middle' would have significant clinical impact. It could lead to a more complete understanding of disease pathogenesis for many complex disorders, enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis, better patient stratification for clinical trials, and the development of novel, personalized therapeutic targets. For instance, understanding these intermediate variants could refine risk prediction for conditions like schizophrenia or inform tailored cancer prevention strategies.</p>

                <p>The paper identifies critical limitations in current genetic discovery approaches, specifically their optimization for the extremes of the allele frequency spectrum. This creates a 'blind spot' for intermediate frequency variants, where existing methods exhibit limited statistical power, frequently misclassify pathogenicity, and fail to capture their full heritable contribution, thus impeding comprehensive risk gene discovery.</p>

This necessitates investment in novel computational and statistical methodologies capable of handling the complexity of these variants and their interactions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the
pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of
sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the
extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants
identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by
genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of
intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited,
pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical
evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical
blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk
gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological
strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to
illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype
refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the
intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we
provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and
emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.</p>
