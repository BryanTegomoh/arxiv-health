                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This review identifies a critical gap in genetic risk factor discovery, termed the 'missing middle,' which comprises variants of intermediate allele frequency and effect size that are poorly addressed by current methods. It analyzes the limitations of existing approaches optimized for rare or common variants and proposes innovative strategies to enable comprehensive risk gene identification across the entire allele frequency spectrum.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper discusses 'innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference' to extend gene discovery. These methodologies often leverage advanced computational techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, to process large genomic and phenotypic datasets. AI/ML applications could include developing algorithms for predicting pathogenicity of intermediate frequency variants, identifying complex gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, improving variant annotation precision, and building network models to prioritize disease-associated genes. Ultimately, this research provides a framework for where AI could be applied to accelerate comprehensive genetic risk assessment and drug target identification.</p>

                    <p>This is a review paper that synthesizes and organizes strategies for risk gene identification based on variant frequency class. It critically analyzes the methodological strengths and constraints of current approaches (e.g., burden testing, GWAS) and proposes new conceptual and analytical innovations, such as advanced variant annotation, joint statistical modeling, refined phenotype definitions, and network-based biological inference, to address the challenge of discovering intermediate-frequency variants.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the identification and characterization of the 'missing middle' in genetic risk factor discovery, where variants of intermediate allele frequency and effect size are poorly detected by current methods. The paper finds that this limitation is due to insufficient statistical power and frequent misclassification of pathogenicity. It concludes that a multi-faceted approach incorporating advanced variant annotation, joint modeling of genetic effects, precise phenotype definition, and network-based inference is essential for bridging this gap and enabling comprehensive risk gene discovery.</p>

                <p>Identifying previously unrecognized genetic risk factors, particularly those in the intermediate frequency range, will significantly advance precision medicine. This could lead to earlier and more accurate disease diagnosis, improved patient stratification for personalized treatment regimens and clinical trials, the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, and a deeper mechanistic understanding of complex diseases across psychiatry, neurology, oncology, and gerontology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the
pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of
sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the
extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants
identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by
genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of
intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited,
pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical
evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical
blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk
gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological
strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to
illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype
refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the
intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we
provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and
emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.</p>
