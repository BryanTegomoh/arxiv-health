                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This review paper addresses the challenge of stalled genetic risk factor discovery, particularly highlighting the 'missing middle' of variants with intermediate allele frequencies and effect sizes that are poorly captured by current methods. It systematically organizes existing strategies by variant frequency and proposes innovative approaches, including advanced variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference, to enhance discovery in this critical underserved range. The ultimate goal is to provide a conceptual framework for comprehensive risk gene identification across the entire allele frequency spectrum.</p>

                    <p>This paper is a review that synthesizes and organizes existing strategies for risk gene identification based on variant frequency.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that current gene discovery methodologies are inadequate for a significant portion of the allele frequency spectrum – the 'missing middle' of intermediate frequency, intermediate-effect variants. This methodological gap leads to misclassification and stalled discovery, limiting our understanding of heritable contributions to complex diseases. The review identifies specific advanced strategies that hold promise for overcoming these limitations and enabling more comprehensive risk gene identification.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Successful implementation of the proposed strategies would lead to a more complete and accurate understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases. This could translate into improved early disease risk prediction, more precise diagnostic classification, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, ultimately paving the way for more personalized and effective medical interventions across various prevalent disorders.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The core limitation highlighted is that current gene discovery approaches, such as burden testing and GWAS, are statistically underpowered or inappropriate for variants of intermediate allele frequency and effect size. This results in misclassification of pathogenicity and a substantial 'blind spot' in our understanding of genetic risk factors for many complex human diseases.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on developing and integrating sophisticated methodological innovations like advanced variant annotation, multi-modal joint modeling of genetic and phenotypic data, precise phenotype refinement, and network-based inference. The goal is to systematically apply these strategies to uncover the 'missing middle' of genetic risk factors, thereby achieving more comprehensive risk gene discovery across the entire allele frequency spectrum.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the
pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of
sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the
extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants
identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by
genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of
intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited,
pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical
evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical
blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk
gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological
strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to
illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype
refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the
intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we
provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and
emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.</p>
