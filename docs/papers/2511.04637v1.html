                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the
pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of
sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the
extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants
identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by
genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of
intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited,
pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical
evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical
blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk
gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological
strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to
illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype
refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the
intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we
provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and
emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.</p>
