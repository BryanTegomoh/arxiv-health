                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Bayesian latent class framework that integrates clinical domain knowledge via informative priors to enhance phenotype discovery from electronic health record (EHR) data. Applied to a large asthma cohort, it successfully identified an "uncontrolled T2-high" sub-phenotype (38.7% of patients) characterized by elevated eosinophils, allergy markers, and surprisingly high healthcare utilization/medication use. This demonstrates the model's utility for hypothesis generation and cohort identification in heterogeneous diseases lacking clear phenotype definitions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is crucial for advancing precision medicine by enabling the discovery of clinically meaningful sub-phenotypes within complex and heterogeneous diseases like asthma. Identifying such subgroups allows for more targeted therapies, personalized patient management strategies, and improved allocation of healthcare resources, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper applies Bayesian latent class modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. This AI application is used to discover and characterize clinically meaningful disease sub-phenotypes (e.g., 'uncontrolled T2-high' asthma) by incorporating prior medical knowledge. This facilitates hypothesis generation, patient cohort identification, and potentially leads to more targeted and effective treatment strategies for heterogeneous diseases, thus advancing precision medicine through AI-driven insights from real-world health data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a Bayesian latent class model, a statistical framework for unsupervised clustering. It integrates clinical domain knowledge by using *informative priors* for specific features (e.g., T2 inflammation-related biomarkers like eosinophils and allergy markers) and *weakly informative priors* for other clinical variables (e.g., healthcare utilization, medication use). The model is designed to handle missing data, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns, and provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment along with associated uncertainty estimates. The approach was applied using reusable and flexible code to a large EHR cohort of asthma patients.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The analysis of 44,642 adult asthma patients revealed a bimodal posterior distribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear separation into distinct patient classes. A prominent class, comprising 38.7% of the cohort, was characterized by elevated eosinophil levels and allergy markers, consistent with Type 2 inflammation. Crucially, this T2-informed class also demonstrated significantly higher healthcare utilization and medication use, leading to the identification of an 'uncontrolled T2-high' asthma sub-phenotype. This association of T2 inflammation markers with high resource utilization emerged robustly, even with only weakly informative priors on the utilization variables.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework offers a powerful tool for clinicians and researchers to move beyond 'one-size-fits-all' approaches for complex diseases. By clearly delineating an 'uncontrolled T2-high' asthma sub-phenotype, it provides actionable insights for personalized treatment decisions, potentially guiding the use of targeted biologics, improving disease management strategies, and optimizing resource allocation for specific patient groups. It facilitates precision medicine by supporting the generation of new clinical hypotheses and the precise identification of patient cohorts for interventional studies.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations in such studies typically include dependence on EHR data quality, generalizability of findings to other populations or healthcare systems, and the observational nature of EHR data which inherently limits causal inferences. The work is presented as an illustration of utility, suggesting further validation and broader application would be necessary.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objectives: Unsupervised learning with electronic health record (EHR) data
has shown promise for phenotype discovery, but approaches typically disregard
existing clinical information, limiting interpretability. We operationalize a
Bayesian latent class framework for phenotyping that incorporates
domain-specific knowledge to improve clinical meaningfulness of EHR-derived
phenotypes and illustrate its utility by identifying an asthma sub-phenotype
informed by features of Type 2 (T2) inflammation.
  Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical
knowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide
unsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach
models missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns,
and provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with
uncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large
asthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related
features and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing
the data to inform posterior distributions.
  Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February
2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior
distribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2
inflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil
levels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication
use, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns
suggest an "uncontrolled T2-high" sub-phenotype. This demonstrates how our
Bayesian latent class modeling approach supports hypothesis generation and
cohort identification in EHR-based studies of heterogeneous diseases without
well-established phenotype definitions.</p>
