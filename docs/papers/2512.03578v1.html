                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MAGNETS is an inherently interpretable neural network architecture for TSER. Its core methodology involves learning a set of 'concepts' through a 'mask-and-aggregate' mechanism. Each concept is generated by a learned mask that identifies relevant features and temporal segments within the input time series, followed by an aggregation operation. These concepts are then combined in a transparent, additive manner to produce the final regression prediction, all without requiring explicit concept supervision.</p>

                    <p>The abstract describes the conceptual and design achievements of MAGNETS rather than experimental results. Key findings include the successful design of an inherently interpretable neural network that effectively learns human-understandable concepts from time series data without external supervision. It explicitly identifies the specific features and temporal patterns driving predictions via mask-based aggregation and provides a transparent decision process through an additive combination of learned concepts. This design effectively addresses several limitations inherent in prior black-box and post-hoc interpretability methods.</p>

                <p>This technology could profoundly impact clinical practice by integrating AI into decision-making processes with a crucial layer of transparency. Clinicians could use MAGNETS to understand *why* a patient is at high risk of deterioration (e.g., specific vital sign changes over certain hours), leading to earlier and more targeted interventions. It could also facilitate personalized treatment plans by elucidating how different patient parameters influence drug responses or disease progression, and aid in discovering new clinical insights or biomarkers from complex physiological data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.
  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.</p>
