                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Problem Addressed:** Prior generative models for disease progression suffer from scattered latent representations and disruption of continuity (e.g., diffusion models), failing to capture the inherently continuous and monotonic nature of disease. Auto-Encoders (AEs) also lack guarantees for cross-patient latent alignment or correlation with clinical severity.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Core Methodology - Flow Matching:** The disease dynamic is conceptualized as a continuous velocity field, and Flow Matching (FM) is employed to align the temporal evolution of patient data, allowing for the capture of intrinsic disease dynamics.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Novel Latent Alignment Strategy:** A key innovation is learning patient-specific latent alignment. This enforces patient trajectories within the latent space to lie along a consistent, specific axis, with magnitude along this axis increasing monotonically with disease severity indicators (e.g., age, disease conditions).</li>
                    
                    <li>**Semantically Meaningful Latent Space:** This alignment strategy constructs a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space, which is crucial for interpretable disease progression modeling.</li>
                    
                    <li>**$Δ$-LFM Framework:** The proposed framework, $Δ$-LFM, integrates Flow Matching with this patient-specific latent alignment to model latent progression.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Empirical Validation:** $Δ$-LFM demonstrated strong empirical performance across three distinct longitudinal MRI benchmarks.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Enhanced Interpretability:** Beyond quantitative performance, the framework provides a new and improved means for interpreting and visualizing complex disease dynamics due to its structured and semantically rich latent representation.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves mapping high-dimensional longitudinal imaging data (e.g., MRI) into a lower-dimensional latent space using Auto-Encoders. Within this latent space, Flow Matching (FM) is utilized to model disease progression as a continuous velocity field, effectively aligning the temporal evolution of patient data. A novel patient-specific latent alignment mechanism is introduced to structure this latent space, ensuring that individual patient trajectories follow a specific axis, with magnitude monotonically correlated to clinical severity. The combined framework is termed $Δ$-LFM.</p>

                    <p>The $Δ$-LFM framework successfully learns patient-specific latent disease progression, exhibiting strong empirical performance on multiple longitudinal MRI benchmarks. It effectively captures the intrinsic, continuous, and monotonic nature of disease dynamics. Crucially, it generates a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space where progression along a defined axis directly correlates with increasing disease severity. This provides a novel and powerful means for interpreting and visualizing disease trajectories.</p>

It supports the development of personalized treatment strategies by providing insights into individual patient trajectories and predicted disease courses. The framework can enhance disease monitoring, allow for better prognosis prediction, and potentially aid in the discovery of novel imaging-based biomarkers. Moreover, it could optimize clinical trial design by facilitating more precise patient stratification based on expected progression.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.</p>
