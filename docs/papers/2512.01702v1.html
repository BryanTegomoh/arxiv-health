                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel geometry-independent operator-learning framework that uses a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to predict local activation time (LAT) fields in cardiac electrophysiology. It achieves a high accuracy (5.1 ms mean error) and near-instantaneous inference (0.12 ms/sample) across diverse left atrial anatomies, outperforming established methods. The framework decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology using a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, enabling real-time and population-scale computational electrophysiology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.</p>
