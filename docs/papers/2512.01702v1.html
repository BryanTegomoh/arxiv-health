                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel geometry-independent operator-learning framework, utilizing a vision-transformer backbone, to predict local activation time (LAT) fields in the left atrium. The framework, trained on 308,700 simulations across 147 diverse patient-specific anatomies represented in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, achieves highly accurate (5.1 ms error) and near-instantaneous (0.12 ms inference) predictions. This breakthrough enables real-time computational electrophysiology for personalized arrhythmia treatment and large-scale analyses, addressing a critical bottleneck in current clinical workflows.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.</p>
