                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces FairGRPO, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach designed to mitigate performance disparities of medical AI across diverse demographic groups, which often suffer harm from biased systems. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance weighting and unsupervised clustering for latent group discovery, demonstrating significant reductions in predictive parity (27.2%) and improvements in F1 score (12.49%) across various clinical diagnostic tasks, culminating in the release of FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The primary AI application is the development of fair and equitable medical AI diagnostic systems. Specifically, it focuses on creating Vision-Language Large Language Models (VLLMs) that can perform clinical reasoning and diagnosis by integrating diverse medical data (e.g., imaging like X-rays, CT scans, mammograms, ultrasound, dermoscopy). The goal is to ensure these AI systems provide accurate and unbiased diagnoses across different demographic groups, thereby mitigating performance disparities and promoting healthcare equity.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>FairGRPO is a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that promotes equitable learning. Its core mechanism involves adaptively weighting the advantages during policy optimization, with weights determined by three factors: the demographic group's representation within the dataset, the inherent difficulty of the diagnostic task for that specific group, and the data source. To overcome the prevalent issue of missing explicit demographic labels in clinical datasets, FairGRPO integrates unsupervised clustering, which automatically discovers and categorizes latent demographic groups for targeted bias mitigation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>FairGRPO significantly reduces predictive parity by 27.2% across demographic groups when compared to all vanilla and bias-mitigated RL baselines. Concurrently, it improves the overall F1 score by 12.49%. Training dynamics analysis revealed that FairGRPO progressively enhances fairness throughout the optimization process, a notable advantage over baseline RL methods where fairness tends to degrade. The resulting FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM, achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance while demonstrating significantly reduced demographic disparities.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The proposed FairGRPO method and the resulting FairMedGemma-4B model have the potential to deliver more equitable and reliable clinical decision support. By mitigating AI bias and improving diagnostic accuracy across diverse patient populations, it can lead to fewer diagnostic errors, especially for underrepresented groups, thus improving patient outcomes and fostering greater trust in AI-driven healthcare technologies. This directly supports the goal of providing more inclusive and high-quality medical care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.</p>
