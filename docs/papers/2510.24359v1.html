                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research proposes a multi-agent AI ecosystem designed for N-of-1 (individualized) decision support in precision medicine. It aims to provide clinicians with highly tailored decision-support packets, including patient-specific risk estimates, confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence, particularly for patients who deviate from population averages due to rare conditions, complex comorbidities, or underrepresented demographics. The AI seeks to enhance equity and trust in medical decision-making by focusing on individual patient needs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.</p>
