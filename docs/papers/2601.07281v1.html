                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Covariance-Driven Regression Trees (CovRT) as a novel approach to mitigate overfitting in decision trees like CART, particularly in deep trees or with small sample sizes. By using a covariance-driven splitting criterion instead of empirical risk minimization, CovRT achieves more balanced and stable splits and identifies covariates with true signals more effectively. The method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both theoretical proofs and empirical validations, enhancing model robustness and interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Overfitting is a critical challenge in developing robust predictive models from complex and often limited medical datasets, leading to models that perform poorly on new patients. CovRT offers a more reliable and accurate method for building decision trees for medical diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification, directly enhancing the trustworthiness and utility of clinical decision support systems.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology involves the development of Covariance-Driven Regression Trees (CovRT), which fundamentally alters the splitting criterion used in standard CART. Instead of the empirical risk minimization criterion, CovRT employs a novel covariance-driven splitting criterion.

The method was then empirically validated against CART using both synthetic data from simulations and real-world datasets, focusing on prediction accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Decision trees are powerful machine learning algorithms, widely used in fields such as economics and medicine for their simplicity and interpretability. However, decision trees such as CART are prone to overfitting, especially when grown deep or the sample size is small. Conventional methods to reduce overfitting include pre-pruning and post-pruning, which constrain the growth of uninformative branches. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach by introducing a covariance-driven splitting criterion for regression trees (CovRT). This method is more robust to overfitting than the empirical risk minimization criterion used in CART, as it produces more balanced and stable splits and more effectively identifies covariates with true signals. We establish an oracle inequality of CovRT and prove that its predictive accuracy is comparable to that of CART in high-dimensional settings. We find that CovRT achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both simulations and real-world tasks.</p>
