                <p>The paper focuses on mathematical epidemiology models rather than AI. While these models provide foundational understanding that can inform or be integrated into AI applications for public health, disease forecasting, or resource allocation, the paper itself does not describe an AI application.</p>

                    <p>The paper employs a comprehensive narrative review methodology, systematically examining and synthesizing existing theoretical frameworks and practical applications of mathematical epidemiology models. It evaluates these models from a mechanistic perspective, focusing on their structure, assumptions, outputs, and limitations within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The paper reveals that mathematical models are indispensable tools for quantifying and predicting complex COVID-19 dynamics, offering insights into heterogeneous transmission patterns (e.g., superspreading), the dose-response of NPIs, the critical thresholds for vaccine-induced herd immunity, and the potential for viral evolution to undermine vaccine effectiveness. A key finding is that while powerful, all such models possess inherent deficiencies that necessitate careful interpretation and continuous refinement.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The insights derived from this modeling review directly influence clinical and public health practice by informing optimal timing and intensity of NPIs, guiding vaccine distribution strategies to achieve population-level immunity, predicting healthcare system burdens, and anticipating the emergence of vaccine-resistant viral strains. This provides a quantitative foundation for evidence-based clinical guidelines and public health interventions during pandemics.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The paper explicitly highlights and discusses the "deficiencies" inherent in the mathematical models it reviews. These limitations likely stem from simplifying assumptions, data scarcity, challenges in parameter estimation, and difficulties in accurately capturing complex human behavioral responses and social dynamics, thereby limiting their predictive accuracy and generalizability.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Implicitly, the identified "deficiencies" in current mathematical models suggest future research should focus on developing more sophisticated models that better integrate real-world complexities, enhance data assimilation techniques, refine parameterization, and adapt more rapidly to evolving epidemiological landscapes and viral variants. Further work is needed to improve model robustness and predictive power in dynamic pandemic settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Since the start of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many modeling efforts to assess several issues of importance to public health. In this work, we review the theory behind some important mathematical models that have been used to answer questions raised by the development of the pandemic. We start revisiting the basic properties of simple Kermack-McKendrick type models. Then, we discuss extensions of such models and important epidemiological quantities applied to investigate the role of heterogeneity in disease transmission e.g. mixing functions and superspreading events, the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the control of the pandemic, vaccine deployment, herd-immunity, viral evolution and the possibility of vaccine escape. From the perspective of mathematical epidemiology, we highlight the important properties, findings, and, of course, deficiencies, that all these models have.</p>
