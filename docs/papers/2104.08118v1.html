                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper provides a comprehensive primer and overview of mathematical models used to analyze and understand the COVID-19 pandemic. It reviews the theory behind Kermack-McKendrick type models and their extensions, exploring their application in addressing critical public health issues like transmission heterogeneity, intervention efficacy, vaccine strategies, and viral evolution. The review critically highlights the properties, findings, and inherent deficiencies of these epidemiological models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This review is highly relevant for public health decision-makers, epidemiologists, and healthcare professionals as it provides a critical synthesis of the modeling tools that inform pandemic response strategies. Understanding these models is crucial for interpreting projections, evaluating interventions, and optimizing resource allocation in clinical and public health settings.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper focuses on mathematical epidemiology models rather than AI algorithms explicitly, the concepts and models discussed (e.g., disease transmission, vaccine efficacy, viral evolution, impact of interventions) are foundational for developing and applying AI models in health. AI/ML techniques are frequently used to estimate parameters for these epidemiological models, forecast disease spread, optimize intervention strategies (like vaccine distribution), identify superspreading events, and predict viral evolution. Thus, this paper provides critical theoretical background that informs the development and application of AI in epidemic response and public health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Since the start of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many modeling efforts to assess several issues of importance to public health. In this work, we review the theory behind some important mathematical models that have been used to answer questions raised by the development of the pandemic. We start revisiting the basic properties of simple Kermack-McKendrick type models. Then, we discuss extensions of such models and important epidemiological quantities applied to investigate the role of heterogeneity in disease transmission e.g. mixing functions and superspreading events, the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the control of the pandemic, vaccine deployment, herd-immunity, viral evolution and the possibility of vaccine escape. From the perspective of mathematical epidemiology, we highlight the important properties, findings, and, of course, deficiencies, that all these models have.</p>
