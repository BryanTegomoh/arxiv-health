                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While epidemiological modeling is a domain where AI/Machine Learning techniques are increasingly applied, this paper specifically focuses on traditional 'mathematical epidemiology' and 'Kermack-McKendrick type models'. It does not describe or utilize AI methods or applications within its scope. It provides foundational knowledge that could inform AI applications in epidemiology, but is not an AI application itself.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Since the start of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many modeling efforts to assess several issues of importance to public health. In this work, we review the theory behind some important mathematical models that have been used to answer questions raised by the development of the pandemic. We start revisiting the basic properties of simple Kermack-McKendrick type models. Then, we discuss extensions of such models and important epidemiological quantities applied to investigate the role of heterogeneity in disease transmission e.g. mixing functions and superspreading events, the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the control of the pandemic, vaccine deployment, herd-immunity, viral evolution and the possibility of vaccine escape. From the perspective of mathematical epidemiology, we highlight the important properties, findings, and, of course, deficiencies, that all these models have.</p>
