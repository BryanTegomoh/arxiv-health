                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a novel label-free latent diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic echocardiography videos. It leverages self-supervised motion features, extracted by a custom Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE) with auxiliary re-identification and optical flow losses, to condition video generation. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive and clinically realistic video synthesis without requiring manual labels.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper presents the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework for generating echocardiography videos. Its core is a self-supervised conditioning mechanism: a dedicated Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE) is trained to disentangle motion and appearance representations from video sequences. To boost feature learning, MAFE incorporates two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. The extracted self-supervised motion features then serve as the conditioning input for the diffusion model, guiding the synthesis of temporally coherent and realistic echocardiography videos.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Ultrasound echocardiography is essential for the non-invasive, real-time assessment of cardiac function, but the scarcity of labelled data, driven by privacy restrictions and the complexity of expert annotation, remains a major obstacle for deep learning methods. We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZheLi2020/LabelfreeMCDM.</p>
