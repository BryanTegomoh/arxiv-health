                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (MDS), a novel vision-language task that aims to provide both medical image segmentation masks and explainable diagnostic results in response to clinical queries. To facilitate this, the authors present the M3DS dataset and propose Sim4Seg, a framework leveraging a Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module and a test-time scaling strategy. Experimental results demonstrate Sim4Seg's superior performance over baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite significant progress in pixel-level medical image analysis, existing
medical image segmentation models rarely explore medical segmentation and
diagnosis tasks jointly. However, it is crucial for patients that models can
provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this
paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis
Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical
images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic
results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease
Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal
multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks
and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis
chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel
framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking
advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M)
module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling
strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.</p>
