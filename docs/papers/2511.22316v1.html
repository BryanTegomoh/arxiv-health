                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SingleQuant, a novel single-pass quantization framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that addresses convergence issues and performance degradation in existing methods. By decoupling quantization truncation from gradient optimization and employing specialized rotation transformations (ART and URT), SingleQuant significantly improves quantization speed and task performance of LLMs. It achieves this by eliminating non-smoothness and gradient noise previously introduced by Straight-Through Estimators on Stiefel manifolds.</p>

                    <p>SingleQuant employs a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation. It addresses activation outliers and distribution reshaping using two novel components: Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT). ART achieves optimal smoothing of outlier values through closed-form optimal rotations, while URT reshapes distributions via geometric mapping. Both transformations are constructed from strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and angles, designed to operate without introducing the non-smoothness or gradient noise issues found in existing STE-based methods.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) quantization facilitates deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings, but existing methods that combine incompatible gradient optimization and quantization truncation lead to serious convergence pathology. This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization. For example, when quantizing LLaMA-2-13B, SingleQuant achieves 1,400$\times$ quantization speedup and increases +0.57\% average task performance compared to the selected best baseline.</p>
