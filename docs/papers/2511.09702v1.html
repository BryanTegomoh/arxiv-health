                    <li>Current phonotrauma severity assessment relies on clinician expert judgment, which is costly, subjective, and exhibits variable reliability.</li>

                    <li>An ordinal regression framework is adopted to explicitly account for the natural ordinal (e.g., mild to severe) nature of phonotrauma severity labels.</li>
                    
                    <li>A novel 'soft ordinal regression' method is proposed, which modifies standard ordinal regression loss functions to operate on 'soft labels' that represent the distribution of expert ratings, thereby modeling label uncertainty.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a deep learning approach within an ordinal regression framework applied to vocal fold images. The core innovation is a novel 'soft ordinal regression' technique where loss functions are modified to accept 'soft labels.' These soft labels are probability distributions derived from multiple annotator ratings, allowing the model to explicitly account for and learn from label uncertainty and inter-rater variability, rather than relying on a single, crisp label.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.</p>
