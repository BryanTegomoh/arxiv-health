                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces FairLRF, a novel fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework designed to enhance deep learning model fairness, particularly in sensitive domains like medical diagnosis. Unlike traditional applications of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for model compression, FairLRF uniquely leverages SVD to identify and selectively remove bias-inducing elements from the unitary matrices, effectively reducing group disparities. The method demonstrates superior performance over conventional LRF and state-of-the-art fairness techniques, addressing limitations of existing computationally expensive or accuracy-compromising debiasing strategies.</p>

                    <p>FairLRF proposes a sparse low rank factorization framework that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.</p>
