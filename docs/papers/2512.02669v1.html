                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates four distinct modeling approaches—ViT-OF, 1D-CNN, BiLSTM-OF, and Hierarchical XGBoost—for classifying dysarthria severity into five classes using a common speech dataset. While the feature-engineered Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble achieved the highest macro-F1 score of 0.86, deep learning models also demonstrated competitive performance (0.70 macro-F1), offering complementary perspectives for automated speech analysis in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized a common dataset of speech recordings for a five-class dysarthria severity classification task. Four distinct models were developed and evaluated: (1) ViT-OF, applying a Vision Transformer to spectrogram images; (2) a 1D-CNN approach, employing an ensemble of eight 1-D CNNs with majority-vote fusion; (3) a BiLSTM-OF approach, using an ensemble of nine BiLSTM models with majority-vote fusion; and (4) a Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble, which combined glottal and formant features within a two-stage learning framework. All models were compared based on their macro-F1 scores on a validation set of 53 speakers.</p>

                    <p>The Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble, leveraging a two-stage learning framework on glottal and formant features, achieved the highest performance with a macro-F1 score of 0.86. The deep learning models (ViT-OF, 1D-CNN, BiLSTM-OF) also demonstrated competitive macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.70. This indicates that while advanced feature engineering coupled with traditional machine learning can yield superior results for this specific task, deep learning approaches offer robust alternatives and distinct analytical perspectives.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work contributes to the development of objective, quantitative measures for dysarthria severity, reducing reliance on subjective clinical assessment. It has the potential to enhance the accuracy and consistency of diagnosis, facilitate monitoring of disease progression in neurodegenerative conditions, and support personalized rehabilitation strategies for patients with speech impairments by providing an automated, consistent evaluation tool.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The evaluation was performed on a relatively small validation set of 53 speakers, which might limit the generalizability of the findings to a broader population. The abstract does not detail the performance per individual severity class, which could be important for fine-grained clinical utility, nor does it discuss the computational complexity or real-time applicability of the proposed models.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated, the mention of 'complementary insights' suggests future research could focus on developing hybrid ensemble strategies that combine the strengths of feature-engineered models (like XGBoost) with deep learning architectures to potentially achieve higher accuracy and robustness. Expanding the dataset size and diversity, along with investigating the interpretability of deep learning models, would also be valuable next steps for clinical deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper presents a unified study of four distinct modeling approaches for classifying dysarthria severity in the Speech Analysis for Neurodegenerative Diseases (SAND) challenge. All models tackle the same five class classification task using a common dataset of speech recordings. We investigate: (1) a ViT-OF method leveraging a Vision Transformer on spectrogram images, (2) a 1D-CNN approach using eight 1-D CNN's with majority-vote fusion, (3) a BiLSTM-OF approach using nine BiLSTM models with majority vote fusion, and (4) a Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble that combines glottal and formant features through a two stage learning framework. Each method is described, and their performances on a validation set of 53 speakers are compared. Results show that while the feature-engineered XGBoost ensemble achieves the highest macro-F1 (0.86), the deep learning models (ViT, CNN, BiLSTM) attain competitive F1-scores (0.70) and offer complementary insights into the problem.</p>
