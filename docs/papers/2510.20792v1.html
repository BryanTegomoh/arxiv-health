                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models used for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to subtly poison training data, embedding hidden vulnerabilities that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when these triggers are present, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. The study demonstrates the attack's high effectiveness and stealth across multiple datasets, revealing significant security vulnerabilities in these models with critical implications for applications like drug discovery.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Text-guided graph generation is fundamental for de novo drug design, material science, and chemical synthesis, where models generate molecular structures (graphs) based on desired properties. A backdoor attack could lead to the generation of molecules with unintended, potentially harmful, or ineffective substructures when specific textual prompts are used, severely compromising the safety and efficacy of drug discovery pipelines.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>BadGraph implements a backdoor attack by poisoning the training data of latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. This involves strategically embedding textual triggers within some training samples, associating them with attacker-specified target subgraphs. During the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and diffusion training phases, the model inadvertently learns to associate these triggers with the generation of the specified subgraphs. Consequently, when an input text containing the trigger is provided during inference, the compromised model is compelled to generate a graph containing the attacker's chosen subgraph, while performing normally on clean inputs.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>BadGraph successfully implants effective and stealthy backdoors in text-guided latent diffusion models for graph generation. Attack success rates reach 50% with less than 10% poisoning and exceed 80% with only 24% poisoning, all while causing negligible performance degradation on benign inputs. Crucially, the backdoor is embedded specifically during the VAE and diffusion training stages of the model, rather than during initial pretraining. These findings underscore a significant security vulnerability in these generative AI models.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>In drug discovery and development, backdoored generative AI models could be exploited to design molecules with hidden toxicophores, undesirable pharmacological properties, or even specific 'tags' for tracking or malicious identification. This could lead to the generation of unsafe drug candidates, wasted research resources, or the proliferation of potentially harmful compounds into research pipelines. It necessitates rigorous security audits and robust defense mechanisms for AI models used in sensitive biomedical applications to prevent compromise and ensure the integrity of generated therapeutic agents or materials.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</p>
