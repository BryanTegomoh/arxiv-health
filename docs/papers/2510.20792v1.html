                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models used for text-guided graph generation. By poisoning training data with textual triggers, BadGraph covertly implants vulnerabilities that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers are present, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. The research demonstrates high attack success rates with low poisoning rates, highlighting significant security risks for applications like drug discovery.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>BadGraph employs a data poisoning strategy where specific textual triggers are strategically injected into the training dataset used for latent diffusion models, which are tasked with text-guided graph generation. During the model's training, particularly in the VAE and diffusion training phases, an association is covertly established between the textual trigger and the generation of an attacker-specified subgraph. This ensures that when the trigger is presented during inference, the compromised model reliably produces the predefined malicious subgraph, while maintaining its normal generative capabilities for clean inputs.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study empirically demonstrates BadGraph's high effectiveness and stealth across four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu). A poisoning rate below 10% achieved a 50% attack success rate, which increased to over 80% with a 24% poisoning rate. Crucially, the attack maintains the model's normal performance on benign inputs, making it difficult to detect. Ablation studies confirmed that the backdoor mechanism is primarily embedded during the VAE and diffusion training stages, rather than during pretraining.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The direct clinical impact lies in drug discovery and development. If AI models used to generate potential drug candidates or novel molecular structures are compromised by BadGraph, they could be coerced to produce incorrect, ineffective, or even toxic molecules. This could waste significant research and development resources, delay the development of life-saving drugs, or, in worst-case scenarios, lead to the accidental synthesis and testing of harmful compounds, posing direct risks to patient safety and public health by introducing erroneous or dangerous chemical entities into the development pipeline.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily focuses on presenting the attack's existence and effectiveness, and does not explicitly detail specific limitations of the BadGraph method itself, such as its computational cost, the complexity of crafting effective triggers, or its scalability to extremely large and diverse datasets. It also does not discuss potential defense mechanisms against BadGraph, nor the feasibility of detecting such an attack in a real-world deployment. However, it implicitly highlights a major limitation of current latent diffusion models: their inherent vulnerability to targeted data poisoning attacks.</p>

                <p>The paper strongly emphasizes the critical need for developing robust defenses against backdoor attacks in latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. This includes future research into detection mechanisms for poisoned training data, methods for verifying model integrity post-training, and the development of more secure and resilient AI architectures, particularly for sensitive applications like drug discovery where model trustworthiness is paramount.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</p>
