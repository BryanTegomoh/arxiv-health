                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BadGraph, a novel backdoor attack targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, a critical technology in areas like drug discovery. The attack leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that compel the model to generate attacker-specified subgraphs when triggers are present during inference, all while preserving normal performance on benign inputs. BadGraph demonstrates high efficacy (over 80% attack success rate with 24% poisoning) and stealth, exposing significant security vulnerabilities in these generative AI models.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>BadGraph implements a data poisoning attack. It involves carefully crafting a small subset of training data where specific textual triggers are paired with target graphs that contain attacker-specified subgraphs. This poisoned data is then used to train latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. The backdoor functionality is implicitly learned and embedded within the model's parameters during both the VAE and diffusion training stages, ensuring that the malicious subgraph is generated only when the specific textual trigger is present in the input.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study demonstrates that BadGraph effectively implants backdoors in latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation with high success rates (e.g., >80% ASR with 24% poisoning) while maintaining stealth (negligible performance impact on benign samples). Ablation studies pinpoint the VAE and diffusion training as the critical phases for backdoor implantation. These findings reveal a significant security vulnerability, particularly concerning for high-stakes applications like drug discovery.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to covertly inject backdoors into models used for molecular design could lead to the systematic generation of drug candidates with hidden, harmful substructures, resulting in failed clinical trials, wasted resources, or even the accidental development of unsafe compounds. This necessitates a re-evaluation of security protocols for AI models in pharmaceutical R&D, potentially requiring rigorous auditing of training data and models to prevent such malicious manipulations and ensure patient safety.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</p>
