                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SCISOR is a novel discrete diffusion model. Its core methodology involves a forward noising process where random insertions are applied to natural protein sequences. A neural network, termed a de-noiser, is then trained to reverse this process, effectively learning to perform deletions. This training enables SCISOR to generate protein samples that resemble natural sequences, even after significant shortening, by inferring which residues can be removed while maintaining sequence integrity and function. Its performance was evaluated on evolutionary sequence data fitting and functional prediction using the ProteinGym benchmark.</p>

                <p>The ability to computationally shrink proteins while preserving function has substantial clinical impact. It could lead to the design of improved protein therapeutics (e.g., antibodies, enzymes, hormones) that are smaller, more stable, easier to manufacture at scale, and more amenable to various drug delivery routes (e.g., oral, inhaled, better tissue penetration). This could reduce development costs, shorten timelines for drug discovery, and enable novel protein-based interventions for a wider range of diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to
make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in
the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences
typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we
could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature
to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in
nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the
combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases
to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel
discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate
protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a
de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to
natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence
data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves
state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on
ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein
sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more
realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous
models of evolutionary sequences.</p>
