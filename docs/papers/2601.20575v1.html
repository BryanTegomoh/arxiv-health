                    <p>The SegRap2025 challenge is structured into two segmentation tasks evaluated on a multi-center, multi-modality CT dataset. Task01 focuses on GTV segmentation using paired ncCT/ceCT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set specifically designed for cross-center generalization. Task02 addresses LN CTV segmentation, leveraging multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set that includes cases with paired CT scans or single modalities (ceCT-only or ncCT-only) to evaluate both cross-center and cross-modality robustness. Performance of the ten participating teams' solutions was primarily measured using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate delineation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV), Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume (LN CTV), and Organ-at-Risk (OAR) from Computed Tomography (CT) scans is essential for precise radiotherapy planning in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Building upon SegRap2023, which focused on OAR and GTV segmentation using single-center paired non-contrast CT (ncCT) and contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) scans, the SegRap2025 challenge aims to enhance the generalizability and robustness of segmentation models across imaging centers and modalities. SegRap2025 comprises two tasks: Task01 addresses GTV segmentation using paired CT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set to evaluate cross-center generalization, and Task02 focuses on LN CTV segmentation using multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set, where each case contains paired CT scans or a single modality, emphasizing both cross-center and cross-modality robustness. This paper presents the challenge setup and provides a comprehensive analysis of the solutions submitted by ten participating teams. For GTV segmentation task, the top-performing models achieved average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 74.61% and 56.79% on the internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. For LN CTV segmentation task, the highest average DSC values reached 60.24%, 60.50%, and 57.23% on paired CT, ceCT-only, and ncCT-only subsets, respectively. SegRap2025 establishes a large-scale multi-center, multi-modality benchmark for evaluating the generalization and robustness in radiotherapy target segmentation, providing valuable insights toward clinically applicable automated radiotherapy planning systems.
