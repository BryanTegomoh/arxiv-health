                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI system (CuisineSense) uses machine learning algorithms (implied by 'classification' and 'detection pipeline' based on IMU data) to infer food intake and classify food types from wearable sensors. This serves as an automated, unobtrusive tool for dietary monitoring, which can be applied in personalized health management, clinical dietary counseling, and large-scale public health interventions for chronic disease prevention.</p>

                    <p>The CuisineSense system integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data from a smartwatch (capturing hand motions) and smart glasses (capturing head dynamics). It employs a two-stage machine learning pipeline: Stage 1 identifies 'eating states' by differentiating characteristic temporal patterns from non-eating activities.

                <p>This system could significantly enhance the objectivity and reliability of dietary assessment in clinical settings and for public health initiatives. It provides a means for continuous, long-term monitoring of food intake without requiring active user input or raising privacy concerns, thus aiding in personalized nutritional counseling, adherence tracking for specific diets (e.g., diabetic diets), and large-scale epidemiological studies on dietary patterns and chronic disease risk among Chinese populations.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations inferred could include the current scope being limited to 11 specific Chinese food categories and evaluation on a relatively small cohort of 10 participants. Generalizability to other cuisines or larger, more diverse populations would likely require further validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at
