                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), a novel approach designed to overcome the inherent trade-offs between prediction accuracy and diversity in ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS). ATFM achieves this by proposing a new inference paradigm called Data-Hierarchical Inference and incorporating dedicated components like Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) and Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM). Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ATFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, yielding superior segmentation performance and more efficient inference.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A simultaneous enhancement of accuracy and diversity of predictions remains a
challenge in ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS) due to the inherent
trade-offs. While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong
potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled
accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and
plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel
inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose
Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference
paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and
data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly,
Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity
of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly
modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\text{trunc}}$ instead of using
sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is
proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending
semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive
evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA
methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves
GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\%$ and $7.3\%$ compared to advanced methods.</p>
