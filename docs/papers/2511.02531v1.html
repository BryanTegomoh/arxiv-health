                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This review paper proposes Causal Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs) as a solution to critical failures in healthcare AI, such as distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability, by learning invariant causal mechanisms instead of mere statistical associations. It explores their methodological foundations, demonstrates clinical value across various applications, and envisions their role in creating patient-specific Causal Digital Twins for in silico clinical experimentation.</p>

                    <p>The paper reviews Causal Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs) which synthesize graph-based representations of complex biomedical data with principles of causal inference. Key methodological components include Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for formalizing causal relationships, disentangled causal representation learning to isolate independent causal factors, and techniques for interventional prediction (predicting effects of interventions) and counterfactual reasoning (evaluating 'what-if' scenarios) applied to graph structures.</p>

These applications collectively illustrate the capacity of CGNNs to learn invariant causal mechanisms, leading to more robust and reliable AI.</p>

                <p>CGNNs hold the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by enhancing the reliability and fairness of AI systems, leading to more accurate diagnoses, more effective and personalized treatment plans, and a deeper mechanistic understanding of diseases and physiological processes. The long-term vision of patient-specific Causal Digital Twins could enable clinicians to perform 'in silico' clinical trials, predicting individual patient responses to interventions without physical experimentation.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>Significant barriers include the substantial computational requirements that currently prevent real-time deployment of CGNNs in clinical settings. Validation presents a major challenge, necessitating multi-modal evidence triangulation far beyond standard cross-validation. Furthermore, there is a risk of 'causal-washing,' where methods employ causal terminology without providing rigorous evidentiary support for their causal claims.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on establishing tiered frameworks to distinguish between causally-inspired architectures and rigorously causally-validated discoveries. Critical priorities involve developing methods capable of making robust causal, rather than purely associational, claims. Integration with large language models for hypothesis generation and CGNNs for mechanistic validation within patient-specific Causal Digital Twin frameworks is also a key area.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.</p>
