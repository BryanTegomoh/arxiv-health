                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology employs a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, respiratory motion signals are extracted from low-resolution images reconstructed from the central region of successive golden-angle radial k-space data. The extracted signals are then used to bin the full k-space data according to different respiratory states. The second stage utilizes the interpretable deep unrolled network, MoraNet, which integrates NUFFT for radial encoding operations and CNN modules for image regularization, to reconstruct high-resolution, motion-resolved images for each binned motion state. The network was trained on retrospective lung MRI data (fully and undersampled) and validated on phantom and volunteer chest data.</p>

                <p>This technology has the potential to significantly enhance the diagnostic quality of MRI scans in the abdomen and lungs by effectively mitigating respiratory motion artifacts, even during free-breathing. This would reduce the need for patient breath-holds, improving comfort and scan completion rates, especially in pediatric, critically ill, or uncooperative patients. The improved image quality could lead to more accurate detection and characterization of pathologies, while the faster reconstruction time can streamline clinical workflow.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Due to the prolonged MRI encoding process, respiratory motion can cause undesired artifacts and image blurring, degrading image quality and limiting clinical applications in abdominal and pulmonary imaging. In this work, we develop a two-stage respiratory motion-resolved radial MR image reconstruction pipeline using an interpretable deep unrolled network (MoraNet), enabling high-quality imaging under free-breathing conditions. Firstly, low-resolution images are reconstructed from the central region of successive golden-angle radial k-space to extract respiratory motion signals. The binned k-space data based on the respiratory signal are then used to reconstruct the motion-resolved high-resolution image for each motion state. The MoraNet applies nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to operate radial encoding and convolutional neural network (CNN) modules to conduct image regularizations. The MoraNet was trained on retrospectively acquired lung MRI images for both fully sampled and undersampled acquisitions. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on digital CT/MRI breathing XCAT (CoMBAT) phantom data, QUASAR motion phantom data acquired from a 1.0T MRI scanner and volunteer chest data acquired from a 1.5T MRI scanner. The MoraNet pipeline was compared with motion-averaged reconstruction and a conventional compressed sensing (CS)-based method in terms of SSIM, RMSE and computation time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed network could provide accurate respiratory signal estimation and enable effective motion correction. Compared with the CS method, the MoraNet preserved better structural details with lower RMSE and higher SSIM values at acceleration factor of 4, and meanwhile took ten-fold faster inference time.</p>
