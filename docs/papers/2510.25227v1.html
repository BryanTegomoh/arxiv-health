                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research introduces a novel Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) framework for medical image segmentation, designed to overcome challenges of sample difficulty and noisy supervision under domain shift, particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive medical data. The framework employs progressive adaptation through hard sample selection, denoised pseudo-label refinement, and patch mixing to align target distributions. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating improved boundary delineation and robust segmentation across benchmark datasets.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>SFDA is crucial for deploying AI in healthcare as it allows models trained on sensitive, private medical datasets to be adapted to new clinical sites or imaging devices without direct access to the source data, thereby preserving patient privacy and intellectual property. Robust segmentation under domain shift ensures that AI models perform reliably across the varied imaging protocols, scanner types, and patient populations found in real-world clinical environments.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides an AI application in the form of an improved machine learning framework (SFDA) for automated medical image segmentation. It enables AI models to accurately delineate anatomical structures or pathologies (e.g., tumors, organs, lesions) in medical scans (like MRI, CT, X-ray) even when the model is applied to data from different hospitals or scanners (domain shift) without access to the original training data (source-free), and under privacy constraints. This advancement can lead to more robust AI tools for diagnosis, treatment planning, monitoring disease progression, and supporting clinical decision-making in various medical specialties.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The framework operates in three main stages: First, unlabeled target images are categorized into reliable ('easy') and unreliable ('hard') subsets using entropy-similarity analysis. Second, pseudo-labels generated for these images are refined by applying Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, which identify and suppress noisy or unreliable pixels. Third, a Denoised Patch Mixing strategy is employed, utilizing both intra- and inter-domain objectives to mix patches between the reliable and unreliable subsets, facilitating the transfer of robust semantic information while actively mitigating the impact of noise from the unreliable regions.</p>

                <p>This research could significantly enhance the deployability and reliability of AI-powered medical image segmentation tools in diverse clinical settings. By enabling models trained on private data to adapt to new hospital systems or equipment without sharing sensitive patient information, it addresses a major privacy barrier. Furthermore, the improved robustness to domain shift means that AI models can maintain high accuracy even with variations in image acquisition, reducing the need for extensive manual recalibration or re-annotation and potentially leading to more consistent and efficient clinical workflows for tasks like tumor segmentation or organ delineation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.</p>
