                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a brain-inspired model designed to enhance machine understanding of intuitive physics by mirroring human cognitive processes. SRNN employs a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, using Hebbian learning across 'What' and 'How' pathways to generate structured linguistic scene descriptions. The model achieves competitive performance on the CLEVRER benchmark while also revealing benchmark biases and demonstrating white-box utility for error diagnosis, confirming the feasibility of translating biological intelligence to AI for physical reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge
this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational
principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network
(SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object
attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian
``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and
\textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate
structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and
language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent
``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune''
approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our
analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic
evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error
diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological
intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.</p>
