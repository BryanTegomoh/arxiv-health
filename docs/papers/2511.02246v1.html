                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an infrastructure to automatically generate realistic medical queries and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for biases, hallucinations, and omissions, particularly concerning demographic information. The study reveals that LLM-based evaluators show alarmingly low inter-rater agreement (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and statistically significant results on LLM biases are often contingent on specific LLM pairings, potentially leading to non-generalizable conclusions without robust evaluation practices.</p>

                    <p>The study developed a two-pronged infrastructure: (1) an automated query creation pipeline to generate diverse and realistic medical questions by sampling patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles; and (2) an evaluation pipeline that uses multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts to detect hallucinations, omissions, and classify treatment categories, leveraging agentic workflows. Baseline case studies included analyzing inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying both the answering and evaluation LLMs.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings indicate exceptionally low inter-LLM annotator agreement, with an average Cohen's Kappa of $\kappa=0.118$, signifying poor consistency when LLMs act as evaluators. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in LLM performance across demographic biases (e.g., writing styles, genders, races) were found to be specific to particular (answering LLM, evaluation LLM) pairs, questioning the generalizability of such results.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings have a significant clinical impact by warning against over-reliance on single-LLM evaluation for medical chatbots. They strongly suggest that without robust multi-LLM evaluation and transparent reporting of agreement metrics, medical AI tools might deliver inconsistent, biased, or non-generalizable advice, compromising patient safety and trust. This necessitates a more rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation approach before LLMs can be confidently integrated into clinical workflows for diverse patient populations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:
