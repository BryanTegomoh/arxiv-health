                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents an automated 3D U-Net model, trained via the nnU-Net framework, for real-time segmentation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) from intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) volumes. The model, particularly when trained on cropped regions around tumors, significantly outperforms a full-volume approach, achieving clinically acceptable accuracy (median DSC=0.74, HDist=17.1mm) approximately four times faster (~1 minute) than semi-automatic methods. This technology aims to enhance precision and efficiency in ultrasound-based surgical navigation for hepatic resections.</p>

Segmentation accuracy was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) on both retrospective and prospective datasets. The entire workflow was integrated into 3D Slicer to facilitate real-time intraoperative application and testing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.</p>
