                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for developing personalized and highly effective non-invasive treatments for the widespread global problem of sleep disorders.

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper's focus on 'closed-loop modulation systems' with components like 'monitoring model design' and 'modulation strategy design' strongly implies the application of AI. An AI-powered 'monitoring model' would analyze real-time physiological data (e.g., EEG, heart rate) from sensors to accurately detect sleep stages, identify sleep disturbances, or predict optimal moments for intervention. The 'modulation strategy design' would then leverage AI/machine learning algorithms to adaptively and precisely control the non-invasive brain stimulation parameters (e.g., intensity, duration, frequency) in real-time, based on the monitoring data, to optimize sleep enhancement for individual users. This enables personalized and intelligent interventions, moving beyond fixed, open-loop parameters.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems.</p>
