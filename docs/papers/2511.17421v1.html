                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical issue of shortcut learning in deep learning models for medical image analysis, where models may use irrelevant features leading to poor robustness and potential harm. The authors propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a specialist teacher network (fine-tuned on a small, task-relevant dataset) to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large, biased dataset. Their approach, which targets intermediate network layers, consistently outperforms traditional bias mitigation methods and achieves performance comparable to models trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes an Intermediate Layer Knowledge Distillation (ILKD) framework. This involves training a 'specialist teacher' network on a small, carefully curated subset of task-relevant (bias-free) data. This teacher then distills its knowledge to a 'student network' which is trained on a large dataset known to be corrupted with a bias feature. The distillation process specifically targets and leverages signals from intermediate layers of the networks to address different manifestations of shortcut learning. The approach was evaluated using various CNN architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, 3D CNNs) across CheXpert (chest X-rays), ISIC 2017 (skin lesions), and SimBA datasets, comparing against traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), augmentation-based, and group-based bias mitigation strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The key findings indicate that shortcut features manifest distinctly across different network layers, allowing for targeted mitigation. The proposed intermediate layer knowledge distillation framework consistently and significantly improves model robustness by mitigating shortcut learning across various datasets and architectures. It achieved performance comparable to models trained on bias-free data, notably even on out-of-distribution test sets. Crucially, the method demonstrates practical utility in scenarios where explicit bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are not easily identifiable.</p>

                <p>This work has significant clinical impact by enabling the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI systems for medical diagnosis and analysis. By ensuring models focus on genuine clinical features rather than irrelevant biases (e.g., hospital stamps, image artifacts, demographic proxies), it can lead to more accurate diagnoses, reduced diagnostic errors, and improved patient outcomes. Its applicability in real-world scenarios with limited bias annotations makes it highly practical for deploying AI in diverse healthcare settings, enhancing patient safety and clinician confidence in AI-assisted tools.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.</p>
