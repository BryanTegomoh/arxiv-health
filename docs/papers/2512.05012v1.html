                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method designed to improve the factuality and transparency of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. CER fine-tunes embeddings using contrastive learning with subjectivity-based hard negative selection and generates token-level attribution rationales, creating an embedding space aligned with evidential reasoning. Evaluated on clinical trial reports, CER demonstrates improved retrieval accuracy, mitigates hallucinations, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval essential for safety-critical domains.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method directly addresses critical challenges in medical AI, particularly the need for verifiable factual information and prevention of 'hallucinations' in safety-critical applications. By ensuring that information extracted from clinical trials and other medical data is accurate, transparent, and evidence-based, CER can significantly improve the trustworthiness and utility of AI in clinical decision support and medical research.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research contributes to creating more factual, transparent, and reliable AI systems (specifically Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG) for processing and extracting information from complex medical documents like clinical trial reports. This can be used to support medical professionals in accessing accurate, evidence-based information, improving diagnostic support, treatment planning, drug discovery, and regulatory compliance by reducing the risk of AI-generated misinformation (hallucinations) in safety-critical medical contexts.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>CER employs contrastive learning to fine-tune embeddings, explicitly aligning them with evidential reasoning. A core component is the automatic selection of 'hard negatives' based on a subjectivity-based criterion, which forces the model to differentiate between factual rationales and subjective or misleading explanations. Simultaneously, the method generates token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage, providing granular insights into why certain evidence is considered relevant.</p>

                <p>CER has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice and medical research by enhancing the reliability of AI-powered information retrieval from complex medical literature, such as clinical trial reports. This can lead to more accurate clinical decision-making, safer drug development processes, improved patient safety through better access to factual evidence, and more trustworthy insights for medical research, especially where factual accuracy is paramount.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This extended abstract introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method that restructures retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings with contrastive learning and generating token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage. Hard negatives are automatically selected using a subjectivity-based criterion, forcing the model to pull factual rationales closer while pushing subjective or misleading explanations apart. As a result, the method creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning. We evaluated our method on clinical trial reports, and initial experimental results show that CER improves retrieval accuracy, mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval that enhances reliability, especially in safety-critical domains.</p>
