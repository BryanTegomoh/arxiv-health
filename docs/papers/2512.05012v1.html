                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that enhances factuality and transparency. CER fine-unes embeddings with contrastive learning and generates token-level attribution rationales, explicitly aligning retrieval with evidential reasoning. Evaluated on clinical trial reports, the method demonstrates improved retrieval accuracy, mitigates hallucinations, and provides transparent, reliable evidence-based retrieval critical for safety-critical domains.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is highly relevant to medicine by improving the trustworthiness and safety of AI systems, such as RAG, when processing critical medical information like clinical trial data. By reducing 'hallucinations' (incorrect or fabricated information) and ensuring transparent, evidence-based retrieval, it directly supports more accurate and reliable decision-making in healthcare, a domain where errors can have severe consequences.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI method (Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-ranking - CER) is designed to improve the reliability, factuality, and transparency of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. In a health context, this means RAG systems applied to medical literature (like clinical trial reports) can provide more accurate, evidence-backed, and auditable information. This is crucial for applications such as assisting medical researchers, supporting clinical decision-making, extracting insights for drug discovery, and generating trustworthy health information, by reducing the risk of misinformation (hallucinations) and increasing the explainability of the AI's output.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER) method restructures retrieval by fine-tuning embeddings using contrastive learning. It generates token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage, indicating the factual evidence. Hard negatives are automatically selected based on a subjectivity-based criterion, which then forces the model during training to pull factual rationales closer together in the embedding space while pushing subjective or misleading explanations further apart. This process creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Initial experimental results from evaluation on clinical trial reports demonstrate that CER improves retrieval accuracy. Crucially, it mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems, providing transparent and evidence-based retrieval. This significantly enhances the reliability of RAG systems, particularly in safety-critical domains.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>CER has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by making AI-powered information retrieval more reliable and trustworthy. In clinical settings, where RAG systems might be used to summarize patient records, synthesize evidence for treatment guidelines, or interpret clinical trial results, CER's ability to prevent hallucinations and provide transparent, evidence-based rationales can directly lead to safer and more informed clinical decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing medical errors.</p>

                <p class="abstract">This extended abstract introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method that restructures retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings with contrastive learning and generating token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage.
