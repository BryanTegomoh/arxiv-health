                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER) restructures retrieval by fine-tuning contextual embeddings using contrastive learning. The core mechanism involves automatically selecting hard negative examples based on a subjectivity-based criterion. This process forces the model to learn an embedding space where factual and evidential rationales are semantically proximate, while subjective or misleading explanations are pushed further apart. Additionally, CER generates token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage, offering granular transparency into why specific evidence is deemed relevant.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>CER's ability to ensure factual accuracy, provide transparent rationales, and reduce AI hallucinations has profound implications for clinical practice and medical research. It can significantly enhance the reliability of AI systems used in tasks such as synthesizing information from vast clinical trial literature for treatment guidelines, drug safety analysis, or personalized medicine, where the consequences of misinformation are severe. This increased trustworthiness facilitates broader adoption of AI in safety-critical medical applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This extended abstract introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method that restructures retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings with contrastive learning and generating token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage. Hard negatives are automatically selected using a subjectivity-based criterion, forcing the model to pull factual rationales closer while pushing subjective or misleading explanations apart. As a result, the method creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning. We evaluated our method on clinical trial reports, and initial experimental results show that CER improves retrieval accuracy, mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval that enhances reliability, especially in safety-critical domains.</p>
