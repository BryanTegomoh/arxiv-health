                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems designed to enhance factuality and transparency. CER fine-tunes embeddings with contrastive learning and generates token-level attribution rationales, using subjectivity-based hard negative selection to align the embedding space with evidential reasoning. Evaluated on clinical trial reports, CER demonstrates improved retrieval accuracy, mitigates hallucinations, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval crucial for safety-critical domains.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER) method involves fine-tuning retrieval embeddings using contrastive learning. It automatically selects hard negative examples based on a subjectivity-based criterion. This process aims to increase the semantic distance between factual rationales and subjective/misleading explanations in the embedding space. Additionally, CER generates token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage, providing explicit transparency for the evidence presented.</p>

It successfully mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems and offers transparent, evidence-based retrieval. These improvements lead to enhanced reliability, which is particularly vital for applications within safety-critical domains.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This extended abstract introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method that restructures retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings with contrastive learning and generating token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage. Hard negatives are automatically selected using a subjectivity-based criterion, forcing the model to pull factual rationales closer while pushing subjective or misleading explanations apart. As a result, the method creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning. We evaluated our method on clinical trial reports, and initial experimental results show that CER improves retrieval accuracy, mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval that enhances reliability, especially in safety-critical domains.</p>
