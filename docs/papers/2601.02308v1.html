                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This scoping review analyzed 36 mathematical models of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) published between 2019 and 2024, revealing a predominance of deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models focused on bacterial resistance in human hosts. The paper highlights significant methodological limitations, a lack of holistic One Health perspectives, and geographic biases within the current AMR modeling landscape.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding the complex dynamics of AMR through robust mathematical models is crucial for predicting its spread, evaluating intervention strategies, and informing evidence-based public health policies to mitigate a major global health crisis responsible for millions of deaths and substantial economic burden.</p>

                <p>Not directly applicable. The paper focuses on traditional mathematical models (e.g., Ordinary Differential Equations) for studying AMR. While the insights from these models could inform the development of AI-driven predictive tools or decision support systems in healthcare for AMR management, the paper itself does not discuss AI applications.</p>

                    <p>A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted, searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for mathematical models of AMR published between 2019 and 2024.

                    <p>The review found that most AMR mathematical models predominantly utilize deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODE) and focus on bacterial resistance within human hosts. While conjugation and mutation are frequently modeled, crucial elements such as transduction, transformation, host immunity, spatial heterogeneity, environmental components, and economic impacts are largely omitted. There is a strong geographic bias toward high-income countries and a notable absence of comprehensive One Health perspectives.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Improved and more diverse mathematical models, incorporating neglected factors like host immunity, spatial dynamics, environmental reservoirs, and economic considerations, can directly inform the development of more effective clinical guidelines for antibiotic stewardship, public health interventions for infection control, and resource allocation strategies to combat AMR at local and global scales.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The field of AMR mathematical modeling currently suffers from limited methodological diversity, an over-reliance on deterministic ODE models, narrow focus on bacterial resistance in human hosts, and a significant underrepresentation of critical factors such as host immunity, spatial dynamics, environmental interactions, and economic impacts. Additionally, a strong geographic bias limits the global applicability of existing research.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should integrate stochasticity, spatial structure, and ecological interactions into models. Furthermore, there is a critical need to adopt a One Health perspective, incorporate host immunity and environmental components, and include economic and social variables to develop more holistic and globally relevant strategies for AMR mitigation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health problem, contributing to an estimated 4.95 million deaths in 2019 and projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually and 100 trillion dollars in cumulative economic losses by 2050. Its emergence and spread result from complex biological, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions. Mathematical modelling is a key tool to study AMR dynamics, yet the literature remains fragmented and methodologically limited. This review synthesizes recent mathematical modelling studies to identify trends, biases, and research gaps. Methods: A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published between 2019 and 2024 that developed mathematical models of AMR. After screening and duplicate removal, 36 studies were included. Data were extracted using a structured framework covering model context, construction and parameters, and outputs and validation. Results: Most studies relied on deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and focused on bacterial resistance in human hosts, with only one adopting a One Health perspective. Conjugation and mutation were the most commonly modelled resistance mechanisms, whereas transduction, transformation, host immunity, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental components were rarely included. Few studies incorporated economic impacts, and a strong geographic bias toward high-income countries was observed. Conclusion: Mathematical modelling of AMR is an active field but characterized by limited methodological diversity. While deterministic ODE models have advanced understanding of AMR dynamics, future work should integrate stochasticity, spatial structure, ecological interactions, and One Health perspectives, as well as economic and social variables, to inform global strategies to mitigate AMR.</p>
