                    <p>The study employs a radiomics-based pipeline that addresses data scarcity by generating training labels through pseudo-labeling, obviating the need for expert-defined segmentations. Image features are extracted using two distinct approaches: traditional radiomics feature extraction and deep learning features derived from pre-trained foundation models (CT-FM, RadImageNet). These features are then utilized with traditional classifiers to classify non-contrast CCTA scans into zero versus non-zero calcium score groups. The methodology was evaluated on a clinical dataset of 182 patients and included an investigation into the impact of training data composition.</p>

                <p>This framework offers a practical and scalable solution for automated coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment, particularly in clinical settings where expert annotation resources are limited.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.</p>
