                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a 'Probabilistic Textual Time Series Depression Detection' (PTTSD) framework. It utilizes advanced AI techniques (bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections) to analyze textual data from patient-clinician interviews. The goal is to probabilistically predict depression severity, measured by PHQ-8 scores, over time, providing uncertainty estimates that are valuable for clinical decision-making and supporting mental health professionals in diagnosis and monitoring.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>PTTSD is a deep learning framework that processes utterance-level clinical interview text. It comprises sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, built upon bidirectional LSTMs for sequential context, self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, and residual connections. The framework distinguishes itself by using probabilistic output heads (Gaussian or Student-t distributions) trained via negative log-likelihood, allowing it to predict not just a score but also its uncertainty as prediction intervals. Evaluation was conducted on the E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ datasets, employing ablation studies to validate architectural components and comparisons with MentalBERT to demonstrate generalizability.</p>

                    <p>The PTTSD framework achieved state-of-the-art performance among text-only depression detection systems, evidenced by MAE scores of 3.85 on E-DAIC and 3.55 on DAIC-WOZ. Crucially, it demonstrated the ability to produce well-calibrated prediction intervals, effectively quantifying uncertainty in its predictions. Ablation studies confirmed the significant contributions of attention mechanisms and the probabilistic modeling aspect.

                <p>This framework offers a significant advancement for clinical practice by providing objective and interpretable assessments of depression severity from patient interviews, coupled with crucial uncertainty estimates. Clinicians can leverage these well-calibrated prediction intervals to gauge the confidence of a severity score, potentially guiding more personalized and timely interventions, facilitating early detection of worsening symptoms, and improving the overall robustness of clinical decision-making in mental healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.</p>
