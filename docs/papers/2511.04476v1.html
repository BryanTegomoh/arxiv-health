                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>PTTSD is a deep learning framework offered in sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants. It processes utterance-level clinical interview text using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal context, augmented with self-attention mechanisms for weighting important linguistic features and residual connections for stable training. The core innovation lies in its probabilistic output heads (Gaussian or Student-t distributions), which predict both the mean and variance of PHQ-8 scores, trained via negative log-likelihood to enable robust uncertainty quantification over time.</p>

It successfully produces well-calibrated prediction intervals, directly addressing the need for uncertainty quantification in clinical predictions. Ablation studies confirmed the essential contributions of both self-attention and the probabilistic modeling approach, validating these design choices for improved accuracy and reliability.</p>

By providing well-calibrated prediction intervals alongside severity scores, PTTSD can aid clinicians in making more informed decisions regarding patient assessment, treatment monitoring, and risk stratification. The ability to track changes and quantify confidence over time from interview text supports more personalized and evidence-based mental healthcare interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.</p>
