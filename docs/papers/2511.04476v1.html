                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>PTTSD is a deep learning framework implemented in sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants. It processes utterance-level textual data using bidirectional LSTMs, incorporates self-attention for capturing contextual dependencies, and employs residual connections for enhanced training stability. The model's output layer utilizes Gaussian or Student-t distributions, trained via negative log-likelihood, to predict PHQ-8 scores along with associated uncertainty. Evaluation involved standard metrics (e.g., MAE) on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ datasets, complemented by ablation studies and a three-part calibration analysis.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>PTTSD demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for text-only depression detection, achieving MAEs of 3.85 on E-DAIC and 3.55 on DAIC-WOZ. A key finding is its ability to generate well-calibrated prediction intervals, signifying reliable uncertainty estimates. Ablation studies rigorously confirmed the critical contributions of both attention mechanisms and the probabilistic modeling approach to the overall effectiveness and utility of the framework.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>PTTSD offers a significant clinical impact by moving beyond point predictions to provide a complete probabilistic understanding of depression severity. This allows clinicians to assess the certainty of a diagnosis, identify ambiguous cases that require closer scrutiny, or prioritize patients based on the model's confidence. The interpretable uncertainty estimates facilitate more transparent clinical communication, support personalized treatment adjustments, and empower more confident clinical decision-making, ultimately leading to improved patient management and outcomes in mental health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.</p>
