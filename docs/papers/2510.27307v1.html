                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel fragile zero-watermarking method designed to protect medical images from copyright infringement and content tampering.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote
consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and
sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content
tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an
effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology
focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by
extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting
medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model
based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational
relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to
correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates
zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion
matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content
tampering detection for medical images.</p>
