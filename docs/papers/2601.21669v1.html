                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper identifies outcome-level mode collapse in reinforcement learning (RL), where policies converge to a narrow subset of high-quality solutions, as a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself, rather than solely exploration issues. It proposes Inverse Probability Scaling (IPS) as a minimal correction that fundamentally alters learning dynamics to yield reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse, and demonstrates its effectiveness in tasks including molecular generation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>For medical applications, particularly in drug discovery and personalized medicine, the ability of AI to reliably generate a diverse set of high-quality solutions (e.g., novel drug candidates with varied scaffolds, multiple individualized treatment plan options) is critical. This work provides a fundamental algorithmic solution to a significant limitation of current RL, enabling AI to propose a broader, more robust range of options for complex medical problems.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a theoretical analysis of existing reinforcement learning objective functions to diagnose the structural cause of mode collapse. Based on this diagnosis, a novel algorithmic correction, Inverse Probability Scaling (IPS), is proposed and mathematically derived to provably achieve reward-proportional terminal distributions. This principle is then instantiated as a practical, drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, to an existing policy optimization algorithm and empirically validated on various tasks, including molecular generation, to assess its performance in reducing mode collapse and maintaining overall reward.</p>

                    <p>The primary key finding is that the expected-return objective in standard RL inherently leads to outcome-level mode collapse due to its structural properties. The paper's main contribution is the development of Inverse Probability Scaling (IPS), which fundamentally rectifies this issue by ensuring learned policies yield terminal distributions that are proportional to their rewards, thus preventing collapse and promoting solution diversity. IPS-GRPO demonstrated superior performance in achieving diversity without compromising reward on relevant tasks.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential to significantly enhance AI's capabilities in designing novel therapeutics by enabling the generation of a diverse array of potential drug candidates, each with distinct chemical properties but comparable efficacy, thereby increasing the chances of finding viable and optimized treatments. It could also empower AI systems to propose multiple, equally valid, yet distinct treatment strategies for individual patients, allowing clinicians to make more nuanced and personalized decisions considering patient-specific preferences, comorbidities, and potential side effects.</p>

This suggests directions such as extending Inverse Probability Scaling to other RL paradigms (e.g., off-policy learning, multi-agent systems), investigating its computational efficiency and scalability in real-world medical applications, and applying it to a broader spectrum of complex medical RL problems beyond molecular generation, such as optimizing intricate clinical pathways or diagnostic workflows.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.</p>
