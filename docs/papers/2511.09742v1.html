                    <p>The study performed a comparative evaluation of vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain Foundation Models on chest X-ray data. Benchmarking involved two classification tasks (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and two segmentation tasks (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary). Performance was assessed using both linear probing (to gauge initial feature quality) and fine-tuning. Subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate shortcut learning strategies employed by FMs.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Medical domain-specific pre-training confers a significant advantage in initial feature quality. However, FM feature utility is highly task-dependent, performing well for global classification and salient anatomy segmentation, but poorly for subtle pathology segmentation without substantial fine-tuning. FMs demonstrate a tendency to use confounding shortcuts for classification that fail for precise segmentation. Notably, image-only and label-supervised FMs can achieve top performance, and a supervised end-to-end baseline proved highly competitive, particularly for segmentation tasks.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>These findings directly inform the clinical adoption and development of AI in radiology. They suggest that FMs, while promising, should be approached with caution for tasks requiring precise localization of subtle pathologies. Clinicians and developers must understand that 'off-the-shelf' FM embeddings may not suffice for all diagnostic challenges and that task-specific fine-tuning or robust supervised models remain critical for sensitive clinical applications, particularly where shortcut learning could lead to misdiagnosis.</p>

                <p>The study reveals critical limitations inherent to current Foundation Models for medical imaging, specifically their poor performance in segmenting complex, subtle pathologies without significant fine-tuning, and their reliance on confounding shortcuts for classification. This indicates a gap in their ability to robustly localize subtle disease features for precise clinical utility.</p>

                <p>Future research should focus on developing FM architectures that are specifically designed to improve localization of subtle and complex pathologies, potentially through multi-scale feature learning or pre-training strategies less prone to shortcut learning. Further investigation into optimal pre-training paradigms beyond text-image alignment is also warranted, given the strong performance of image-only and label-supervised models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.</p>
