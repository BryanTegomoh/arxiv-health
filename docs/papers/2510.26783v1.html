                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a unified theory for causal inference, specifically focusing on Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation, by integrating various statistical methodologies such as Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and matching estimators. It highlights the critical role of balancing weights (also known as Riesz representers or clever covariates) and establishes key equivalences and dual relationships among these diverse techniques, providing a cohesive framework for causal inference.</p>

                    <p>The paper employs a theoretical synthesis approach, systematically integrating existing causal inference methodologies (Riesz regression, covariate balancing, DRE, TMLE, matching estimators) by demonstrating their underlying connections, equivalences, and dual relationships within the specific context of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.</p>
