                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a unified theoretical framework for causal inference, specifically for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation, by integrating diverse methodologies such as Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and matching estimators. The theory highlights the central role of 'balancing weights,' also known as Riesz representers or clever covariates, in bridging these seemingly distinct approaches and delineating their interrelationships and equivalences.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Causal inference is fundamental in medicine for evaluating the true impact of treatments, interventions, and risk factors from observational data, which are prevalent in clinical and epidemiological research. This unified framework can lead to more robust, interpretable, and methodologically sound analyses, thereby strengthening evidence-based medicine and informing clinical guidelines and health policies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research can significantly enhance medical AI applications by providing more robust and debiased methods for causal inference. AI systems in healthcare often aim to predict outcomes or recommend interventions; however, understanding the *causal* impact of these interventions is crucial for clinical utility and safety. This paper's techniques can lead to AI systems that more accurately estimate treatment effects, identify causal risk factors, mitigate bias in observational studies, and support evidence-based decision-making in personalized medicine or clinical decision support tools. It helps build trustworthy AI by ensuring that learned relationships are truly causal, not just correlational.</p>

                    <p>The paper presents a theoretical and conceptual framework, primarily focused on mathematical integration and demonstrating equivalences between various causal inference methodologies.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The central finding is the development of a unified theoretical framework that demonstrates deep conceptual and mathematical equivalences among seemingly disparate causal inference methods. Specifically, Riesz regression is shown to be equivalent to DRE, matching is a special case of DRE, DRE and covariate balancing exhibit a dual relationship, and Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression. This unification clarifies the role of balancing weights as a foundational element across these methods.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This unified theory can lead to more informed choices of causal inference methods by medical researchers, potentially improving the reliability and interpretability of findings from observational studies. By understanding the underlying equivalences, researchers can select or combine methods more effectively, leading to stronger evidence for treatment efficacy, risk factor identification, and health policy decisions, ultimately enhancing patient care and population health outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.</p>
