                    <p>The researchers developed AngioAI-QFR, an end-to-end angiography-only pipeline. It utilizes deep learning for automated stenosis detection and accurate lumen segmentation, followed by centreline and diameter extraction. The system then computes per-millimetre Relative Flow Capacity (RFC) profiles and angiography-derived Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR). A virtual stenting module allows for simulated stent placement with automatic recomputation of QFR. The pipeline was validated in 100 consecutive vessels against invasive wire-based FFR as the gold standard, assessing correlation, mean absolute error, and diagnostic performance.</p>

                    <p>Deep learning models achieved high precision (0.97) for stenosis detection and Dice coefficient (0.78) for lumen segmentation. AngioAI-QFR demonstrated strong agreement with invasive FFR (r = 0.89, MAE = 0.045) across 100 vessels. Its diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80 was excellent (AUC 0.93, sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.86). The pipeline operated mostly automatically (93% of vessels) with a rapid median result time of 41 seconds. RFC profiling successfully differentiated focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting accurately predicted larger QFR gains in focal lesions, aiding treatment strategy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Coronary angiography is the main tool for assessing coronary artery disease, but visual grading of stenosis is variable and only moderately related to ischaemia. Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal than in diffuse disease. AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography derived physiology.</p>
