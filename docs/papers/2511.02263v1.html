                    <p>LA-MARRVEL functions as a post-processing reranking layer for AI-MARRVEL. It incorporates expert-engineered contextual information and iteratively queries a large language model (LLM).

The system showed particularly strong performance gains in cases where the initial AI-MARRVEL ranking of the causal gene was low. Additionally, LA-MARRVEL provides LLM-generated reasoning that integrates phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence for each ranked gene, enhancing interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Diagnosing rare diseases often requires connecting variant-bearing genes to
evidence that is written as unstructured clinical prose, which the current
established pipelines still leave for clinicians to reconcile manually. To this
end, we introduce LA-MARRVEL, a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking
layer that operates on top of AI-MARRVEL: it supplies expert-engineered
context, queries a large language model multiple times, and aggregates the
resulting partial rankings with a ranked voting method to produce a stable,
explainable gene ranking. Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN),
LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established
phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large
gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each
ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates
phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output
more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.</p>
