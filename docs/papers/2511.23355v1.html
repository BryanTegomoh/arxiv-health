                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel computer vision-based pipeline designed to automatically capture and digitize physiological data from standalone bedside monitor screens, specifically targeting low-resource healthcare settings lacking network connectivity. By employing a hierarchical framework with YOLOv11 for object detection, PaddleOCR for text extraction, and geometric rectification, the system reliably transforms unstructured screen information into structured digital data. It achieved an end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeding 98.9% for core vital signs, offering a practical solution to integrate legacy monitor data into EHR systems.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involves a hierarchical computer vision pipeline. It begins with YOLOv11 for object detection to accurately localize the bedside monitor and specific vital sign Regions of Interest (ROIs) on its screen. A geometric rectification module is then applied to standardize the perspective of the detected screen, compensating for varying camera angles and lighting. Finally, PaddleOCR is used to perform robust optical character recognition (OCR) on the rectified ROIs to extract and digitize the physiological parameter values.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.</p>
