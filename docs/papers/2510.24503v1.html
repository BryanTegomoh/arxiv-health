                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study addresses the critical trade-off in Federated Learning (FL) between optimizing for local model performance (as in Personalized Federated Learning, PFL) and ensuring robust out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The authors propose and evaluate Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), a modified FedAvg, empirically comparing various FL approaches on both metrics across diverse data heterogeneity levels to achieve a nuanced understanding of their capabilities.</p>

                    <li>**Problem Highlighted:** Existing Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) approaches primarily focus on optimizing local model performance, often neglecting crucial out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, which is a significant component of robustness.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Client Drift Addressed:** The research acknowledges 'client drift' in standard FL (e.g., FedAvg) due to heterogeneous data, where local models diverge from the global optimum, leading to suboptimal updates.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:** The study introduces a thorough evaluation methodology that assesses FL approaches not only on average local performance but also on their generalization capabilities to OOD samples, examining metrics at different stages within a communication round for nuanced understanding.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Novel Algorithm Proposed:** Introduction of Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), an extension of FedAvg incorporating a straightforward individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor.</li>

It seeks to highlight that while PFL methods may achieve high local performance, they often compromise OOD generalization.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.</p>
