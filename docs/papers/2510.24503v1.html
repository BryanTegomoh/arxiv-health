                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical trade-off in Federated Learning between optimizing local model performance and ensuring out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, especially in heterogeneous data environments. It proposes Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), an extension of FedAvg featuring an adaptive personalization factor, and thoroughly evaluates various FL approaches on both local performance and OOD generalization across diverse data heterogeneity levels. The study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of FL model behavior by examining performance at different stages within communication rounds.</p>

                    <p>The study conducts an empirical analysis comparing standard Federated Learning (FedAvg), Personalized Federated Learning approaches, and the proposed Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU). FLIU extends FedAvg by incorporating an individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor. Evaluations are performed on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under controlled conditions of data heterogeneity, including IID, pathological non-IID, and novel Dirichlet distribution setups. The assessment focuses on both local model performance and out-of-distribution generalization, with a detailed examination across different stages within communication rounds.</p>

                    <p>The study aims to demonstrate that while personalized FL methods can improve local performance, they often do so at the expense of OOD generalization. It is expected to show that FedAvg provides better OOD generalization but may suffer from client drift and suboptimal local performance in heterogeneous environments. The proposed FLIU is hypothesized to achieve a superior balance, offering competitive local performance while significantly enhancing or preserving OOD generalization, particularly in highly heterogeneous data settings simulated by Dirichlet distributions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.</p>
