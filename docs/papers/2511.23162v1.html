                    <p>The authors developed EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder architecture. This deep learning model processes an arbitrary number of EEG trials to output an estimated ERP.

The method was validated for its zero-shot generalization capabilities on new subjects using a diverse set of publicly available EEG datasets.</p>

It could enable more frequent assessments, facilitate research in vulnerable populations (e.g., children, elderly, cognitively impaired individuals) who cannot tolerate long recording sessions, and accelerate the discovery and validation of new ERP biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.
