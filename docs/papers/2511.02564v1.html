                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The MTF-CVReID framework builds upon a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) backbone, integrating seven specialized, parameter-efficient modules. These modules collectively address challenges such as camera/view biases (CSFN), scale variations (MRFH), identity persistence (IAMM), short-term motion dynamics (TDM), perspective alignment (IVFA), multi-scale temporal patterns (HTPL), and cross-view identity coherence through contrastive learning (MVICL). The system's performance and efficiency were rigorously evaluated on standard benchmarks like AG-VPReID, G2A-VReID, and MARS.</p>

                    <p>The paper demonstrates that MTF-CVReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels, significantly outperforming previous methods. It exhibits strong generalization capabilities to other datasets (G2A-VReID, MARS) and maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) despite the added complexity of the seven modules.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to robustly and efficiently re-identify individuals across various viewpoints and time in complex environments could have a transformative impact on patient safety and operational efficiency in healthcare. This includes real-time tracking of vulnerable patients (e.g., those with dementia, psychiatric conditions, or at risk of falls) across hospital wards, securing restricted areas by identifying unauthorized personnel, and optimizing clinical workflows by tracking staff or equipment in large facilities, all while ensuring scalability for real-world deployment.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the abstract highlights strong performance and generalization, it does not explicitly detail limitations. Potential implicit limitations of such a system in a clinical context could include: sensitivity to extreme occlusions or changes in patient attire (e.g., specific gowns), ethical and privacy concerns regarding continuous surveillance, performance variations under diverse clinical lighting conditions, and the need for rigorous validation in real-world hospital environments which often present unique challenges not fully captured by public datasets (e.g., highly diverse patient demographics, varying mobility levels).</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research could explore integrating MTF-CVReID with privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., differential privacy, federated learning) to facilitate ethical deployment in healthcare. Further investigation into its performance under extreme occlusion scenarios specific to clinical settings, such as crowded emergency rooms, or extending its capabilities to include multi-modal data (e.g., physiological sensors) for enhanced patient monitoring, could also be valuable. Finally, real-world pilot implementations and longitudinal studies in actual healthcare facilities are crucial for validating its practical utility and impact.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at
