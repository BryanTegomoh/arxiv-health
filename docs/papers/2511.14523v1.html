                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a comprehensive, reproducible case study demonstrating an end-to-end workflow for teaching and applying linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to longitudinal data. Using a mouse body-weight growth experiment, it illustrates data preparation, sequential model building and selection (common-slope, fully interacted, parsimonious models), diagnostics, and interpretation via linear contrasts. The study highlights that a parsimonious LMM can effectively reveal distinct group-specific growth trajectories, outperforming simpler models and fitting as well as more complex ones.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study reanalyzed a published dataset from a 12-week mouse body-weight experiment (31 mice, 3 groups, weekly measurements). The data was first reshaped into a long format, followed by exploratory profile plots to visually motivate linear time trends. Three random-intercept linear mixed models were fitted: a common-slope model, a fully interacted group-by-time model, and a parsimonious model featuring group-specific intercepts, a shared slope for two groups, and an extra slope for the third. Model comparison and selection were performed using maximum likelihood estimation, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and likelihood ratio tests. Linear contrasts were then applied to estimate and test specific group differences in weekly mean body weights and total 12-week weight gains. The methodology is presented with R code and a stepwise checklist for reproducibility.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The parsimonious linear mixed model provided the best fit, significantly outperforming the simpler common-slope model and performing as well as the more complex fully interacted model. This optimal model distinctly revealed that two mouse groups exhibited small and similar weight gains, while the third group experienced much steeper growth. Linear contrasts confirmed these observations, demonstrating highly significant differences in excess weight gain for the third group. The study successfully established a complete, executable, and reproducible workflow for longitudinal linear mixed modeling.</p>

                <p>The paper's provided end-to-end workflow serves as a valuable educational and practical template for medical and health professionals. It enables researchers to accurately apply advanced statistical methods to longitudinal data, thereby improving the design, analysis, and interpretation of studies related to disease progression, treatment efficacy, and growth trajectories. This enhanced analytical capability will foster more reliable evidence for clinical decision-making, drug development, and public health interventions, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery and translational research.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state any limitations of the presented teaching case study or its methodology. It focuses on demonstrating a robust and comprehensive workflow. Implicitly, like any model, the LMM assumes a certain data structure (e.g., linear trends as motivated by profile plots) which might not always generalize without further modeling considerations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Linear mixed-effects models are central for analyzing longitudinal continuous data, yet many learners meet them as scattered formulas or software output rather than as a coherent workflow. There is a need for a single, reproducible case study that links questions, model building, diagnostics, and interpretation.
  Methods: We reanalyze a published mouse body-weight experiment with 31 mice in three groups weighed weekly for 12 weeks. After reshaping the data to long format and using profile plots to motivate linear time trends, we fit three random-intercept linear mixed models: a common-slope model, a fully interacted group-by-time model, and a parsimonious model with group-specific intercepts, a shared slope for two groups, and an extra slope for the third. Models are compared using maximum likelihood, AIC, BIC, and likelihood ratio tests, and linear contrasts are used to estimate group differences in weekly means and 12 week gains.
  Results: The parsimonious model fits as well as the fully interacted model and clearly outperforms the common-slope model, revealing small and similar gains in two groups and much steeper growth in the third, with highly significant contrasts for excess weight gain.
  Interpretation: This case study gives a complete, executable workflow for longitudinal linear mixed modeling, from raw data and exploratory plots through model selection, diagnostics, and targeted contrasts. By making explicit the mapping from scientific questions to model terms and estimable contrasts, and by providing R code and a stepwise checklist, it serves as a practical template for teaching and applied work in biostatistics, epidemiology, and related fields</p>
