                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper introduces a novel computational method (Conditional Informatics Correlation Coefficient - CICC) that integrates conditional probability, information content, and XOR logic for robustly quantifying genetic linkage disequilibrium. While computational, it is presented as a statistical/informatics measure rather than explicitly an AI or machine learning model. Therefore, it is not explicitly a medical AI application, but a foundational computational tool for genetic analysis relevant to medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Numerous diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders, are associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), a small genomic region located on human chromosome 6. Adequate characterization of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the HLA across populations is crucial for identifying genetic markers associated with specific traits and phenotypes. However, current LD measures often fail to capture HLA's structural complexity due to methodological limitations and sensitivity to low-frequency variants, marginal allele frequencies, and haplotype composition. To address these challenges, we introduced the Conditional Informatics Correlation Coefficient (CICC), which integrates conditional probability, information content, and haplotype-aware XOR logic to quantify LD robustly. When applied to high-resolution haploid genomes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), CICC revealed 10 novel high-LD regions in HLA. Further analyses using the 1000 Genomes Project and Genome Asia datasets identified nine strongly linked regions shared across five global populations-five in Class I and four in Class II. These results demonstrate CICC's ability to capture complex HLA LD structures across populations, highlighting its broad potential for disease gene mapping, population genomics, and guiding precision medicine.</p>
