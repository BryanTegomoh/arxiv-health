                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SimBinder-IF, a novel computational method that transforms the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an efficient high-affinity antibody sequence generator. By selectively training ESM-IF's decoder with preference optimization to favor experimentally stronger binders, SimBinder-IF significantly improves the correlation between generated antibody sequences and measured binding affinities. The approach offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory affinity maturation, critical for antibody therapeutic development.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SimBinder-IF converts the pre-trained inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator. This is achieved by freezing ESM-IF's structure encoder, which processes 3D protein structures, and selectively training only its decoder component. The decoder is optimized using a preference optimization strategy to learn from experimental data, favoring sequences associated with higher binding affinities. The model's performance was evaluated using the AbBiBench benchmark, zero-shot generalization tests on unseen complexes, top-10 precision metrics for significant affinity improvements, and a specific case study involving redesigning an influenza antibody.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings include a substantial 55% relative increase in Spearman correlation with experimental binding affinity on the AbBiBench, reaching 0.410, and an even more significant 156% improvement in zero-shot generalization. SimBinder-IF also demonstrated superior precision in identifying highly improved affinity variants and predicted considerably stronger binding (lower Delta Delta G) in a real-world antibody redesign task. Critically, these performance gains were achieved with high parameter efficiency, training only a small fraction of the base model.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact is potentially transformative for the development of antibody-based medicines. SimBinder-IF can drastically reduce the time and resources currently spent on laboratory-based affinity maturation, leading to faster progression of drug candidates through preclinical stages. This could enable the discovery and optimization of more potent therapeutic antibodies for infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and other conditions, ultimately bringing more effective treatments to patients sooner and at a lower cost.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Motivation: The clinical efficacy of antibody therapeutics critically depends on high-affinity target engagement, yet laboratory affinity-maturation campaigns are slow and costly. In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.
  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements. A case study redesigning antibody F045-092 for A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) shows that SimBinder-IF proposes variants with substantially lower predicted binding free energy changes than ESM-IF (mean Delta Delta G -75.16 vs -46.57). Notably, SimBinder-IF trains only about 18 percent of the parameters of the full ESM-IF model, highlighting its parameter efficiency for high-affinity antibody generation.</p>
