                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DarkSPARC is a novel, self-calibrated spectral reconstruction method designed to transform standard bright-blood 3D Left Atrial (LA) Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI into dark-blood images. This technique significantly enhances image quality metrics like contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and effective CNR (eCNR), leading to more accurate post-ablation scar quantification in both numerical phantoms and in-vivo patient data. It provides reliable scar assessment without the need for additional scans or training data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate and reliable quantification of post-ablation left atrial scar is critical for assessing the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures and guiding subsequent patient management. DarkSPARC directly addresses the current limitations of bright-blood LGE MRI, which often underestimates scar burden due to poor contrast between scar and blood, providing a vital tool for improved clinical decision-making and patient care.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a 'spectral reconstruction method' that is 'training-free' and 'self-calibrated'. While this is an advanced computational method applied to medical imaging, the abstract does not explicitly mention AI, machine learning, or deep learning. The 'training-free' and 'self-calibrated' aspects suggest it may not rely on typical data-driven AI models that require extensive training. Therefore, based strictly on the abstract, it is an advanced *computational application* for medical image enhancement, but not explicitly identifiable as an AI application.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DarkSPARC is implemented as a retrospective, training-free, self-calibrated spectral reconstruction method. It embeds existing bright-blood 3D LA LGE MRI data into a calibrator-conditioned (N+1)-dimensional spectral domain. A dark-blood-like image is then reconstructed by leveraging scan-specific spectral landmarks inherent to the acquired data. The method's performance was rigorously evaluated through two main approaches: 1) a custom-built scan-specific 3D numerical phantom framework, derived from LAScarQS post-ablation LGE data, which allowed for controlled variation of scar burden and 10 levels of CNR degradation across 5 baseline cases (totaling 200 phantoms); and 2) in-vivo assessment using 60 public post-ablation MRI scans from atrial fibrillation patients. Key metrics quantified were LA scar-pool Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), effective CNR (eCNR), and Left Atrial Scar Percentage (Scar%).</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>In scan-specific numerical phantoms, DarkSPARC demonstrated significant improvements over bright-blood imaging, with LA scar-pool CNR and SNR ratios increasing up to approximately 30-fold and 6-fold, respectively, particularly under low-CNR conditions. It markedly reduced bias in LA Scar% quantification: from -37% to -54% with bright-blood at 70% CNR degradation, down to only -3% to -5% with DarkSPARC. In vivo, DarkSPARC similarly improved image metrics in 60 patient scans: median scar-pool CNR increased from 20.0 to 135.9 (6.8x), SNR from 70.6 to 200.6 (2.8x), and eCNR from 0.22 to 0.75 (3.4x), all with p<0.001 significance. The measured LA Scar% also increased from a median of 3.9% to 9.75% after DarkSPARC processing, indicating more comprehensive scar detection.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>DarkSPARC has the potential to significantly improve the clinical assessment of post-ablation left atrial scar. By providing a high-quality dark-blood LGE image from routine bright-blood acquisitions without additional scans or training, it enables more accurate and reproducible scar quantification. This enhanced accuracy can lead to better informed clinical decisions regarding the success of ablation procedures, identification of incomplete lesions, guidance for re-ablation strategies, and improved understanding of arrhythmia recurrence mechanisms, ultimately benefiting patient management in cardiac electrophysiology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To develop DarkSPARC, a retrospective, training-free, self-calibrated spectral reconstruction method that converts routine bright-blood 3D left atrial (LA) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI into a dark-blood image, and to quantify its impact on LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, effective CNR (eCNR), and scar quantification accuracy.
  Methods: DarkSPARC embeds bright-blood LA LGE into a calibrator-conditioned (N+1)-dimensional spectral domain and reconstructs a dark-blood-like image using scan-specific spectral landmarks. A scan-specific 3D numerical phantom framework was built from LAScarQS post-ablation LGE by cloning remote myocardium into the LA wall and imposing controlled scar burden. Five baseline cases spanning the 5th-95th percentiles of native scar-pool CNR, each with multiple scar burdens and 10 CNR degradation levels, yielded 200 phantoms. For every phantom, LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, eCNR, and Scar% were measured on bright-blood and DarkSPARC images. In vivo performance was evaluated in 60 public post-ablation scans of atrial fibrillation patients.
  Results: In scan-specific phantoms, DarkSPARC increased LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, and eCNR over bright-blood in all 200 experiments, with DarkSPARC/bright-blood ratios up to about 30-fold for CNR and about 6-fold for SNR in the lowest-CNR conditions. At 70% CNR degradation, bright-blood underestimated ground-truth LA Scar% by -37% to -54%, whereas DarkSPARC reduced bias to about -3% to -5%. In vivo, DarkSPARC similarly improved metrics: median scar-pool CNR, SNR, and eCNR increased from 20.0 to 135.9 (6.8x), 70.6 to 200.6 (2.8x), and 0.22 to 0.75 (3.4x), respectively (all p<0.001), and LA Scar% increased from 3.9% to 9.75%.
  Conclusion: DarkSPARC is a self-calibrated, training-free reconstruction that yields dark-blood 3D LA LGE, boosting CNR/SNR/eCNR and stabilizing reliable scar quantification without extra scans.</p>
