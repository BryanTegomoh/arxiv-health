                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to address the challenges of scarce annotations and significant domain gaps in medical imaging, where data originates from multiple unknown sources. The proposed method integrates a Copy-Paste Mechanism for data diversity and a Clustered Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block for domain-invariant representation learning within a teacher-student framework. It demonstrates robust and precise medical image segmentation performance, outperforming existing semi-supervised and domain adaptation techniques on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks, even with very few labeled examples.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed methodology combines three key components within a teacher-student framework: (1) A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring salient regions between images from different domains, increasing data diversity. (2) A Clustered Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block is introduced to learn domain-invariant features. It achieves this by clustering features from unlabeled data and then aligning these clusters with features from labeled 'anchor' domains using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric. (3) These mechanisms are integrated into a standard teacher-student semi-supervised learning architecture, where the teacher model guides the student model's learning on unlabeled data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.</p>
