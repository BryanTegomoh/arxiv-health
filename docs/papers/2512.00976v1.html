                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper reveals critical deficiencies in subgroup validity for machine learning models trained on open echocardiogram datasets. The authors demonstrate pervasive underreporting of patient demographics and insufficient representation of diverse groups, including a complete lack of gender-diverse patients, in current datasets. Through improved reporting and exploratory analysis of aortic stenosis models, they find insufficient evidence to support subgroup validity across sex, racial, and ethnic groups, highlighting a significant barrier to equitable AI deployment in cardiology.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Ensuring subgroup validity in AI models for echocardiogram interpretation is paramount for preventing biased diagnoses and exacerbating health disparities. Without it, AI tools could disproportionately benefit some patient groups while potentially harming or misdiagnosing others, undermining trust and clinical utility.</p>

This automation aims to expand access to accurate diagnostic readings for cardiac conditions. The research specifically focuses on ensuring these AI models perform accurately and equitably across diverse patient subgroups (based on gender, sex, race, ethnicity) to prevent biases and ensure reliable healthcare applications.</p>

The evaluation was limited to two specific aortic stenosis models and one dataset (TMED-2), which may not generalize to all deep learning models or echocardiogram datasets. Furthermore, the ability to assess certain subgroups was inherently limited by insufficient patient counts within the datasets.</p>

Finally, future research and development of AI models for medical applications should include mandatory subgroup-focused analyses to rigorously prove subgroup validity before deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Echocardiogram datasets enable training deep learning models to automate interpretation of cardiac ultrasound, thereby expanding access to accurate readings of diagnostically-useful images. However, the gender, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients in these datasets are underreported and subgroup-specific predictive performance is unevaluated. These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups. Our findings highlight that more data for underrepresented subgroups, improved demographic reporting, and subgroup-focused analyses are needed to prove subgroup validity in future work.</p>
