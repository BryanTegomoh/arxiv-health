                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GCA-ResUNet, a novel and efficient convolutional neural network for medical image segmentation. It integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks to effectively capture long-range dependencies across channels and spatial locations, addressing limitations of traditional U-Net architectures and computational burdens of Transformers. GCA-ResUNet achieves high accuracy, evidenced by Dice scores of 86.11% on Synapse and 92.64% on ACDC datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with minimal computational overhead.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.</p>
