                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved developing the Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method, which is based on entity-aware retrieval. This method was validated using a newly developed Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform. The platform compared CLEAR's performance against two baseline approaches: zero-shot large context inference and traditional chunk-based retrieval augmented generation. Evaluation was conducted on 12 diverse clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens, representing realistic EHR content. Key performance metrics included F1 score, win rate, average semantic similarity, and token usage.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>CLEAR achieved an F1 score of 0.90, surpassing embedding-based retrieval (0.86). In comprehensive testing, it obtained a 58.3% win rate and an average semantic similarity of 0.878 against competing methods. Crucially, CLEAR used 78% fewer tokens than wide context processing, indicating significant computational efficiency gains. The method demonstrated its strongest performance on long clinical notes (exceeding 65,000 tokens), achieving a 75% win rate, confirming the benefits of entity-aware retrieval for both accuracy and efficiency in clinical NLP.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The CLEAR method has the potential to revolutionize how healthcare professionals and systems interact with clinical data. It can enable more precise and rapid retrieval of patient information, aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning, and risk assessment. Reduced token usage translates to lower computational costs and faster processing, making advanced NLP solutions more scalable and economically viable for healthcare organizations. The evaluation platform itself offers a standardized tool for future development, fostering innovation in clinical question answering systems critical for advancing evidence-based medicine.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the CLEAR method or the study. However, the evaluation was conducted on a specific set of 12 clinical notes; while described as 'realistic,' the generalizability of these findings across all medical specialties, diverse patient populations, or different EHR systems would require further validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.</p>
