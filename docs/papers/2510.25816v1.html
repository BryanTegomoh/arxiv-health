                    <p>The study involved developing a 'Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform' specifically designed to validate the CLEAR method. This platform benchmarked CLEAR's performance against two established methods: zero-shot large context inference and traditional chunk-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The evaluation dataset comprised 12 realistic clinical notes sourced from EHRs, with lengths ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens, simulating real-world clinical documentation complexity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.</p>
