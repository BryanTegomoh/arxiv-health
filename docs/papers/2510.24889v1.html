                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an adaptive multitask EEG-based classifier for rapid stroke diagnosis, utilizing a GRU-TCN neural network to predict stroke type, lateralization, and severity from EEG signals. A key innovation is the integration of a deep Q-network (DQN) that adaptively tunes decision thresholds in real-time, significantly improving stroke-type diagnostic accuracy. The system aims to provide accurate, bedside-deployable tools for early stroke triage.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for improving acute stroke care by offering a potentially rapid, non-invasive, and highly accurate bedside diagnostic tool. Faster and more precise initial diagnosis can significantly impact treatment decisions, such as thrombolysis or thrombectomy, which are time-sensitive.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an adaptive EEG-based diagnostic system for stroke. It employs a recurrent-convolutional neural network (GRU-TCN) to analyze EEG signals and classify stroke type, hemispheric lateralization, and severity. A deep Q-network (DQN) is then used to dynamically adapt decision thresholds in real time, optimizing the diagnostic system's performance for clinically relevant sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, aiming for rapid and accurate bedside stroke triage.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a sequential process: First, 32-channel EEG raw signals are preprocessed and converted into power spectral density (PSD) features using Welch's method. These features are then fed into a hybrid deep learning model, a GRU-TCN (Gated Recurrent Unit - Temporal Convolutional Network), which acts as a multitask classifier to simultaneously predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric lateralization, and severity. Crucially, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) is implemented to perform real-time adaptive thresholding, allowing the decision boundaries of the classifier to be dynamically tuned for optimal sensitivity-specificity trade-offs based on clinical context. The system was validated using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke EIT/EEG dataset and tested for robustness on an independent ZJU4H low-density EEG cohort, adhering to STARD 2015 guidelines.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The baseline GRU-TCN achieved an accuracy of 89.3% (F1 92.8%) for stroke type, 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and 96.7% (F1 97.4%) for lateralization. With the integration of DQN for adaptive thresholding, the stroke-type accuracy significantly increased to 98.0% (F1 97.7%). The system also demonstrated robustness when tested on an independent, low-density EEG cohort. The adaptive thresholding capability allows for tailoring diagnostic operating points to clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, supported by integrated scalp-map and spectral visualizations for interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The proposed adaptive EEG-based diagnostic system holds significant clinical promise for improving rapid stroke triage, particularly in pre-hospital or emergency department settings where immediate access to advanced imaging (CT/MRI) might be limited. Its ability to accurately classify stroke type, lateralization, and severity at the bedside could expedite critical treatment decisions (e.g., distinguishing ischemic stroke for thrombolysis from hemorrhagic stroke where it's contraindicated), potentially reducing time-to-treatment and improving patient outcomes. The adaptive thresholding also allows clinicians to adjust the diagnostic sensitivity/specificity based on specific clinical scenarios or risk tolerance.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation noted is the relatively small size of the main validation dataset (UCLH Stroke EIT/EEG dataset with 44 recordings, comprising about 26 acute stroke patients and 10 controls), which might limit the generalizability of the findings and the robustness of the deep learning model's training. While robustness was tested on an independent dataset (ZJU4H), the specific characteristics and size of this cohort are not fully detailed in the abstract.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.</p>
