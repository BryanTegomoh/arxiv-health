                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DMAGT employs a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network architecture. It models drug-miRNA interactions as graphs. Drug molecular structures, typically represented by SMILES strings, and miRNA base sequences are first converted into numerical feature vectors using Word2Vec embeddings. These embeddings, along with the relational information from the graph structure, are then fed into a graph transformer model, which learns complex patterns to predict the likelihood of an association between a given drug and miRNA.</p>

Crucially, in a focused practical validation for two specific drugs, 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin, 14 out of the 20 highest-confidence predicted drug-miRNA associations were experimentally confirmed, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy and real-world utility.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">MiRNAs, due to their role in gene regulation, have paved a new pathway for pharmacology, focusing on drug development that targets miRNAs. However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated. The above experiments demonstrate that DMAGT has an excellent performance and stability in predicting drug-miRNA associations, providing a new shortcut for miRNA drug development.</p>
