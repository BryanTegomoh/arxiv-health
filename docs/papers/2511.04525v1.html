                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>STC-Net is a novel deep learning framework that directly analyzes full Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC) videos to estimate surgical complexity using the Parkland Grading Scale (PGS).

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The evaluation was conducted on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos. While substantial, the 'private' nature of the dataset might imply a lack of diversity or potential institutional bias, which could limit the immediate generalizability of the findings to other surgical centers or broader patient populations. No other specific limitations are explicitly mentioned in the abstract.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.</p>
