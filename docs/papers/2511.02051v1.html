                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing offers a promising framework for
scalable quantum machine learning, leveraging optical systems with
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. While discrete-variable (DV) quantum
neural networks have shown remarkable progress in various computer vision
tasks, CV quantum models remain comparatively underexplored. In this work, we
present a feasibility study of continuous-variable quantum neural networks
(CV-QCNNs) applied to biomedical image classification. Utilizing photonic
circuit simulation frameworks, we construct CV quantum circuits composed of
Gaussian gates, such as displacement, squeezing, rotation, and beamsplitters to
emulate convolutional behavior. Our experiments are conducted on the MedMNIST
dataset collection, a set of annotated medical image benchmarks for multiple
diagnostic tasks. We evaluate CV-QCNN's performance in terms of classification
accuracy, model expressiveness, and resilience to Gaussian noise, comparing
against classical CNNs and equivalent DV quantum circuits. This study aims to
identify trade-offs between DV and CV paradigms for quantum-enhanced medical
imaging. Our results highlight the potential of continuous-variable models and
their viability for future computer-aided diagnosis systems.</p>
