                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses Best Arm Identification (BAI) problems with feasibility constraints, where performance and constraint measurements can be conducted independently, as seen in drug discovery. The authors propose an efficient algorithm for the fixed confidence setting that intelligently allocates resources to test for an arm's performance or its specific feasibility constraints. The algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimal in its sample complexity and empirically outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides an AI algorithm (Best Arm Identification with feasibility tests) designed to efficiently identify the best performing option (e.g., drug candidate, treatment protocol) while simultaneously ensuring it meets critical safety or feasibility constraints. In a health context, this could accelerate drug discovery by optimizing the screening process for compounds that are both potent and safe, streamline clinical trial design by efficiently testing different treatment arms under specific safety criteria, and potentially contribute to personalized medicine by identifying treatments that are most effective for an individual while adhering to their specific health or safety thresholds.</p>

                    <li>**Novel Problem Formulation:** Extends traditional Best Arm Identification (BAI) by requiring the identified 'best arm' to satisfy additional feasibility constraints (e.g., safety thresholds) in addition to high performance.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Decoupled Measurement Strategy:** Addresses the practical challenge where an arm's performance (e.g., drug potency) and its feasibility constraints (e.g., toxicity, solubility) are measured through separate, independent experiments, a deviation from prior BAI assumptions.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Resource-Efficient Algorithm:** Proposes a novel BAI algorithm that allows the decision-maker to strategically choose between testing an arm for its performance or any of its N specific feasibility constraints, optimizing the allocation of sampling resources.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Adaptive Arm Elimination:** The algorithm is designed to adaptively eliminate suboptimal arms, whether due to inferior performance or violation of feasibility constraints, prioritizing the discovery of whichever condition is easier to ascertain.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed a new algorithm for constrained Best Arm Identification in a fixed confidence setting. The algorithm allows for independent sampling of an arm's performance or any of its multiple feasibility constraints. Its theoretical performance was rigorously analyzed by deriving sample complexity upper bounds and a matching lower bound, demonstrating asymptotic optimality. The algorithm's practical efficacy was validated through extensive empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing its performance against existing BAI methods.</p>

                    <p>The study's key findings include the development of an efficient and asymptotically optimal algorithm for constrained BAI where performance and feasibility tests are decoupled. This algorithm adaptively allocates resources to eliminate arms based on either performance or constraint violations, whichever is easier to detect.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact of this work is significant, especially in pre-clinical drug discovery and development. By efficiently identifying drug candidates that are both highly potent and satisfy critical safety (e.g., low toxicity) and pharmacokinetic (e.g., solubility) thresholds, the algorithm can drastically reduce the time and cost associated with screening vast libraries of compounds. This could lead to faster identification of viable drug leads, accelerating the pipeline for new and safer medications to reach patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>
