                    <p>The study developed a two-stage automated WBRT planning pipeline. The first stage involved training a deep learning (DL) model on geometric features of clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) from 55 WBRT cases to predict optimal Auto-FiF hyperparameters for the RayStation treatment planning system. The second stage integrated an LLM-based conversational interface, where voice input feedback (transcribed by Whisper) was interpreted by GPT-4o to adjust planning settings for suboptimal plans. The system was evaluated on 15 independent cases using clinical dosimetric metrics, expert review, and analysis of workflow timing.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The DL-based hyperparameter prediction module successfully generated clinically acceptable plans in 14 of 15 independent cases. Normalized to identical CTV D95%, these plans showed no statistically significant differences in doses to critical OARs (eyes, lenses) and CTV dose metrics (D1%, D99%) compared to clinical plans. The automated workflow dramatically reduced planning time to approximately 7 minutes total execution (under 1 minute computation) from 15 minutes for manual planning. Furthermore, the LLM-driven conversational module effectively improved dose conformity and reduced hotspots in plans identified as suboptimal.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations include the relatively small dataset size used for training the DL model (55 cases) and for independent evaluation (15 cases), which may impact the generalizability across diverse patient populations and institutions. The reliance on a specific treatment planning system (RayStation) and a commercial LLM (GPT-4o) also implies potential dependencies or integration challenges in other clinical environments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is a common treatment due to its simplicity and effectiveness. While automated Field-in-Field (Auto-FiF) functions assist WBRT planning in modern treatment planning systems, it still requires manual approaches for optimal plan generation including patient-specific hyperparameters definition and plan refinement based on quality feedback. This study introduces an automated WBRT planning pipeline that integrates a deep learning (DL) Hyperparameter Prediction model for patient-specific parameter generation and a large-language model (LLM)-based conversational interface for interactive plan refinement. The Hyperparameter Prediction module was trained on 55 WBRT cases using geometric features of clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) to determine optimal Auto-FiF settings in RayStation treatment planning system. Plans were generated under predicted hyperparameters. For cases in which the generated plan was suboptimal, quality feedback via voice input was captured by a Conversation module, transcribed using Whisper, and interpreted by GPT-4o to adjust planning settings. Plan quality was evaluated in 15 independent cases using clinical metrics and expert review, and model explainability was supported through analysis of feature importance. Fourteen of 15 DL-generated plans were clinically acceptable. Normalized to identical CTV D95% as the clinical plans, the DL-generated and clinical plans showed no statistically significant differences in doses to the eyes, lenses, or CTV dose metrics D1% and D99%. The DL-based planning required under 1 minute of computation and achieved total workflow execution in approximately 7 minutes with a single mouse click, compared to 15 minutes for manual planning. In cases requiring adjustment, the Conversational module successfully improved dose conformity and hotspot reduction.</p>
