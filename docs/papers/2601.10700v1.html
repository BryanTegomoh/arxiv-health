                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces LIBERTy, a novel causal framework designed to benchmark concept-based explanations of Large Language Models (LLMs) using structural counterfactuals, addressing the limitations of costly and imperfect human-written counterfactuals. LIBERTy constructs datasets by defining Structured Causal Models (SCMs) where concept interventions propagate to LLMs for counterfactual generation. The framework, applied across medical and other high-stakes domains, reveals significant room for improving explanation methods and highlights reduced sensitivity of proprietary LLMs to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In high-stakes medical domains, understanding how concepts like patient demographics, symptoms, or medical history influence an LLM's diagnostic or predictive output is crucial for trust, accountability, and ethical AI deployment. LIBERTy provides a rigorous method to evaluate and enhance the faithfulness of these concept-based explanations, which is vital for developing reliable clinical decision support systems and mitigating bias in medical AI.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The LIBERTy framework is built upon explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) that model the underlying text generation process. Interventions on specific high-level concepts (e.g., gender, experience) are applied within these SCMs. These interventions propagate through the causal graph, dictating how an LLM subsequently generates the corresponding structural counterfactual text. This process creates datasets of counterfactual pairs. The faithfulness of concept-based explanations is then evaluated against these causally derived reference targets using a newly proposed metric called 'order-faithfulness'.</p>

A significant observation was that proprietary LLMs exhibited a markedly reduced sensitivity to interventions involving demographic concepts, suggesting the impact of post-training mitigation strategies on their behavior regarding sensitive attributes.</p>

                <p>LIBERTy offers a critical tool for advancing the development of more trustworthy and transparent AI systems in healthcare. By rigorously benchmarking and improving the faithfulness of how LLMs explain their reasoning based on clinical or demographic concepts, it can lead to more reliable diagnostic tools, fairer risk assessments, and more equitable treatment recommendations, ultimately enhancing patient safety and clinician trust in AI-driven medical insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.</p>
