                <p>This research provides a novel causal framework and benchmark (LIBERTy) for evaluating the faithfulness of concept-based explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs). When applied to medical contexts, such as disease detection, this framework helps ensure that LLMs used for diagnosis or patient care provide transparent and reliable explanations for their decisions. It also enables the systematic analysis of an LLM's sensitivity to critical demographic concepts, which is vital for identifying and mitigating bias in medical AI applications, thereby promoting more equitable and trustworthy healthcare AI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.</p>
