                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">LIBERTy is a novel framework that uses explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structural counterfactuals, creating robust benchmarks for evaluating concept-based explanations of LLMs. This addresses the limitations of costly and imperfect human-written counterfactuals, providing new datasets (including for disease detection) and a metric for faithful evaluation. The framework reveals substantial headroom for improving current explanation methods and identifies reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts in proprietary LLMs, likely due to post-training mitigation.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The LIBERTy framework is built upon explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) that describe the data generation process for text. Interventions are simulated on high-level concepts within these SCMs. The effects of these interventions propagate through the causal model, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are then used to generate the corresponding structural counterfactual texts. These generated counterfactual pairs serve as ground truth for evaluating the faithfulness of concept-based explanations. A new metric, "order-faithfulness," is introduced for this evaluation. The framework was applied to create datasets for specific tasks, including disease detection.</p>

                    <p>The study found substantial headroom for improving the faithfulness of existing concept-based explanation methods across various LLMs. Additionally, it revealed a significant difference in model sensitivity to interventions: proprietary LLMs showed markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts compared to other models, which is attributed to post-training mitigation efforts.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By providing a robust benchmark for evaluating concept-based explanations, LIBERTy can significantly enhance the trustworthiness and transparency of AI systems in clinical settings. This will enable the development of more reliable medical AI that can explain *why* a diagnosis or treatment recommendation is made based on specific clinical factors, facilitating better physician-AI collaboration and patient communication. Furthermore, by rigorously testing for concept sensitivity, it can help identify and mitigate biases related to sensitive demographic concepts in medical AI, fostering more equitable healthcare outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the abstract frames LIBERTy as a solution to prior limitations, implicit limitations could include: the quality of the generated structural counterfactuals being dependent on the LLM's capabilities and potential biases; the complexity of accurately defining exhaustive SCMs for highly intricate real-world medical scenarios; and the framework's effectiveness being tied to the ability to explicitly define and intervene on specific high-level concepts, which may not always be straightforward for all medical contexts.</p>

                <p>LIBERTy is positioned as a benchmark crucial for the future development of faithful explainability methods. This implies ongoing research to: develop more accurate and robust concept-based explanation techniques utilizing this benchmark; further investigate the causal mechanisms and sensitivities of various LLMs, particularly concerning critical medical and demographic concepts; and potentially expand the framework to cover a broader array of complex clinical scenarios and high-level medical concepts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.</p>
