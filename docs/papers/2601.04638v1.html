                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">SpeechMedAssist proposes a novel two-stage training paradigm for Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) to enable efficient and effective speech-based multi-turn medical consultations. By decoupling knowledge injection from modality re-alignment, the approach significantly reduces the need for medical speech data to just 10k synthesized samples. The model demonstrates superior performance over baselines in both effectiveness and robustness across various evaluation settings on a newly designed medical consultation benchmark.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves a novel two-stage training paradigm for SpeechLMs. The first stage, 'Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text,' focuses on imparting medical domain knowledge and conversational capabilities using readily available text-based data. The second stage, 'Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data,' leverages the architectural properties of SpeechLMs to efficiently align the model for speech input using a very small dataset of only 10k synthesized medical speech samples. Evaluation was performed on a newly designed benchmark comprising single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has the potential to significantly improve patient engagement and satisfaction by enabling more intuitive, speech-driven AI interactions for medical consultations, akin to natural human conversations. It could lead to more accessible and efficient initial patient assessments, symptom checkers, and chronic disease management tools, particularly beneficial for telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and assisting healthcare professionals by automating routine conversational tasks. The reduced data barrier also makes AI-driven speech solutions more viable for broader clinical deployment.</p>

It highlights that *prior* works faced challenges due to the scarcity of medical speech data and inefficient direct fine-tuning, which SpeechMedAssist aims to overcome.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical consultations are intrinsically speech-centric. However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.</p>
