                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">X-ray microtomography at synchrotron sources is fundamentally limited by the
high radiation dose applied to the samples, which restricts investigations to
non-native tissue states and thereby compromises the biological relevance of
the resulting data. The limitation stems from inefficient indirect detection
schemes that require prolonged exposures. Efforts to extract additional
contrast through multimodal techniques, like modulation-based imaging, worsen
the problem by requiring multiple tomographic scans. In addition, the
techniques suffer from low modulator pattern visibility, which reduces
measurement efficiency and sensitivity. We address both the detection
efficiency and modulation visibility challenges using a novel setup that
combines an X-ray waveguide, a structured phase modulator, and a
photon-counting detector. Our approach simultaneously achieves near-theoretical
limits in both visibility (95%) and quantum efficiency (98%), thereby enabling
dose-efficient multimodal microtomography at single-micrometer resolution. This
advance will enable new classes of experiments on native-state biological
specimens with the potential to advance biomedical research, disease
diagnostics, and our understanding of tissue structure in physiological
environments.</p>
