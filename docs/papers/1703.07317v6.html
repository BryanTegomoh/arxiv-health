                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the fundamental predictability limits of infectious disease outbreaks using information theory and permutation entropy across diverse historical disease time series. It identifies an inherent "entropy barrier" to forecasting but finds this barrier is generally well beyond the typical duration of single outbreaks, indicating practical predictability is often achievable. The study also highlights disease-specific forecast horizons influenced by changing model structures and social network heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research directly informs the potential and inherent limitations of epidemiological forecasting, which is crucial for public health decision-making, resource allocation, and timely intervention planning during infectious disease outbreaks. Understanding these fundamental limits allows for more realistic expectations of predictive models and guides the development of more effective forecasting strategies to mitigate health impacts.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself investigates fundamental limits using an information-theoretic approach (permutation entropy), its findings are directly applicable and foundational for the development and improvement of AI/Machine Learning models in health. Epidemiological forecasting is a rapidly growing field that heavily leverages AI/ML. This research, by identifying 'entropy barriers' and highlighting the importance of 'moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches,' provides critical insights that would guide the design, selection, and optimization of AI algorithms (e.g., deep learning, complex network analysis, agent-based models) used for predicting disease spread, resource allocation, and evaluating intervention strategies in public health and healthcare.</p>

                <p>The results provide critical insights for public health officials and healthcare systems by setting realistic expectations for the accuracy and lead time of infectious disease forecasts. This can directly inform resource allocation (e.g., prophylactic equipment, therapeutics, vaccine distribution), healthcare staffing, and the timing of public health interventions. By understanding disease-specific predictability, it encourages a shift towards dynamic modeling for more robust predictions, enhancing preparedness and response strategies during epidemics and pandemics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and their shared environment. As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, chlamydia, dengue, gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, and whooping cough--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches, and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.</p>
