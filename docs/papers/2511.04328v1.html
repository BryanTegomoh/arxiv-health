                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces RxSafeBench, a novel framework and comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating the medication safety capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in simulated clinical consultations. It addresses critical gaps in real-world data and realistic evaluation by generating inquiry-diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks, supported by the RxRisk DB knowledge base. The findings reveal that current LLMs significantly struggle to integrate contraindication and drug interaction knowledge, particularly when risks are implied rather than explicit, underscoring major challenges for AI-driven clinical decision support.</p>

                    <p>Current Large Language Models exhibit significant difficulty in integrating complex contraindication and drug interaction knowledge. This struggle is particularly pronounced when medication risks are implicitly suggested within the patient's context rather than explicitly stated, indicating a deficiency in inferential reasoning for medication safety.</p>

                <p>RxSafeBench provides a crucial, standardized tool for rigorously evaluating the medication safety of AI models, thereby facilitating the development and responsible deployment of safer AI-driven clinical decision support systems. The identified limitations of LLMs in recognizing implied risks necessitate increased caution for clinicians adopting these technologies and guide developers to prioritize robustness in handling nuanced medication safety scenarios, ultimately aiming to reduce medication errors and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.</p>
