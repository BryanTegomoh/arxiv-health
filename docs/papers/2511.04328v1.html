                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces RxSafeBench, a novel benchmark and framework for systematically evaluating the medication safety capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in simulated clinical consultations. It addresses the lack of real-world data and evaluation in realistic settings by creating a dedicated medication safety database (RxRisk DB) and generating high-quality consultation scenarios. The study reveals that current LLMs struggle significantly with integrating contraindication and drug interaction knowledge, particularly when risks are implicitly stated, underscoring critical safety concerns for AI-driven clinical decision support.</p>

                    <p>Current Large Language Models consistently demonstrate significant difficulty in integrating and applying medication safety knowledge, specifically regarding contraindications and drug interactions. This deficiency is markedly more pronounced when medication risks are implicitly present within the patient context rather than explicitly stated, indicating a fundamental lack of robust contextual understanding and inferential reasoning in existing models concerning medication safety.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.</p>
