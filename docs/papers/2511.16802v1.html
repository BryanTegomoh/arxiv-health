                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops a mathematical model for mosquito-borne epidemic outbreaks that incorporates human protective behavior influenced by information on disease prevalence. It demonstrates that such information-dependent behavior can have complex and sometimes counterintuitive effects, potentially either containing an outbreak or, paradoxically, prolonging its duration and even inducing recurrent epidemic waves.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding how public information and subsequent behavioral changes influence the dynamics of vector-borne diseases is critical for developing effective public health interventions, managing outbreaks, and designing targeted communication strategies to mitigate disease spread.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a mathematical modeling approach for mosquito-borne epidemics. It incorporates human behavioral changes that are dependent on real-time information regarding disease prevalence. A central methodological tool is the application of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to simplify a two-group host model into a more tractable homogeneous host population model, based on the assumption that changes in opinion occur on a faster timescale than disease spread. Numerical simulations are utilized to illustrate and validate the analytical results derived from the model.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Human protective behavior, when influenced by information on disease prevalence, can exert a complex and often dual effect on epidemic outbreaks. While such behavior can contribute to reducing the basic reproduction number and containing an epidemic, it can also lead to unanticipated outcomes. Specifically, information-induced behavioral changes might prolong the duration of an epidemic and even trigger recurrent damped epidemic waves, even in scenarios with a low overall attack rate. The relative speed of opinion dynamics compared to disease transmission is a critical factor determining these outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research underscores the crucial importance of carefully managed and transparent public health communication during mosquito-borne epidemics. Ineffective or misunderstood information leading to certain behavioral responses could inadvertently extend outbreaks or complicate control efforts, rather than mitigate them. It suggests that public health strategies for vector-borne diseases must integrate not only traditional vector control and treatment but also a deep understanding and strategic guidance of human behavioral responses to information, to prevent paradoxical outcomes and ensure effective disease management.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations; however, typical for theoretical models, the reliance on specific assumptions (e.g., opinion changes occurring much faster than disease spread) and the simplification to a homogeneous host population might limit direct applicability to all real-world scenarios without further validation. The generalizability across diverse societal contexts or all types of mosquito-borne diseases would require empirical testing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We study a model for a mosquito-borne epidemic outbreak in which humans can adopt protective behaviour against vector bites depending on information on the past and present prevalence. Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results.</p>
