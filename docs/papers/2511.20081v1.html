                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD), a novel method designed to overcome the challenges of spatially varying and heteroscedastic noise inherent in Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI data. BALD adaptively stabilizes noise distributions and employs a two-stage denoising process to accurately disentangle molecular signals. Validated extensively, BALD consistently outperforms existing CEST denoisers, significantly improving the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping and downstream tasks like cancer detection, thereby accelerating CEST's clinical translation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>CEST MRI offers molecular-level visualization of metabolites, crucial for early disease detection and monitoring. By accurately denoising CEST data, BALD enables more reliable quantitative contrast mapping, directly enhancing the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of this advanced imaging technique for various medical conditions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While BALD itself is an advanced image processing and signal processing technique rather than a direct AI model for diagnosis, it plays a critical role as an enabling technology for medical AI applications. By providing blind adaptive local denoising for CEST MRI data, it significantly improves the quality and accuracy of input data. High-quality, denoised medical images are essential for training robust and accurate AI models for tasks like cancer detection, quantitative molecular mapping, and disease prognostication, which are explicitly mentioned as downstream tasks improved by this method.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection.</p>
