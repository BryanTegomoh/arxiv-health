                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel fine evaluation method for the Cube Copying Test (CCT) to improve early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by addressing the limitations of traditional binary scoring. Utilizing dynamic handwriting analysis and a BiLSTM-Attention neural network, the method achieves 86.69% accuracy in classifying cognitive impairment, revealing nuanced correlations between drawing ability scores, age, and education levels. This provides a more objective and comprehensive tool for early screening and personalized intervention for visual spatial cognitive impairment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Impairment of visual spatial cognitive function is the most common early clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) uses the "0/1" binary method ("pass/fail") to evaluate the visual spatial cognitive ability represented by the Cube Copying Test(CCT), the elder with less formal education generally score 0 point, resulting in serious bias in the evaluation results. Therefore, this study proposes a fine evaluation method for CCT based on dynamic handwriting feature extraction of DH-SCSM-BLA. method : The Cogni-CareV3.0 software independently developed by our team was used to collect dynamic handwriting data of CCT. Then, the spatial and motion features of segmented dynamic handwriting were extracted, and feature matrix with unequal dimensions were normalized. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network model combined with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention) was adopted for classification. Result: The experimental results showed that: The proposed method has significant superiority compared to similar studies, with a classification accuracy of 86.69%. The distribution of cube drawing ability scores has significant regularity for three aspects such as MCI patients and healthy control group, age, and levels of education. It was also found that score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score is negatively correlated with age. Score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score, but positively correlated with levels of education significantly. Conclusion: This study provides a relatively objective and comprehensive evaluation method for early screening and personalized intervention of visual spatial cognitive impairment.</p>
