                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">UKAST is a novel U-Net-like architecture that integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders for medical image segmentation. This approach addresses the limitations of standard CNNs and Transformers by achieving state-of-the-art performance on four diverse medical benchmarks, particularly excelling in data-scarce environments. By leveraging Group Rational KANs, UKAST offers a more expressive, data-efficient, and computationally optimized framework, significantly advancing medical image analysis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST</p>
