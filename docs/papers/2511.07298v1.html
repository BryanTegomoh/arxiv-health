                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Low-dose computed tomography (CT) represents a significant improvement in
patient safety through lower radiation doses, but increased noise, blur, and
contrast loss can diminish diagnostic quality. Therefore, consistency and
robustness in image quality assessment become essential for clinical
applications. In this study, we propose an LLM-based quality assessment system
that generates both numerical scores and textual descriptions of degradations
such as noise, blur, and contrast loss. Furthermore, various inference
strategies - from the zero-shot approach to metadata integration and error
feedback - are systematically examined, demonstrating the progressive
contribution of each method to overall performance. The resultant assessments
yield not only highly correlated scores but also interpretable output, thereby
adding value to clinical workflows. The source codes of our study are available
at https://github.com/itu-biai/lmms_ldct_iqa.</p>
