                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a trustworthy and frequency-aware segmentation framework for accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in clinical photographs. The framework achieves superior performance (85.05% Dice, significantly reduced boundary error), consistently outperforming strong baselines, and provides interpretable pixel-wise uncertainty maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Its high reliability, marked by zero catastrophic failures, suggests a robust standard for automated vitiligo assessment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in routine clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.</p>
