                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC), a novel method for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification using structural MRI (sMRI) images. MVSC compresses high-dimensional 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed visual surrogates, which are then optimally processed by frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations. The method addresses existing challenges in AD diagnosis by enhancing computational efficiency, preserving cross-slice context, and improving feature discriminability, demonstrating favorable performance on multiple large-scale AD benchmarks.</p>

                    <li>**Problem Addressed**: Existing sMRI-based AD classification methods face issues such as high computational cost (3D CNNs), loss of crucial cross-slice relations (slice-wise methods), or limited discriminative feature extraction (training-free 2D foundation models).</li>
                    
                    <li>**Proposed Solution**: Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC) is developed to transform large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D 'visual surrogates'.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Core Mechanism**: These visual surrogates are designed for optimal alignment with and processing by frozen 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO) to extract robust, discriminative representations for AD classification.</li>
                    
                    <li>**MVSC Architecture**: The method comprises two key components: a 'Volume Context Encoder' that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an 'Adaptive Slice Fusion' module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Multimodal Integration**: The 'multimodal' aspect stems from the utilization of textual guidance within both components, facilitating a richer contextual understanding beyond purely visual data.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Empirical Validation**: MVSC was extensively evaluated on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks.</li>

                    <p>MVSC employs a deep learning-based approach to compress and adapt high-dimensional 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D 'visual surrogates'. This compression is designed to facilitate more effective feature extraction by pre-trained, frozen 2D foundation models. The architecture includes a 'Volume Context Encoder' that captures global contextual information across slices using textual guidance, and an 'Adaptive Slice Fusion' module that aggregates slice-level details in a text-enhanced, patch-wise fashion. The resulting 2D representations are then fed into frozen 2D foundation models (like DINO) to extract powerful features used for the final binary or multi-class AD classification.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.</p>
