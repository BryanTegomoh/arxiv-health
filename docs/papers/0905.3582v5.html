                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method to reverse-engineer the underlying network topology and transmission parameters driving infectious disease outbreaks. By employing stochastic differential equations within a meta-population framework and maximal likelihood estimation on early growth phase data, it can uncover the effectively decisive network structure and epidemiological parameters. The method's efficacy was demonstrated using both synthetic datasets and real-world data from the SARS outbreak.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity are of great interest recently in studying the spread of an infectious disease. The presented method solves an inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with computationally synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset on SARS outbreak.</p>
