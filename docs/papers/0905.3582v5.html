                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel method for an inverse problem, aiming to uncover the effectively decisive network topology and key transmission parameters governing an infectious disease outbreak. By analyzing data from the early growth phase, it employs stochastic differential equations to model populations within a combined epidemiological compartment and meta-population network framework. The approach leverages probability density functions and maximal likelihood estimation, validated with both computationally synthesized datasets and real-world WHO SARS outbreak data.</p>

                    <p>The method solves an inverse problem by describing populations through stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity are of great interest recently in studying the spread of an infectious disease. The presented method solves an inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with computationally synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset on SARS outbreak.</p>
