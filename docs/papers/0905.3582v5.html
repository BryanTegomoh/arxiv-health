                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method to solve an inverse problem, identifying the effectively decisive network topology and transmission parameters governing stochastic infectious disease spread. It leverages early growth phase outbreak data by integrating stochastic differential equations with epidemiological compartment and meta-population network models, using maximal likelihood estimation for inference. The method was validated with both synthetic and real-world SARS outbreak data.</p>

                    <p>The paper presents a method to solve an inverse problem using maximal likelihood estimation (MLE). It describes populations within a meta-population network model and epidemiological compartment models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) via stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Probability density functions (PDFs) are derived from these SDEs, which are then utilized for MLE to estimate the effectively decisive network topology and the associated transmission parameters from observed outbreak data.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research can significantly improve public health responses by enabling earlier and more precise identification of critical transmission pathways and high-risk populations during an outbreak's initial growth phase. This allows for targeted, efficient allocation of resources and interventions (e.g., vaccination, contact tracing, isolation strategies) to contain the spread more effectively and mitigate its impact on public health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity are of great interest recently in studying the spread of an infectious disease. The presented method solves an inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with computationally synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset on SARS outbreak.</p>
