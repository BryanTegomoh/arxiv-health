                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical gap between retrieval and reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) within clinical settings, using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. It proposes an evaluation framework to assess the accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of LLM reasoning, highlighting that errors persist even when authoritative information is provided. The research underscores that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, safe clinical deployment mandates rigorous evaluation of reasoning capabilities, not just retrieval.</p>

While RAG can effectively constrain model outputs, the study revealed that safe clinical deployment requires a dedicated and rigorous assessment of the model's reasoning capabilities, not solely its information retrieval prowess.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.</p>
