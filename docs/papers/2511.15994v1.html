                <p>This research is directly applicable to developing and evaluating AI systems (specifically LLMs using RAG) for tasks requiring complex clinical assessment and reasoning. Potential applications include AI-powered clinical decision support systems, tools for ensuring adherence to clinical protocols (like WET guidelines), and AI assistants for clinicians in areas like therapy, where accurate and consistent reasoning from evidence is crucial. The paper's focus on evaluating reasoning is vital for the safe and effective deployment of such medical AI applications.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.</p>
