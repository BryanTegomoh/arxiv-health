                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a unified multiclass machine learning framework to detect ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. Utilizing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline and fine-tuning transformer models, the study identified the domain-adapted MentalBERT as the top performer, achieving 0.92 accuracy and 0.76 Macro F1. The system is designed as an explainable, human-in-the-loop screening aid for moderators, not a diagnostic tool.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved curating social media datasets from Twitter and Reddit. A "split-then-balance" pipeline was used to preprocess data for training (balanced) and evaluation (realistic imbalanced test set). A comprehensive comparative analysis was performed on traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformer models, including the domain-adapted MentalBERT. Model performance was measured using accuracy and Macro F1 score. Additionally, a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework was developed, and a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") was built to integrate predictions and explanations.</p>

                    <p>End-to-end fine-tuning was found to be critical for achieving high performance in detecting mental health conditions and cyberbullying. The domain-adapted MentalBERT model significantly outperformed other evaluated models, including its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology holds significant potential as a screening aid for mental health professionals, community support workers, and platform moderators. It could facilitate early identification of individuals at risk of mental health conditions or cyberbullying, enabling targeted outreach, resource allocation, and timely intervention. The integrated explainability (SHAPLLM) and prototype dashboard enhance its utility by providing actionable insights, supporting human-in-the-loop decision-making, and potentially improving patient safety and well-being in digital spaces.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The paper implicitly highlights a limitation by emphasizing the future need for "multi-label, clinically-validated datasets." This suggests that the current datasets, while curated, may lack the granularity of multi-label annotations or full clinical validation, which could impact the system's ability to detect co-occurring conditions or its direct applicability in a formal clinical diagnostic context. The system is also explicitly defined as a screening aid, not a diagnostic tool, indicating its inherent limitations for medical diagnosis.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on developing and utilizing multi-label, clinically-validated datasets to enhance the system's ability to detect complex, co-occurring mental health conditions. Further exploration of generalizable approaches across diverse social media platforms and integration with real-world clinical workflows for validation and impact assessment are also crucial.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.</p>
