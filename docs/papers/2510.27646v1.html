                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces VessShape, a novel methodology for generating large-scale synthetic 2D datasets designed to instill a strong shape bias in blood vessel segmentation models. By leveraging geometric priors like tubular and branching structures while varying textures, VessShape aims to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization across different imaging modalities. The pre-trained models demonstrate robust few-shot performance, requiring minimal real-world annotations (4-10 samples) for fine-tuning, and exhibit notable zero-shot capabilities in unseen domains.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.</p>
