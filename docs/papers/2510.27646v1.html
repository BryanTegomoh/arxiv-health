                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces VessShape, a novel methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a strong shape bias in blood vessel segmentation models. By leveraging procedurally generated tubular geometries with diverse textures, VessShape enables models to learn geometric priors rather than texture-based features, leading to robust few-shot and zero-shot segmentation performance on real-world medical images across different modalities. The research demonstrates that pre-training with this shape bias effectively overcomes data scarcity and improves model generalization in a critical medical imaging task.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>VessShape is a methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets. These datasets are procedurally created with intricate tubular vessel geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures. This design explicitly encourages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn geometric shape cues (a 'shape bias') rather than texture-based features. A segmentation model is then pre-trained on these synthetic images and subsequently evaluated for few-shot performance (with 4-10 samples for fine-tuning) and zero-shot generalization on real-world medical imaging datasets from different domains.</p>

Specifically, models achieved strong few-shot segmentation performance on two different real-world medical datasets, requiring only 4 to 10 samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the pre-trained model demonstrated notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting blood vessels in unseen imaging domains without any target-specific training or fine-tuning, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse visual characteristics.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to substantially accelerate the development and clinical deployment of AI-powered blood vessel segmentation tools. By drastically reducing the need for extensive, costly, and time-consuming manual annotations, it can make advanced diagnostic and therapeutic planning accessible for more diseases and patient populations. Improved generalization across modalities could lead to more consistent and reliable clinical assessments, assisting in early disease detection, treatment monitoring, and surgical guidance, particularly in resource-constrained environments or for rare conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.</p>
