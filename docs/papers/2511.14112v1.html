                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the significant challenge of the long-tail distribution in automatic ICD coding from clinical text, where thousands of rare diagnostic codes are underrepresented. It proposes a data-centric framework that generates 90,000 high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this data imbalance. The approach leads to modest but crucial improvements in macro-F1 for rare codes while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior state-of-the-art models and enhancing equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate automatic ICD coding is vital for proper medical billing, epidemiological studies, and healthcare resource allocation. Improving the prediction for rare codes ensures comprehensive and equitable representation of all diagnoses, leading to more precise patient data and better-informed clinical and administrative decisions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the automated generation of accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from clinical text (e.g., discharge summaries). Specifically, it applies AI to overcome data scarcity issues for rare medical conditions by generating high-quality synthetic clinical notes. This enhances the equity and performance of AI models (transformer-based models like PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD) in predicting a comprehensive range of medical codes, thus improving automated diagnostic coding, clinical decision support, and medical data analysis.</p>

                    <p>The proposed data-centric framework generates synthetic discharge summaries by first creating structured prompts. These prompts are designed around rare ICD codes and enriched using real-world co-occurrence patterns of ICD codes, detailed ICD descriptions, medical synonyms, taxonomic relationships within the ICD hierarchy, and content extracted from similar existing clinical notes. Using these prompts, 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes were generated to expand the training distribution. Subsequently, two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, were fine-tuned on this augmented dataset (original + synthetic notes).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and completeness of automated ICD coding systems, particularly for patients with less common or rare conditions. This translates to more accurate medical records, streamlined billing processes, improved epidemiological surveillance of rare diseases, and more efficient healthcare resource allocation. By enhancing the 'equity' of code prediction, it ensures that all conditions, regardless of their prevalence, are accurately documented, reducing the burden on human coders and leading to more reliable health data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.</p>
