                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Optimal Transport-based framework to synthesize counterfactual treatment group data for a target site, overcoming challenges of cross-site heterogeneity in treatment effects. By leveraging full treatment and control data from a source site alongside control data from the target, the method learns a push-forward transformation to generate a synthetic target treatment distribution. This approach robustly recovers the full distributional properties of treatment effects, departing from conventional average treatment effect estimation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is crucial for enhancing the generalizability of clinical research findings across diverse patient populations and settings, a significant hurdle in evidence-based medicine. It allows for more precise predictions of treatment responses in new cohorts without requiring full trials, thereby accelerating drug development and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research develops an advanced statistical machine learning framework (using Optimal Transport for distributional causal inference) that can be applied to healthcare data. Specifically, it can be used to: 1) generalize findings from clinical trials conducted in one population to predict treatment outcomes in a different, heterogeneous patient population; 2) accelerate drug discovery and development by enabling more robust predictions of drug efficacy in preclinical models (like patient-derived xenografts) or new patient cohorts; 3) inform personalized medicine by modeling the full distribution of treatment effects, helping identify patient subgroups that may respond differently; and 4) assist in evidence synthesis for healthcare decision-making by intelligently integrating data from various sources.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose a novel framework for synthesizing counterfactual treatment group data in a target site by integrating full treatment and control group data from a source site with control group data from the target. Departing from conventional average treatment effect estimation, our approach adopts a distributional causal inference perspective by modeling treatment and control as distinct probability measures on the source and target sites. We formalize the cross-site heterogeneity (effect modification) as a push-forward transformation that maps the joint feature-outcome distribution from the source to the target site. This transformation is learned by aligning the control group distributions between sites using an Optimal Transport-based procedure, and subsequently applied to the source treatment group to generate the synthetic target treatment distribution. Under general regularity conditions, we establish theoretical guarantees for the consistency and asymptotic convergence of the synthetic treatment group data to the true target distribution. Simulation studies across multiple data-generating scenarios and a real-world application to patient-derived xenograft data demonstrate that our framework robustly recovers the full distributional properties of treatment effects.</p>
