                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces PAVE, the first end-to-end benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating the real behavioral safety of production autonomous vehicles (AVs). Collected entirely in autonomous-driving mode from real-world AVs, PAVE provides a rich, continuously expanding resource for analyzing AV driving behavior and ensuring their safety in diverse scenarios, unlike previous datasets primarily used for early perception and prediction training.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The PAVE dataset was collected in the real world using multiple production autonomous vehicles operating in their autonomous-driving mode. Over 100 hours of naturalistic driving data were processed into 32,727 key frames. Each frame was enriched with synchronized multi-camera images, high-precision GNSS/IMU data, and manual 2D annotations of surrounding objects. Additionally, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories (past 6s, future 5s) and detailed scenario attributes (e.g., area type, weather, traffic density) were extracted. An end-to-end motion planning model was then applied to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness in predicting vehicle trajectories for safety evaluation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the successful creation and initial validation of the PAVE dataset, which stands as the first benchmark collected entirely in autonomous-driving mode from production AVs. The abstract demonstrates the dataset's practical utility by showing that it can support an end-to-end motion planning model that achieves an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 meters for trajectory prediction on autonomous-driving frames, indicating its suitability for rigorous safety evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The development of PAVE has significant potential clinical impact by enabling the creation and validation of increasingly safe autonomous driving systems. This directly translates to a reduction in the incidence of traffic-related injuries and fatalities, alleviating the burden on emergency rooms, trauma centers, and long-term rehabilitation facilities. Furthermore, safer AVs can improve mobility and access to healthcare for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or individuals with disabilities, thus enhancing overall patient care and quality of life.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the limitations of *existing* datasets (human-driving or unidentified modes) which PAVE aims to overcome. While PAVE is extensive, as a dataset, it represents a specific sample of real-world scenarios and AV models, and may not fully capture all possible edge cases or extreme conditions required for absolute safety guarantees. The presented 1.4m ADE, while a good baseline for a motion planning model, still represents a margin of error that needs continuous reduction for clinical-grade safety performance in all driving situations.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The authors explicitly state that the PAVE dataset is continuously expanding with over 10 hours of new data added weekly. This ongoing expansion provides a sustainable foundation for future research, which is expected to focus on deeper analysis of autonomous vehicle driving behavior, robust safety evaluation methodologies, and continuous improvement of AV perception, prediction, and motion planning models to achieve higher levels of safety and reliability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.</p>
