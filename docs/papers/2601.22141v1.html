                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that generates multiple specialized subnetworks, or 'adaptive tickets', tailored to specific classes, semantic clusters, or conditions within heterogeneous datasets. RTL consistently outperforms traditional single and multi-model baselines in accuracy and recall, while drastically reducing parameter count, offering a novel approach to align model structure with inherent data diversity.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Medical data is inherently heterogeneous (e.g., varying patient populations, imaging protocols, disease manifestations, genetic profiles). This framework enables more robust and efficient AI models that can adapt to specific medical contexts or patient subgroups without requiring multiple full-sized models, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and computational efficiency in healthcare applications.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The proposed 'Routing the Lottery' framework could significantly enhance medical AI applications by creating more efficient and adaptable models. For instance, in medical imaging, it could allow a single AI model to adapt to different scanner types, image resolutions, or patient populations, providing more reliable diagnoses across diverse clinical settings while requiring fewer computational resources. In personalized medicine, it could enable models to specialize in specific patient subgroups or disease presentations, leading to more tailored treatment recommendations. Its ability to improve balanced accuracy and recall is crucial for detecting rare diseases or critical anomalies in imbalanced medical datasets. The efficiency gains (fewer parameters) would also facilitate deployment on edge devices for point-of-care diagnostics or wearables.</p>

It achieves these performance gains while significantly reducing model complexity, using up to 10 times fewer parameters than a set of independent models.

                <p>This research could lead to more accurate, reliable, and computationally efficient AI models in medicine. For instance, in medical imaging, one AI model could dynamically adapt its underlying structure to different scanner types, patient demographics, or disease stages, improving diagnostic consistency. In personalized medicine, it could create tailored predictive models for specific genetic variations or patient cohorts without the overhead of maintaining many large, independent models, facilitating more precise clinical decision-making and resource allocation.</p>

                <p>While the abstract highlights the identification of 'subnetwork collapse' as a phenomenon to be addressed in aggressive pruning, it does not explicitly state limitations of the RTL framework itself. Further research would be needed to understand the computational overhead of routing and training multiple subnetworks, and its generalization to extremely complex, multi-modal medical datasets with highly granular heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.</p>
