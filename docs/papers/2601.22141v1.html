                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that moves beyond the traditional Lottery Ticket Hypothesis by discovering multiple specialized subnetworks, or 'adaptive tickets,' tailored to specific data characteristics like classes or semantic clusters. RTL consistently outperforms baselines, significantly reduces model parameters, and identifies 'subnetwork collapse' with a novel diagnostic tool, thereby promoting more modular and context-aware deep learning architectures.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Medical data is profoundly heterogeneous, encompassing diverse patient demographics, disease subtypes, imaging modalities, and clinical contexts. RTL offers a solution to build more accurate, efficient, and robust AI models capable of adapting to this variability, potentially improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning without the need for multiple, resource-intensive models.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research could enable the development of more efficient, robust, and personalized AI systems for various health applications. For instance, an AI model for diagnosing a disease could leverage this framework to adapt its internal structure to different patient groups, imaging protocols, or clinical sites, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and generalizability. It could also facilitate context-aware AI for personalized treatment planning, drug discovery by adapting to diverse chemical spaces, or for biosecurity applications by handling heterogeneous surveillance data more effectively. The reduced parameter count also makes these models more suitable for deployment on point-of-care devices or in environments with limited computational resources.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework designed to discover multiple specialized subnetworks ('adaptive tickets'). These subnetworks are tailored to specific data partitions such as classes, semantic clusters, or environmental conditions. Performance was evaluated against single- and multi-model baselines using metrics like balanced accuracy and recall across diverse datasets. The methodology also includes the identification of 'subnetwork collapse' and the introduction of a novel 'subnetwork similarity score' for label-free diagnosis of oversparsification.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>RTL consistently demonstrated superior balanced accuracy and recall compared to traditional single- and multi-model baselines. It achieved significant parameter efficiency, using up to 10 times fewer parameters than maintaining independent models. The framework successfully discovered semantically aligned subnetworks. A novel finding was 'subnetwork collapse' under aggressive pruning, for which a 'subnetwork similarity score' was developed as a label-free diagnostic tool. Overall, the work suggests pruning can be a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>RTL could enable the deployment of highly performant and resource-efficient AI models in healthcare, particularly for tasks involving heterogeneous patient data or complex medical conditions. This can lead to more precise diagnostics (e.g., differentiating rare disease subtypes), personalized treatment recommendations, and improved prognostic models. The significant parameter reduction facilitates AI integration into constrained clinical environments, while the subnetwork similarity score enhances model reliability by identifying and mitigating performance degradation due to aggressive pruning, which is crucial for safety-critical medical applications.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations inherent to the RTL framework itself. However, it identifies 'subnetwork collapse' as a performance drop observed under aggressive pruning, which implies a general challenge in pruning that RTL's subnetwork similarity score aims to diagnose and mitigate, rather than a direct limitation of RTL.</p>

This could include further exploration of dynamic routing mechanisms for adaptive tickets, optimizing strategies for data partitioning and subnetwork specialization, and extensive application and validation across an even wider array of complex, unseen heterogeneous medical datasets to fully leverage its potential in precision health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.</p>
