                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Routing the Lottery (RTL) is an adaptive pruning framework that addresses the limitation of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis by discovering multiple specialized subnetworks, called "adaptive tickets," tailored to heterogeneous data characteristics. This approach consistently outperforms traditional single- and multi-model baselines in accuracy and recall while significantly reducing parameter count and revealing semantically aligned model structures. The work introduces new concepts like subnetwork collapse and a similarity score for diagnosing oversparsification.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Healthcare data is notoriously heterogeneous, encompassing diverse patient demographics, disease presentations, imaging modalities, and clinical contexts. RTL provides a powerful mechanism to create highly specialized and efficient AI models that can adapt to this variability, leading to more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and personalized treatment recommendations across different patient populations or disease subtypes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research could lead to more robust, efficient, and accurate AI models for various medical applications. For example, in medical imaging, specialized subnetworks could be trained for different MRI protocols, patient demographics, or types of lesions, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy across a diverse patient population. In personalized medicine, models could adapt to individual patient profiles or specific disease subtypes (e.g., different cancer mutations). The reduction in parameter count would facilitate the deployment of advanced AI on edge devices (e.g., wearables, portable diagnostic tools) or in resource-constrained healthcare settings. The 'label-free diagnosis of oversparsification' could also be adapted to identify model performance issues in medical AI without requiring extensive manual labeling of ground truth.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework designed to identify and train multiple specialized subnetworks (adaptive tickets). This framework explicitly targets data heterogeneity by tailoring subnetworks to specific data characteristics (e.g., class, semantic cluster, environmental condition). They evaluated RTL's performance against single-model and multi-model baselines across diverse datasets and tasks, measuring metrics like balanced accuracy, recall, parameter reduction, and semantic alignment of the discovered subnetworks. They also introduced a subnetwork similarity score to diagnose performance degradation under aggressive pruning.</p>

                    <p>RTL consistently achieved superior performance in balanced accuracy and recall compared to traditional single- and multi-model baselines. It demonstrated significant model efficiency, reducing parameter count by up to 10 times compared to training independent models. The discovered subnetworks were found to be semantically aligned with the data characteristics they specialized in. Additionally, the study identified a phenomenon termed "subnetwork collapse" under aggressive pruning and proposed a "subnetwork similarity score" as a diagnostic tool for this issue.</p>

                <p>This research could lead to the development and deployment of more robust, efficient, and specialized AI models in clinical settings. Instead of a single, generalized model, healthcare AI could leverage context-aware subnetworks optimized for specific patient populations, disease subtypes, or diagnostic tasks, improving accuracy and reliability. This also facilitates deploying AI on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing model size while maintaining or improving performance, thereby enabling wider adoption of AI tools in hospitals and clinics for personalized and precise medical applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.</p>
