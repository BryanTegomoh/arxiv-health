                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper establishes an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks for individuals vulnerable to eating disorders (EDs), highlighting how current safeguards are insufficient for subtle clinical cues. Through qualitative analysis of interviews with ED specialists, the research identifies seven critical risk categories, demonstrating how AI interactions can exacerbate ED features and intensify user harm.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for mental health and digital medicine as it systematically identifies serious, unaddressed risks posed by generative AI to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Understanding these risks is vital for developing clinically informed safeguards that protect patient well-being and prevent the exacerbation of severe psychiatric conditions through digital interactions.</p>

                <p>This research analyzes the potential negative impacts and risks of generative AI systems when interacting with individuals suffering from or vulnerable to eating disorders. While not an 'application' in the sense of a positive therapeutic tool, it examines how AI, when used by or presented to individuals, can influence health outcomes in a medical context, thus directly falling under the purview of AI in health/medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative AI systems may pose serious risks to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.</p>
