                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the serious risks generative AI systems pose to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders, noting that existing safeguards are inadequate as they overlook subtle but clinically significant cues. Through semi-structured interviews with 15 eating disorder experts and abductive qualitative analysis, the authors developed a seven-category taxonomy of AI-related risks to understand how specific user interactions intersect with clinical features of eating disorders.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative AI systems may pose serious risks to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.</p>
