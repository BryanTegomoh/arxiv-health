                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Pancakes introduces a novel framework for multi-protocol image segmentation in biomedical domains, enabling automatic generation of diverse and semantically consistent segmentations from a single image. It addresses the limitation of existing models that either support only one protocol or require manual prompting, and is capable of processing images from previously unseen domains. The framework significantly outperforms existing foundation models in generating multiple plausible and coherent segmentation maps.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A single biomedical image can be meaningfully segmented in multiple ways, depending on the desired application. For instance, a brain MRI can be segmented according to tissue types, vascular territories, broad anatomical regions, fine-grained anatomy, or pathology, etc. Existing automatic segmentation models typically either (1) support only a single protocol, the one they were trained on, or (2) require labor-intensive manual prompting to specify the desired segmentation. We introduce Pancakes, a framework that, given a new image from a previously unseen domain, automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols, while maintaining semantic consistency across related images. Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images.</p>
