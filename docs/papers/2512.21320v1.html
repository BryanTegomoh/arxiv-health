                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation for pangenome analysis designed to overcome limitations of existing sequence-, path-, or sample-centric formats. H1 employs adaptive per-allele compression to encode exact haplotype membership, achieving near-optimal storage across all variant types, particularly for structural variations. A path-centric dual, H2, is also presented, maintaining full information equivalence while enabling explicit haplotype ordering for downstream applications.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This novel representation dramatically improves the scalability and efficiency of analyzing population-scale pangenomes, crucial for deciphering complex genetic architectures of diseases, identifying disease-associated variants (especially rare ones), and accelerating the development of targeted therapies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself describes a data representation and computational method rather than an AI application, it provides a critical 'population-aware foundation' for downstream applications where AI/machine learning is heavily utilized. For instance, AI algorithms could leverage the H1/H2 pan-graph-matrix representation to:
1.  **Rare-variant interpretation:** Train machine learning models to predict the pathogenicity or clinical significance of novel rare variants more accurately by efficiently processing comprehensive pangenomic data.
2.  **Drug discovery:** Utilize AI to identify novel drug targets or biomarkers by analyzing complex genetic variation patterns across large populations, potentially leading to more effective and personalized therapies.
3.  **Pharmacogenomics:** Develop AI models to predict individual responses to drugs, including efficacy and adverse effects, based on a more complete and scalable representation of their genomic profile.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.</p>
