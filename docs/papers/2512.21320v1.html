                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces H1 and H2, novel allele-centric and path-centric pangenome representations, respectively, designed for scalable analysis across large cohorts by unifying single-nucleotide and structural variations. These representations achieve substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, through adaptive per-allele compression, while maintaining exact information equivalence to traditional pangenome graphs.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself introduces a novel data structure and compression method, its stated purpose is to provide a 'unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis'. This scalability is critical for applying AI and machine learning methods to large-scale genomic data. Specifically, it enables more effective AI applications in areas like rare-variant interpretation (e.g., using AI to predict variant pathogenicity or prioritize disease-causing mutations) and drug discovery (e.g., AI-driven target identification, drug repurposing, or personalized drug response prediction based on genomic insights).</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.</p>
