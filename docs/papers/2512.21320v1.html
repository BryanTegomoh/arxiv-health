                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces H1, an allele-centric pan-graph-matrix, and its dual H2, a path-centric representation, designed to enhance scalability and efficiency in population-scale pangenome analysis. By utilizing adaptive per-allele compression and treating alleles as first-class objects, these representations achieve significant storage compression, especially for structural variants, while retaining full information equivalence to pangenome graphs. This novel approach provides a unified, population-aware foundation critical for advanced genomic applications.</p>

                    <p>The authors developed two novel data structures: the H1 pan-graph-matrix (allele-centric) and its H2 dual representation (path-centric). H1 employs an adaptive per-allele compression algorithm that optimizes encoding based on the carrier distribution of alleles to store exact haplotype membership. The efficacy of these representations was evaluated using real human genome data, demonstrating compression gains (especially for structural variants) and confirming information equivalence to existing pangenome graph formats.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.</p>
