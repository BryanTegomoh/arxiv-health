                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>zkFL-Health is an architectural protocol that enhances Federated Learning (FL) by integrating Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Clients train models locally and commit their updates. An aggregator processes these updates within a TEE to ensure confidentiality during the global update computation. The TEE then generates a succinct ZKP (using Halo2/Nova) that cryptographically proves the correctness of the aggregation logic and the use of committed inputs, without exposing the raw client updates. Verifier nodes validate these proofs, and cryptographic commitments are recorded on a blockchain, establishing an immutable audit trail and distributed trust.</p>

It finds that the architecture can prevent privacy leakage from model updates and eliminate the need to trust a central aggregator, ensuring aggregation integrity through ZKPs. The system is designed to provide strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, addressing critical barriers to multi-institutional medical AI adoption and regulatory compliance.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>zkFL-Health has the potential to revolutionize medical AI development by allowing healthcare institutions to securely pool their data's 'knowledge' without ever sharing raw patient information. This will lead to the creation of more robust, accurate, and generalizable AI models for diagnostics, treatment optimization, and patient care. The built-in auditability and privacy guarantees are crucial for satisfying regulatory bodies and fostering trust among clinicians and patients, accelerating the integration of AI into clinical workflows.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While addressing critical limitations of prior FL approaches, the abstract describes a proposed architecture and its guarantees rather than empirical results. The mention of a 'performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost' suggests that the practical overheads (computational cost of ZKPs, latency of TEEs and blockchain interactions) are yet to be fully quantified and optimized for real-world medical AI deployments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.</p>
