                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the concept of "hyperdisorder" to describe a distinct architectural regime in tumor growth, characterized by spatially nonstationary, multiscale disorder that persists or amplifies with increasing observation scale. Analyzing H&E whole-slide images of gastric cancer, the study demonstrates that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual tumors, suggesting growth-driven multiscale incoherence.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The computational framework developed for quantifying tumor architecture (hyperdisorder index) from whole-slide images of H&E stained tissues provides valuable features that could be integrated into medical AI applications. Specifically, AI models in computational pathology could utilize this hyperdisorder index and its multiscale components for more robust cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response. The framework's ability to clarify the representativeness of tissue samples could enhance the reliability and generalizability of AI-driven diagnostic tools by accounting for spatial nonstationarity and scale-dependent effects within tumors.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework offers critical insights for clinical practice by clarifying when measurements derived from limited tissue samples (e.g., biopsies) are truly representative of the entire tumor, and conversely, when they are significantly influenced by specific scale- and location-dependent architectural effects. This can lead to more accurate diagnostic interpretations and potentially inform more precise treatment strategies based on a better understanding of tumor heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Tumor growth is constrained by spatial, mechanical, and metabolic factors whose alignment progressively breaks down across cellular, mesoscopic, and tissue scales as tumors expand. We hypothesize that this misalignment drives tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased heterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the same tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, disorder here persists, reorganizes, or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a stable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture using tile-based metrics that capture complementary aspects of organization, including texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation, orientation isotropy, and multiscale entropy variation. These measures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial regions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. Testable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to converge, and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this framework clarifies when measurements from limited tissue samples are representative of the whole tumor and when they are dominated by scale- and location-dependent effects.</p>
