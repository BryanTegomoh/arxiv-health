                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study comparatively analyzes low-compute rule-based NLP methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting structured medical insights from Polish Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It finds that rule-based methods offer higher accuracy for demographic data like age and sex, while LLMs provide greater adaptability, scalability, and excel in drug name recognition, even considering translation-induced information loss. The paper advocates for hybrid NLP approaches to achieve reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.</p>
