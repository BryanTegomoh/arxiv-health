                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MergeSlide introduces a novel framework for lifelong learning on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) by treating it as a model merging problem leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. It enables continuous integration of new cancer-related tasks through class-aware prompts, brief fine-tuning, and an orthogonal merging strategy, while employing a unique Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference for class-incremental settings. The framework significantly outperforms existing continual learning and zero-shot baselines on TCGA datasets, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MergeSlide functions by framing lifelong learning as a model merging process built upon a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new cancer-related task becomes available, it undergoes a three-step integration: 1) The task is explicitly defined using class-aware prompts. 2) The foundation model's backbone is fine-tuned for a limited number of epochs, utilizing an MLP-free architecture to retain generalization. 3) The fine-tuned model for the new task is merged into a pre-existing unified model via an orthogonal continual merging strategy, specifically designed to prevent performance degradation and mitigate catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. For inference in a class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) scenario where the specific task for an input WSI is unknown, the Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference strategy is employed. TCP first uses task-level prompts to identify the most relevant task from the model's learned repertoire, then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts of that identified task to generate the final predictions. The framework was evaluated experimentally on a sequential stream of six TCGA datasets.</p>

                <p>MergeSlide has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and adaptability of AI models in clinical digital pathology. By enabling models to continually learn new cancer types or adapt to evolving diagnostic criteria without complete retraining, it will reduce the computational and human resources required for model maintenance.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Lifelong learning on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) aims to train or fine-tune a unified model sequentially on cancer-related tasks, reducing the resources and effort required for data transfer and processing, especially given the gigabyte-scale size of WSIs. In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.
