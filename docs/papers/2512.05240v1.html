                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces IE2Video, a novel task for reconstructing full RGB video sequences from a hybrid input of a single initial RGB keyframe and subsequent continuous event camera data. The aim is to enable low-power, continuous video monitoring for systems like wearables by reducing conventional RGB camera capture, then reconstructing the standard video offline. The authors demonstrate that adapting pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, specifically LTX, with event data injection via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation significantly outperforms autoregressive baselines in perceptual quality.</p>

                    <p>The study proposes a hybrid capture strategy using sparse RGB keyframes and continuous event streams. It defines the IE2Video task.

For the diffusion model, event representations were injected through learned encoders and fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Performance was evaluated using LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) for perceptual quality and validated across multiple event camera datasets (BS-ERGB, HS-ERGB far/close) at various sequence lengths.</p>

                <p>This research could revolutionize continuous patient monitoring by enabling truly long-duration, low-power video capture for medical wearables (e.g., fall detection, activity tracking, gait analysis). It facilitates unobtrusive monitoring in home or clinical settings, providing rich visual data for diagnostics and progress tracking in rehabilitation without frequent battery changes. For robotic systems in healthcare (e.g., assistive robots, surgical assistants), it offers a more power-efficient visual perception system, extending operational times or allowing for more compact designs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Continuous video monitoring in surveillance, robotics, and wearable systems faces a fundamental power constraint: conventional RGB cameras consume substantial energy through fixed-rate capture. Event cameras offer sparse, motion-driven sensing with low power consumption, but produce asynchronous event streams rather than RGB video. We propose a hybrid capture paradigm that records sparse RGB keyframes alongside continuous event streams, then reconstructs full RGB video offline -- reducing capture power consumption while maintaining standard video output for downstream applications. We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). We validate our approach across three event camera datasets (BS-ERGB, HS-ERGB far/close) at varying sequence lengths (32-128 frames), demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization with strong performance on unseen capture configurations.</p>
