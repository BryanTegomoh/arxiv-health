                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces NuClass, a novel deep learning framework designed to overcome limitations in cell annotation from histopathology images by integrating multi-scale information. NuClass combines detailed nuclear morphology with broader microenvironmental context using an adaptive, uncertainty-aware fusion mechanism. Evaluated on a new, high-quality spatial transcriptomics-derived dataset, NuClass achieves significantly improved performance, enabling robust and interpretable cell-level phenotype prediction.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>NuClass employs a deep learning architecture with two main processing streams: 'Path local' for 224x224 pixel crops focusing on nuclear morphology, and 'Path global' for 1024x1024 pixel neighborhoods capturing microenvironmental context. These streams are integrated via a learnable gating module that adaptively weighs their contributions. An uncertainty-guided objective function is used to encourage complementary learning, prioritizing global context where local information is ambiguous. For interpretability, calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations are generated. The model was trained and evaluated on a custom-built, marker-guided dataset derived from Xenium spatial transcriptomics, offering single-cell resolution labels for over two million cells across 8 organs and 16 classes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Identifying cell types and subtypes from routine histopathology images is essential for improving the computational understanding of human disease. Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability.
  To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction.</p>
