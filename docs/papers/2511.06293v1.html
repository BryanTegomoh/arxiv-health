                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a "fairness-without-harm" machine learning approach to address the critical trade-off between achieving fairness and maintaining high predictive performance, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare. The method involves learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying "demographic experts" – consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers – through a no-harm constrained selection mechanism. Evaluations on three real-world medical datasets (eye disease, skin cancer, X-ray diagnosis) and two face datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in ensuring fairness without degrading predictive accuracy for any specific demographic group.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into
human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining
high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques
often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading
performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like
clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable.
In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct
representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying
demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and
personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate
our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin
cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving
fairness without harm.</p>
