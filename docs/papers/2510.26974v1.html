                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MEDIQA-OE 2025, the inaugural shared task focused on extracting actionable medical orders from doctor-patient consultations, a critical step towards automating clinical documentation. Six participating teams explored diverse methodologies, including both closed- and open-weight large language models, to address the challenge of converting spoken interactions into structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) entries. The paper details the task, dataset, final leaderboard, and the innovative solutions developed by the participants.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Automating medical order extraction directly addresses clinician burnout by reducing manual documentation time, thereby allowing more focus on patient care. This technology is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of Electronic Health Records, ensuring timely and appropriate patient management.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical documentation increasingly uses automatic speech recognition and
summarization, yet converting conversations into actionable medical orders for
Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can
significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact
downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first
challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six
teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of
approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In
this paper, we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking,
and participants' solutions.</p>
