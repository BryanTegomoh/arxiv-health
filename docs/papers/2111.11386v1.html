                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel immuno-epidemiological vector-host model that integrates within-host virus-immune interactions with population-level disease dynamics, addressing a critical gap in traditional epidemic modeling. By applying Sensitivity Analysis to this multiscale model, the researchers quantify the impact of immunological parameters on key epidemiological quantities like the basic reproduction number (R0) and host infectiousness, using Rift Valley Fever Disease as a case study. The findings demonstrate that small increases in within-host pathogen growth can lead to significant increases in population-scale disease prevalence, emphasizing the importance of within-host control strategies.</p>

                    <p>The authors developed a novel age-since-infection structured vector-host model. Within this framework, population-level epidemiological parameters (e.g., infectiousness, recovery rates) were formulated as dynamic functions dependent on within-host virus and antibody densities, which were themselves governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) was then applied to this integrated multiscale model to quantify the impact of specific within-host immunological parameters on population-level disease metrics such as R0, final epidemic size, and host infectiousness. Rift Valley Fever Disease (RVFD) was used as a case study, with parameters estimated from existing literature.</p>

                    <p>The study's primary findings include that a mere 1% increase in the within-host pathogen growth rate can lead to an 8% increase in the basic reproduction number (R0). Furthermore, this 1% increase can also contribute to a 1% increase in the steady-state abundance of infected hosts and a 4% increase in the infectiousness of hosts during an outbreak when R0 is greater than one. These findings highlight the disproportional and significant influence of within-host dynamics on population-level disease spread.</p>

                <p>The research suggests that clinical and public health interventions focusing on reducing within-host pathogen growth, even by small percentages, could have a profound impact on curtailing epidemic spread and disease prevalence. This supports the development of new drug therapies, vaccine strategies, or immunomodulatory treatments designed to limit viral replication or pathogen burden at the individual level, thereby significantly reducing R0 and the overall burden of infectious diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sensitivity Analysis (SA) is a useful tool to measure the impact of changes in model parameters on the infection dynamics, particularly to quantify the expected efficacy of disease control strategies. SA has only been applied to epidemic models at the population level, ignoring the effect of within-host virus-with-immune-system interactions on the disease spread. Connecting the scales from individual to population can help inform drug and vaccine development. Thus the value of understanding the impact of immunological parameters on epidemiological quantities. Here we consider an age-since-infection structured vector-host model, in which epidemiological parameters are formulated as functions of within-host virus and antibody densities, governed by an ODE system. We then use SA for these immuno-epidemiological models to investigate the impact of immunological parameters on population-level disease dynamics such as basic reproduction number, final size of the epidemic or the infectiousness at different phases of an outbreak. As a case study, we consider Rift Valley Fever Disease (RFVD) utilizing parameter estimations from prior studies. SA indicates that 1% increase in within-host pathogen growth rate can lead up to 8% increase in R0; up to 1% increase in steady-state infected host abundance, and up to 4% increase in infectiousness of hosts when the reproduction number R0 is larger than one. These significant increases in population-scale disease quantities suggest that control strategies that reduce the within-host pathogen growth can be important in reducing disease prevalence.</p>
