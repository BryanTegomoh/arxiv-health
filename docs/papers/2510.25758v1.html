                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>TheraMind has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy and personalization of AI-assisted psychological counseling. By enabling more adaptive, emotionally aware, and continuous therapeutic interactions over multiple sessions, it could improve patient engagement, adherence to therapeutic plans, and ultimately, treatment outcomes. This advancement could provide scalable, robust support for individuals needing mental health services, acting as a valuable tool for therapists or even a standalone digital therapeutic in resource-limited settings.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation noted (or inferred from the abstract's context) is that the validation of TheraMind was conducted in a high-fidelity simulation environment, rather than through direct clinical trials with human patients. While grounded in real clinical cases, the step to real-world clinical application and empirical validation with diverse patient populations remains a future endeavor.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.</p>
