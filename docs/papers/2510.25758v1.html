                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">TheraMind introduces a novel strategic and adaptive AI agent for longitudinal psychological counseling, addressing critical limitations of current large language models such as lack of emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and multi-session memory. Its core innovation is a dual-loop architecture that separates tactical dialogue management from strategic therapeutic planning, enabling superior performance in simulated multi-session clinical scenarios. This design allows for dynamic response selection based on patient emotions and long-term adaptation of therapeutic methods.</p>

                    <p>TheraMind employs a novel 'dual-loop architecture'. The 'Intra-Session Loop' is responsible for real-time tactical dialogue, perceiving patient emotional states, dynamically selecting response strategies, and utilizing cross-session memory. The 'Cross-Session Loop' handles strategic therapeutic planning, evaluating the efficacy of applied therapy after each session and adaptively adjusting methods for subsequent interactions. The agent was validated through extensive evaluations in a 'high-fidelity simulation environment' developed from 'real clinical cases'.</p>

                <p>TheraMind has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by offering an advanced AI tool that can provide more personalized, consistent, and adaptivetherapeutic support over multiple sessions. This could extend the reach of mental health services, provide supplemental support to human therapists, and enhance treatment adherence and outcomes, particularly in underserved populations or as part of digital therapeutic platforms.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation noted is that the validation was conducted in a 'high-fidelity simulation environment' grounded in real clinical cases, rather than in actual clinical trials with human patients. While robust, simulation environments cannot fully replicate the complexities and nuances of real-world human-therapist interactions, implying that further validation with human subjects is necessary.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.</p>
