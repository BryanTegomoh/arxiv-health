                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with computational image analysis to achieve non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas. By extracting semantic attributes and quantitative features from multi-parametric MRI and tumor segmentations, serializing them into JSON, and querying advanced LLMs like GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning, the method demonstrated high accuracy and balanced classification performance across diverse cohorts. The research highlights the potential for LLM-driven reasoning to revolutionize neuro-oncology diagnostics through precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational
image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status
in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and
multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable
semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a
standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning.
We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and
results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across
heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5
outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric
features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by
subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results
demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational
image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing
diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology. The code is available at
