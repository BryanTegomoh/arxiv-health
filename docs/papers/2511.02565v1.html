                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a novel hierarchical decoding framework designed for subject-agnostic brain visual decoding from fMRI data. VCFlow models the human visual system's ventral-dorsal architecture and employs a contrastive learning strategy to reconstruct continuous visual experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training. This approach offers a fast (10 seconds per video), clinically scalable solution, sacrificing only 7% accuracy on average compared to conventional, computationally intensive methods.</p>

                    <p>VCFlow successfully reconstructs continuous visual experiences from fMRI for previously unseen subjects without requiring subject-specific training. It generates each reconstructed video in approximately 10 seconds, a substantial improvement over conventional methods.

                <p>VCFlow offers a rapid and clinically scalable solution for brain visual decoding, significantly reducing the data collection burden and computational resources typically associated with fMRI-based reconstructions. Its subject-agnostic nature makes it directly applicable to diverse patient populations, potentially enabling faster diagnosis, enhancing communication for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments through novel brain-computer interfaces, and facilitating rehabilitation strategies where individualized, extensive training data is impractical.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.</p>
