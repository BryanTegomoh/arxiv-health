                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a novel hierarchical framework for subject-agnostic brain visual decoding that reconstructs continuous visual experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training. By explicitly modeling the human visual system's ventral-dorsal architecture and employing feature-level contrastive learning, VCFlow achieves fast (10 seconds per video), clinically scalable reconstruction with minimal accuracy sacrifice (7%) and no per-subject retraining.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>VCFlow is a hierarchical decoding framework that biologically models the human visual system's ventral-dorsal streams. It disentangles features from early visual cortex, ventral (object recognition) and dorsal (spatial processing) streams to capture diverse cognitive information. A feature-level contrastive learning strategy is integrated to extract subject-invariant semantic representations, improving cross-subject generalization without requiring individual subject training.</p>

                    <p>VCFlow successfully performs subject-agnostic brain visual decoding, reconstructing continuous visual experiences from fMRI data. It can generate reconstructed videos in 10 seconds each, without any retraining for new subjects, contrasting with conventional methods needing >12 hours of per-subject data and intensive computation. This efficiency is achieved with only a 7% average accuracy sacrifice.</p>

                <p>VCFlow offers a rapid, scalable, and practical solution for brain visual decoding, removing the barrier of extensive subject-specific data collection and computational retraining. This enables faster deployment in clinical settings, facilitating applications like assistive communication devices for locked-in patients, objective assessment of visual function in non-responsive individuals, or aiding in diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders affecting visual processing, thereby broadening its applicability to a wider patient population.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.</p>
