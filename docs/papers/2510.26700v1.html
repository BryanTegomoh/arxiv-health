                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This simulation study evaluated causal machine learning (ML) models' performance for individualized treatment effect (ITE) prediction under violations of the conditional exchangeability assumption. It demonstrated that Causal Forest and X-learner models fail to accurately estimate ITEs and can produce misleading heterogeneity signals when this crucial assumption is violated. The research validated negative control outcomes (NCOs) as an effective diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific unmeasured confounding, recommending their routine incorporation into causal ML workflows.</p>

                <p>The findings underscore the critical need for rigorous diagnostic checks, like NCOs, when utilizing causal ML models to inform individualized treatment decisions in clinical practice. Implementing NCOs in medical research and clinical data analysis workflows can significantly improve the reliability and credibility of personalized treatment recommendations, mitigating the risk of biased inferences and promoting safer, more effective patient care strategies.</p>

This implies a potential limitation in the diagnostic precision of NCOs under certain non-ideal conditions, suggesting that while valuable, their signal might require careful interpretation regarding the exact magnitude and location of confounding.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.</p>
