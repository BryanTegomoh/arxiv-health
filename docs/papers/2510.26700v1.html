                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper critically evaluates the performance of causal machine learning (ML) models, specifically causal forest and X-learner, in predicting individualized treatment effects (ITEs) when the crucial conditional exchangeability assumption is violated, a common issue in observational studies. Through a simulation study, it demonstrates that such violations lead to inaccurate ITE estimates and even false indications of heterogeneity, while successfully establishing negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a valuable empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific unmeasured confounding.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a simulation design to evaluate the performance of causal forest and X-learner models.

They underscore the need for rigorous empirical diagnostics like NCOs to ensure the credibility of individualized treatment effect estimates, especially when guiding personalized therapeutic strategies. Incorporating NCOs into clinical ML workflows can help mitigate the risks of biased recommendations, leading to more reliable and safer patient care derived from observational data.</p>

                <p>While the abstract highlights limitations of current practices, a nuanced limitation within the study's findings is that NCOs, despite being informative, did not always perfectly pinpoint the subgroup with the largest confounding. Additionally, as a simulation study, its findings need to be validated against the full complexity and diversity of real-world routinely collected observational data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.</p>
