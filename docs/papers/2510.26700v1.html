                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated the performance of causal machine learning models (causal forest, X-learner) for individualized treatment effect (ITE) prediction under violations of the conditional exchangeability assumption, revealing their failure to accurately estimate ITEs and sometimes falsely indicating heterogeneity. It demonstrated the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a crucial empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific unmeasured confounding, even when NCO ideal assumptions are not perfectly met.</p>

                <p>This research provides a crucial practical tool for clinicians and health researchers developing or implementing causal ML models for personalized medicine. By integrating NCOs as a diagnostic, potential biases due to unmeasured confounding can be detected, preventing erroneous individualized treatment recommendations and increasing the credibility and safety of AI-driven clinical decision support systems.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation for causal ML models highlighted is their substantial sensitivity to violations of the conditional exchangeability assumption, which can lead to invalid or misleading individualized treatment effect estimates. While NCOs are a valuable diagnostic, the study notes that even when their ideal assumptions are not perfectly met, they might not always precisely pinpoint the subgroup with the largest confounding, requiring nuanced interpretation. As a simulation study, its findings need further validation in diverse real-world observational datasets.</p>

                <p>The study strongly recommends the routine incorporation of negative control outcomes (NCOs) into causal machine learning workflows to empirically diagnose subgroup-specific unmeasured confounding and enhance the credibility of individualized inferences. Future research could focus on practical implementation guidelines for NCOs in diverse clinical settings, further validation across different causal ML methodologies and real-world datasets, and exploring methods to refine NCO-based identification of the most severely confounded subgroups.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.</p>
