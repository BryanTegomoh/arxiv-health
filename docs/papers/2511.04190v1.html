                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the effectiveness of covariance descriptors, which capture second-order image statistics, for medical image classification, particularly when integrated with SPDNet, a classification network designed for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. The authors propose constructing these descriptors from features extracted by powerful pre-trained General Vision Encoders (GVEs) like DINOv2 and MedSAM. Their findings demonstrate that GVE-derived covariance descriptors consistently outperform handcrafted alternatives, and critically, the combination of SPDNet with DINOv2 features achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on diverse medical image datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.</p>
