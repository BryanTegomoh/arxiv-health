                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, implicit limitations include the study's focus on a specific LEP demographic (Spanish-speaking) and participant group (patient navigators), which may limit generalizability. The use of hypothetical storyboard scenarios, rather than real-world AI interactions, might also present different challenges upon actual implementation.</p>

                <p>Future research should focus on developing and evaluating AI tools incorporating the identified design considerations (rapport-building, education, language support, minimal disruption). Further investigation into strategies for mitigating structural factors like technology access and digital literacy, as well as exploring direct patient perspectives on AI, are also warranted.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Limited English proficiency (LEP) patients in the U.S. face systemic barriers
to healthcare beyond language and interpreter access, encompassing procedural
and institutional constraints. AI advances may support communication and care
through on-demand translation and visit preparation, but also risk exacerbating
existing inequalities. We conducted storyboard-driven interviews with 14
patient navigators to explore how AI could shape care experiences for
Spanish-speaking LEP individuals. We identified tensions around linguistic and
cultural misunderstandings, privacy concerns, and opportunities and risks for
AI to augment care workflows. Participants highlighted structural factors that
can undermine trust in AI systems, including sensitive information disclosure,
unstable technology access, and low digital literacy. While AI tools can
potentially alleviate social barriers and institutional constraints, there are
risks of misinformation and uprooting human camaraderie. Our findings
contribute design considerations for AI that support LEP patients and care
teams via rapport-building, education, and language support, and minimizing
disruptions to existing practices.</p>
