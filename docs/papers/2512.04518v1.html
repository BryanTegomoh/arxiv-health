                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper details UW-BioNLP's approach to the ChemoTimelines 2025 shared task, focusing on automatically generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes using advanced LLM systems. Their method employs a two-step workflow: LLMs extract chemotherapy events from individual notes, followed by algorithmic normalization and aggregation into patient-level timelines. A fine-tuned Qwen3-14B model achieved the best official score of 0.678, demonstrating the efficacy of combining thinking, fine-tuning, and dictionary-enhanced strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology follows a two-step process: (1) Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to extract specific chemotherapy events (e.g., drug, dosage, start/end dates) from unstructured individual clinical notes. The LLM's performance was optimized through strategies such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and integrating dictionary-based lookups. (2) An algorithmic component then normalizes the extracted events for consistency (e.g., standardizing drug names, resolving temporal ambiguities) and aggregates them chronologically to construct comprehensive patient-level chemotherapy timelines.</p>

The evaluation of different LLM strategies confirmed that a combination of sophisticated prompting (CoT), task-specific fine-tuning (SFT, DPO), and knowledge-based enhancements (dictionary lookup) significantly improves the accuracy of event extraction from clinical text.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients. This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded competitive performances on the test set leaderboard, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the best official score of 0.678. Our results and analyses could provide useful insights for future attempts on this task as well as the design of similar tasks.</p>
