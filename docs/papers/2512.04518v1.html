                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study implemented a two-stage pipeline: (1) An LLM component was responsible for identifying and extracting chemotherapy events from individual raw clinical notes. Various LLM configurations were tested, including those employing Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and dictionary-based lookup mechanisms to guide extraction. (2) Subsequently, an algorithmic component processed these extracted events, performing normalization and aggregation to construct a coherent patient-level chemotherapy timeline.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients. This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded competitive performances on the test set leaderboard, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the best official score of 0.678. Our results and analyses could provide useful insights for future attempts on this task as well as the design of similar tasks.</p>
