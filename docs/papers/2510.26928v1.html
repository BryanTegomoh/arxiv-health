                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper critically analyzes the significant discrepancies observed between experimental measurements and Monte-Carlo simulations concerning hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields (g-values) in water irradiated at ultra-high dose-rates (UHDR), a key aspect of the FLASH effect. It reviews existing literature, covering diverse experimental setups and simulation methodologies, to pinpoint potential causes for these contradictions and advocate for the development of testable, mechanistic models to resolve the issue.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Resolving the inconsistencies in radiation chemistry, particularly H2O2 yields at ultra-high dose-rates, is paramount for fully understanding the underlying mechanisms of the FLASH effect. This understanding is critical for the safe and effective clinical implementation of FLASH radiotherapy, aiming to enhance cancer treatment efficacy while significantly reducing side effects on healthy tissues.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper discusses Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS) as a tool for predicting hydrogen peroxide yields. While MCS is a computational method, the abstract does not describe its use as a 'medical AI' application in the typical sense (e.g., machine learning for diagnosis, drug discovery, or treatment planning optimization). It focuses on the fundamental physics discrepancies within these simulations rather than the application of AI techniques to health data or processes. Thus, no direct AI application is described in the abstract.</p>

This necessitates moving beyond purely descriptive observations towards creating testable hypotheses and refining both experimental and simulational approaches to reconcile the existing discrepancies in H2O2 yield data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Radiation chemistry of model systems irradiated with ultra-high dose-rates
(UHDR) is key to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the sparing of healthy
tissue, which is called the FLASH effect. It is envisioned to be used for
efficient treatment of cancer by FLASH radiotherapy. However, it seems that
even the most simple model systems, water irradiated with varying dose-rates
(DR), pose a challenge. This became evident, as differences within measured and
predicted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields (g-values) for exposure of liquid
samples to conventional DR and UHDR were reported. Many of the recently
reported values contradict older experiments and current Monte-Carlo
simulations(MCS). In the present work, we aim to identify possible reasons of
these discrepancies and propose ways to overcome this issue. Hereby a short
review of recent and classical literature concerning experimental and
simulational studies is performed. The studies cover different radiation
sources, from gamma rays, high-energy electrons, heavy particles (protons and
ions) with low and high linear energy transfer (LET), and samples of hypoxic &
oxygenated water, with cosolutes such as bovine-serum albumine (BSA). Results
are for additional experimental parameters, such as solvent, sample container
and analysis methods used to determine the respective g-values of H2O2.
Similarly the parameter of the MCS by the step-by-step approach, or the
independent-reaction time (IRT) method are discussed. Here, UHDR induced
modification of the radical-radical interaction and dynamics, not governed by
diffusion processes, may cause problems. Approaches to test these different
models are highlighted to allow progress: by making the step from a purely
descriptive discourse of the effects observed, towards testable models, which
should clarify the reasons of how and why such a disagreement came to light in
the first place.</p>
