                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents an interpretable decision support framework for sepsis treatment in intensive care units (ICUs). The system integrates patient risk stratification, synthetic data augmentation, an offline reinforcement learning agent for treatment recommendations, and a multi-modal large language model (LLM) for generating clinical justifications. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, the approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing robust and interpretable policy recommendations to clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in ICUs, where timely and precise treatment decisions are paramount for patient survival and outcomes. This research offers an intelligent, interpretable decision support tool that can assist critical care clinicians in making more accurate, safer, and explainable treatment choices, potentially reducing sepsis-related morbidity and mortality.</p>
