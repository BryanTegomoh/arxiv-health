                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous multisource transfer learning framework that utilizes model averaging to address the challenges of Positive-Unlabeled (PU) data, particularly in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis, where labeled negative samples are scarce. By integrating knowledge from fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU datasets through tailored logistic regression models and optimally weighted averaging, the method achieves superior predictive accuracy and robustness. Crucially, it accomplishes this without direct data sharing, overcoming privacy and data scarcity constraints.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is highly relevant to medicine as it directly tackles the pervasive issue of scarce labeled negative samples in medical diagnosis and research, where ethical, privacy, and cost constraints often limit data availability. It enables the development of robust predictive models using readily available heterogeneous data sources without compromising patient privacy.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research proposes an AI/ML framework (transfer learning with model averaging for PU data) that can enhance the accuracy and robustness of diagnostic models in medicine. It is particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining explicit negative labels for diseases is difficult or impossible, where medical data is scarce, or where privacy concerns restrict direct data sharing between different healthcare institutions. This can lead to more effective AI tools for disease detection and patient stratification.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning presents unique challenges due to the lack of explicitly labeled negative samples, particularly in high-stakes domains such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis. To address data scarcity and privacy constraints, we propose a novel transfer learning with model averaging framework that integrates information from heterogeneous data sources - including fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU data sets - without direct data sharing. For each source domain type, a tailored logistic regression model is conducted, and knowledge is transferred to the PU target domain through model averaging. Optimal weights for combining source models are determined via a cross-validation criterion that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish theoretical guarantees for weight optimality and convergence, covering both misspecified and correctly specified target models, with further extensions to high-dimensional settings using sparsity-penalized estimators. Extensive simulations and real-world credit risk data analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative methods in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness, especially under limited labeled data and heterogeneous environments.</p>
