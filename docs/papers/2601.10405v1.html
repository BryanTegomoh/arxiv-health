                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">A mathematical model reveals a `ping-pong` synergistic mechanism between Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Vaccinia Virus (VV) for oncolytic virotherapy, where VV's B18R protein neutralizes interferon-α, enhancing VSV replication and leading to accelerated tumor clearance. Optimal therapeutic outcomes are achieved through immediate VSV administration followed by a precisely timed delayed VV injection.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a crucial theoretical framework for designing more effective and precisely timed oncolytic virotherapy strategies, potentially transforming current approaches by maximizing therapeutic synergy and overcoming challenges of single-agent treatments, leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper develops a 'predictive model' for synergistic oncolytic virotherapy and performs 'temporal optimization' of treatment protocols. This falls under the application of computational intelligence and predictive analytics in medicine, which is a key aspect of medical AI. Specifically, it can be seen as a tool for personalized treatment planning, optimizing drug timing and dosing, and predicting therapeutic outcomes, thereby informing clinical decisions for cancer patients.</p>

                    <li>Numerical simulations demonstrated complete tumor clearance in approximately 50 days with the combined therapy, representing an 11% acceleration compared to VV monotherapy (56 days), while VSV alone failed to eradicate tumors.</li>

                    <p>The study employed a dynamic mathematical model to simulate the complex interactions between tumor cells, VSV, VV, and the interferon-α immune response.

                    <p>The primary discovery is the `ping-pong` synergistic mechanism, where VV-produced B18R protein effectively counteracts interferon-α, creating a more permissive environment for enhanced VSV replication and subsequent tumor lysis. This synergy results in complete tumor clearance in 50 days, outperforming monotherapies, and is optimally achieved by immediate VSV administration followed by VV injection within 1 to 19 days.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present a mathematical model that describes the synergistic mechanism of combined Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Vaccinia Virus (VV). The model captures the dynamic interplay between tumor cells, viral replication, and the interferon-mediated immune response, revealing a `ping-pong' synergy where VV-infected cells produce B18R protein that neutralizes interferon-$α$, thereby enhancing VSV replication within the tumor. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this combination achieves complete tumor clearance in approximately 50 days, representing an 11\% acceleration compared to VV monotherapy (56 days), while VSV alone fails to eradicate tumors. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical thresholds for viral burst size and B18R inhibition, while sensitivity analysis highlights infection rates and burst sizes as the most influential parameters for treatment efficacy. Temporal optimization reveals that therapeutic outcomes are maximized through immediate VSV administration followed by delayed VV injection within a 1-19 day window, offering a strategic approach to overcome the timing and dosing challenges inherent in OVT.</p>
