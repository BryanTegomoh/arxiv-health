                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) against supervised methods for fine-grained, lesion-level identification of incidentalomas requiring follow-up directly from radiology reports. The study demonstrates that generative LLMs, especially an anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model with structured lesion tagging, significantly outperform traditional supervised baselines and achieve performance comparable to human experts, paving the way for reliable automated incidental finding surveillance.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the automated detection and classification of incidental findings (incidentalomas) within radiology reports. Specifically, it aims to identify those incidentalomas that require further medical follow-up, thereby assisting radiologists in prioritizing cases, reducing diagnostic errors, and streamlining patient care pathways.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The research utilized a comparative experimental design, evaluating three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). A dataset of 400 annotated radiology reports containing 1,623 verified lesion findings was employed. A novel inference strategy incorporated lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to enhance LLM reasoning and grounding. Model performance was quantitatively assessed using class-specific F1-scores, and statistical significance was determined for observed performance gains.</p>

                    <p>Generative LLMs, particularly the anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b, achieved superior performance in lesion-level incidentaloma detection (macro-F1 of 0.79) compared to all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1 of 0.70). This performance was comparable to human inter-annotator agreement (0.76). Explicit anatomical grounding statistically significantly improved GPT-based models' performance (p < 0.05), and an ensemble method further boosted the macro-F1 to 0.90.

                <p class="abstract">Objective: To evaluate large language models (LLMs) against supervised baselines for fine-grained, lesion-level detection of incidentalomas requiring follow-up, addressing the limitations of current document-level classification systems.
  Methods: We utilized a dataset of 400 annotated radiology reports containing 1,623 verified lesion findings. We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores.
  Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions.
  Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts. This approach offers a reliable, interpretable pathway for automated incidental finding surveillance in radiology workflows.</p>
