                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MultiTypeFCDD, a lightweight convolutional framework designed for explainable multi-type anomaly detection, addressing the crucial limitation of current methods that identify anomalies without differentiating their specific types. By using only image-level labels, MultiTypeFCDD generates multi-channel heatmaps where each channel corresponds to a unique anomaly type, functioning as a single, unified model across multiple object categories. It achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art complex models while significantly reducing computational load and inference times, making it practical for real-world applications with constrained resources.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.</p>
