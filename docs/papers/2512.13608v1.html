                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), developed using self-supervised pre-training on an unprecedented dataset of over 25 million DBT slices. The model demonstrated strong performance in breast density classification and 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, showcasing the value of domain-specific pre-training for these tasks. However, its performance on general lesion detection showed variable benefits compared to an ImageNet-pretrained baseline, suggesting areas for further methodological development.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved self-supervised pre-training of the DBT-DINO model using the DINOv2 methodology on an exceptionally large dataset of over 25 million 2D slices derived from DBT volumes. The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned and evaluated on three downstream clinical tasks: breast density classification (using 5,000 exams), 5-year breast cancer risk prediction (using 106,417 exams), and lesion detection (using 393 annotated volumes). Performance was compared against a MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (pre-trained on ImageNet) and DenseNet-121.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>DBT-DINO achieved superior performance in breast density classification (0.79 accuracy) over baselines. For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, it showed strong performance (0.78 AUROC), comparable to the DINOv2 baseline. In lesion detection, while DINOv2 demonstrated higher average sensitivity (0.67), DBT-DINO exhibited a slightly better detection rate for cancerous lesions specifically (78.8%). The domain-specific pre-training benefits varied, being pronounced for classification tasks but less consistent for general localized detection.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>DBT-DINO could enable more accurate and automated assessment of breast density, a critical factor in breast cancer risk and screening recommendations. Its ability to predict 5-year breast cancer risk with high accuracy could facilitate earlier identification of high-risk individuals, allowing for personalized screening strategies or preventive measures. While lesion detection requires further improvement, its potential for better identifying cancerous lesions could assist radiologists in clinical decision-making.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study found that the domain-specific pre-training of DBT-DINO did not consistently outperform the ImageNet-pretrained DINOv2 baseline for general lesion detection. For both 5-year risk prediction and lesion detection, the p-values (p=.57 and p=.60 respectively) suggest no statistically significant difference between DBT-DINO and DINOv2, indicating that the advantage of domain-specific pre-training is not universal across all tasks or for all types of lesions.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The authors suggest that localized detection tasks, particularly in the context of foundation models for 3D medical imaging, require further methodological development. This implies future research should focus on optimizing architectures or fine-tuning strategies to better leverage domain-specific pre-training for precise object detection.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Foundation models have shown promise in medical imaging but remain underexplored for three-dimensional imaging modalities. No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening.
  To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training.
  Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes.
  For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%.
  Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.</p>
