                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>GMFVAD operates by first generating 'grained multi-modal features' from video snippets to capture the main content and reduce inherent visual redundancy. Subsequently, it incorporates external text features, extracted from the original video captions, to specifically enhance and refine the visual features associated with 'highlighted portions' of the video. This targeted enhancement, guided by textual information, focuses the detection on truly anomalous events by suppressing irrelevant visual noise.</p>

                    <p>The GMFVAD framework demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across four major video anomaly detection datasets. Crucially, comprehensive ablation studies confirmed that the observed performance improvement is directly attributable to the method's effectiveness in reducing redundant information within the extracted multi-modal features.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability of GMFVAD to reduce redundancy and focus on 'highlighted portions' can lead to more accurate, reliable, and interpretable anomaly detection systems in healthcare. This can significantly reduce false alarms, making systems more practical for continuous monitoring of patients (e.g., detecting falls, seizures, self-harm, agitation), surgical procedures (e.g., unusual movements, unexpected complications), or critical infrastructure. Improved accuracy and reduced false positives can enable earlier intervention, enhance patient safety, and optimize resource allocation in clinical settings.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, a potential practical limitation for medical applications is the reliance on 'captions of original video' for text features. Generating accurate and relevant captions in real-time for diverse medical surveillance scenarios might be challenging or infeasible. The computational cost and real-time inference capabilities for deployment in live clinical environments are also not discussed.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.</p>
