                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel pipeline for analyzing spontaneous speech in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, demonstrating that language models (LMs) can identify AD based purely on underlying semantic information, independent of surface-level textual patterns. By transforming speech texts to alter syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantics, the study shows that LM classifiers maintain similar performance, highlighting their ability to detect genuine semantic impairment. This work addresses the limited interpretability of LMs and opens new avenues for early, robust AD detection.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work significantly advances the potential for objective and interpretable early detection of Alzheimer's Disease by demonstrating that AI models can identify subtle, deeper semantic impairments indicative of cognitive decline, rather than relying on potentially misleading surface linguistic features. This precision could lead to more accurate and reliable screening tools, enabling timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a novel pipeline for transforming spontaneous speech texts from linguistic assessment tasks (e.g., picture description). This pipeline systematically alters the syntax and vocabulary of the text while explicitly preserving its semantic content. The effectiveness of these surface-level modifications and semantic preservation was validated using quantitative metrics: BLEU and chrF scores for surface dissimilarity, and semantic similarity scores for meaning retention. Language model-based classifiers were then evaluated on both the original and the transformed texts, comparing classification performance via macro-F1 scores. Additionally, the impact of image-based transformations, which aimed to reconstruct the original image from the speech description, on classification accuracy was investigated.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Language models can effectively detect Alzheimer's Disease based predominantly on underlying semantic information derived from spontaneous speech, even when the surface forms (syntax and vocabulary) are significantly varied. The proposed transformation successfully decoupled semantic content from surface form, as indicated by low BLEU/chrF scores and high semantic similarity. Classification performance (macro-F1) for AD detection remained largely consistent between original and semantically preserved, surface-transformed texts, showing only minor deviations. However, image-based transformations introduced substantial noise, adversely affecting classification accuracy. The research confirms that identifiable semantic impairment, an often-overlooked aspect of linguistic deterioration in AD, is detectable by LMs.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to lead to the development of more robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant AI-powered screening tools for Alzheimer's Disease. By enabling AI models to identify genuine semantic markers of cognitive decline, it offers a pathway for earlier and more accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely therapeutic interventions and patient management. It also enhances trust in AI diagnostic aids by providing evidence that predictions are based on deep linguistic indicators rather than superficial textual patterns.</p>

While the core method maintained similar performance, the mention of "small deviations in macro-F1" could imply that perfect semantic isolation or retention is challenging, or that surface form does contribute some minimal, non-spurious information.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely affects cognitive abilities. Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems.</p>
