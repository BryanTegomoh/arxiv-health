                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework designed for individualized resource allocation, specifically addressing challenges like delayed feedback, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints in high-stakes domains like healthcare. The framework optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations at a meta-level for fairness and operational constraints, while a base-level uses a neural network with delay kernels to identify the most responsive individuals. Validated on real-world datasets, the approach demonstrates higher cumulative outcomes, better adaptation to delay structures, and equitable resource distribution.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research applies a bi-level contextual bandit framework, incorporating neural networks, to optimize the individualized allocation of limited resources within healthcare settings. It aims to identify the most responsive individuals or subgroups for specific interventions or treatments, manage resource distribution (e.g., hospital beds, medical personnel, treatments, vaccines), and make adaptive decisions that account for delayed outcomes, fairness constraints, and dynamic patient populations. This could lead to more equitable and effective health policies and treatment strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology is a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework. The 'meta-level' employs an optimization strategy to allocate budgets at the subgroup level, ensuring compliance with fairness and operational constraints. Concurrently, the 'base-level' utilizes a neural network, trained on observational data, to identify the most responsive individuals for resource allocation within each subgroup. This base level incorporates specific mechanisms for handling delayed treatment effects through resource-specific delay kernels and respects cooldown windows, with the entire system designed for continuous policy refinement as new data become available.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.</p>
