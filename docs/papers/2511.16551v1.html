                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to generate valid synthetic clinical trial data, specifically focusing on complex time-to-event (survival) outcomes alongside mixed-type covariates. Addressing limitations of existing generative AI methods like GANs, the VAE operates within a unified latent framework, does not assume independent censoring, and outperforms baselines in fidelity, utility, and privacy for scenarios like data sharing and control-arm augmentation. While revealing systematic miscalibration in generated survival data, the authors propose a post-generation selection procedure that significantly improves calibration, marking a step forward in generative survival modeling for clinical research.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and health as it offers a solution to make clinical trials, especially in areas like oncology and rare diseases, more efficient, cost-effective, and less dependent on large, hard-to-recruit patient populations. By generating high-fidelity synthetic control arms, it can accelerate drug development and facilitate data sharing while maintaining privacy.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the generation of synthetic clinical trial data, specifically control arms and time-to-event (survival) outcomes, using generative AI models (VAEs). This aims to improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy of medical clinical trials, facilitate data sharing, and address issues like patient recruitment and group imbalances in medical research.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves developing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) specifically designed for the joint generation of mixed-type covariates and time-to-event (survival) outcomes. This VAE operates within a unified latent variable framework and does not assume independent censoring. The model's performance was evaluated against GAN-based baselines across synthetic and real clinical trial datasets. Evaluation metrics focused on fidelity, utility, and privacy in two specific use cases: data sharing (synthetic data as a proxy) and control-arm augmentation (balancing treatment groups). A post-generation selection procedure was also developed and assessed to improve the statistical calibration of the generated survival data.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The VAE model significantly outperforms existing GAN-based generative methods in fidelity, utility, and privacy for generating complex clinical trial data, including survival endpoints. However, a critical discovery was the systematic miscalibration of type I error and statistical power within the generated survival data. This miscalibration, if unaddressed, could lead to incorrect conclusions from synthetic trials. A subsequent post-generation selection procedure was shown to successfully improve this calibration.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has the potential to profoundly impact clinical trials by enabling faster, more cost-effective, and ethical drug development, particularly for conditions with small or fragmented patient populations (e.g., rare diseases, specific cancer subtypes). It can facilitate the use of synthetic control arms, reducing the need for large patient cohorts, accelerating enrollment, and lowering trial costs. It also offers a pathway for privacy-preserving data sharing and can improve trial design by allowing for augmentation of control groups to balance baseline characteristics.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>Existing generative approaches (GANs) are noted as data-hungry, unstable, and reliant on strong assumptions like independent censoring. While the proposed VAE addresses some of these, a significant limitation revealed by the study is the systematic miscalibration of type I error and power in the generated survival outcomes, even with the advanced VAE. This necessitates a post-generation selection procedure to achieve reliable statistical properties, indicating that perfectly calibrated, raw synthetic survival data remains an open challenge.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The paper explicitly highlights "open challenges for generative survival modeling," implying further research is needed to inherently improve the statistical calibration of generated time-to-event data without requiring post-processing. Future work could focus on developing generative models that are intrinsically more robust to miscalibration, exploring different architectures or loss functions tailored to survival statistics, and further validating these methods across a wider range of clinical trial designs and disease contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.</p>
