                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to generate synthetic clinical trial data, specifically addressing the complex task of modeling time-to-event survival outcomes alongside mixed-type covariates. The VAE operates within a unified latent variable framework and uniquely does not assume independent censoring, outperforming existing GAN-based approaches on fidelity, utility, and privacy, while identifying and partially mitigating critical miscalibration issues in type I error and power.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture. This VAE is specifically engineered to jointly model and generate both discrete/continuous covariates (mixed-type) and time-to-event survival outcomes. It uses a unified latent variable framework to capture the complex dependencies between these data types, explicitly designed to handle censoring without assuming independence. The model's performance was benchmarked against GAN-based baselines using synthetic and real clinical trial datasets, assessed by fidelity, utility, privacy metrics, and statistical properties like type I error and power calibration.</p>

A critical discovery was the systematic miscalibration of type I error and power in studies utilizing synthetic data, which was subsequently improved by a proposed post-generation selection procedure, demonstrating the feasibility but also the existing validity challenges of generative survival modeling.</p>

                <p>This technology has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by enabling faster and more cost-effective clinical trials through the creation of synthetic control arms, reducing the number of patients required for trials, and facilitating data sharing for research. It could accelerate the development of new treatments for cancer and rare diseases, improve the statistical power of studies with limited patient populations, and enhance data privacy when sharing clinical trial information.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.</p>
