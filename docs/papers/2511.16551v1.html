                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating synthetic clinical trial data, specifically addressing the complex challenge of time-to-event outcomes with censoring. The VAE jointly models mixed-type covariates and survival data without assuming independent censoring, outperforming GAN baselines in fidelity, utility, and privacy for data sharing and control-arm augmentation scenarios.</p>

                    <p>The authors developed a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to jointly generate mixed-type patient covariates (e.g., demographic, clinical features) and time-to-event survival outcomes. This VAE operates within a unified latent variable framework, allowing for complex dependencies between covariates and survival, crucially without making the restrictive assumption of independent censoring, which is a common limitation in survival analysis and prior generative models like GANs. The model's performance was evaluated against GAN baselines using fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics on both synthetic and real trial datasets.</p>

                    <p>The VAE-based generative model consistently outperformed existing GAN baselines across metrics of data fidelity (how closely synthetic data resembles real data), utility (how well models trained on synthetic data perform), and privacy. A critical finding was the identification of systematic miscalibration of statistical metrics, specifically type I error and power, when using the generated survival data. This issue was partially mitigated by a novel post-generation selection procedure, which improved the calibration of these statistical properties.</p>

                <p>This methodology has the potential to significantly impact clinical trial efficiency by enabling the creation of synthetic control arms, thereby reducing the need for extensive real patient enrollment, lowering trial costs, and accelerating drug development. It is particularly valuable for conditions with small or fragmented patient populations, such as rare diseases and specific oncology indications, where obtaining sufficient real control data is challenging. The ability to share synthetic data also improves data utility under strict privacy constraints.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.</p>
