                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigated biomechanical predictors of aortic expansion in uncomplicated Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) using reduced-order fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. It found that structural stress is a significant predictor of both the rate and spatial location of aortic growth, outperforming traditional metrics like aortic diameter and other biomechanical factors like wall shear stress.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized baseline and follow-up CT images from 30 patients with uncomplicated TBAD. For each patient, a reduced-order Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis, specifically employing a forward penalty stress computation method, was performed on the baseline aortic geometry to derive biomechanical variables (structural stress, wall shear stress, and pressure). Aortic growth was quantified by registering baseline and follow-up aortic surfaces using nonrigid registration. Statistical analyses included mixed-effects linear and logistic regression to assess relationships between biomechanical variables and aortic growth rate, accounting for inter-patient variability. Group comparison analyses were performed to evaluate spatial distributions of these biomechanical variables along the dissected aorta between patient groups categorized by their aortic growth and optimal medical therapy (OMT) outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive association between structural stress and aortic growth rate (p = 0.0003), and a significant negative association for wall shear stress (WSS) (p = 0.0227). Logistic regression showed that structural stress had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7414 for predicting aortic growth, surpassing traditional diameter (0.6845), WSS (0.5953), and pressure (0.4991). Group comparisons further demonstrated significant regional differences in structural stress along the dissected aorta between groups with different growth outcomes and OMT, a finding not replicated by diameter, WSS, or pressure.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research introduces structural stress, derived from FSI analysis, as a superior biomechanical predictor for aortic growth in uncomplicated TBAD. Its ability to predict both the rate and spatial location of aortic expansion could significantly enhance clinical risk stratification models. This will enable clinicians to more accurately identify patients at higher risk of progressive dissection, thereby guiding individualized surveillance protocols or facilitating timely prophylactic thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), ultimately preventing adverse events and optimizing patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, potential limitations include the relatively small sample size (30 patients) which may affect generalizability, the use of a reduced-order FSI model potentially simplifying complex biomechanical interactions, and the study's focus solely on 'uncomplicated' TBAD, which limits applicability to more complex cases. The duration of follow-up for CT images was also not specified.</p>

                <p>The findings strongly support the integration of structural stress into advanced risk stratification models for patients with uncomplicated TBAD to identify those at higher risk of progression. Future research should involve developing and prospectively validating these models in larger, multi-center cohorts, and investigating the clinical utility of structural stress-guided therapeutic interventions (e.g., early TEVAR) to assess its impact on long-term patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate prediction of aortic expansion in uncomplicated type B aortic
dissection (TBAD) can help identify patients who may benefit from timely
thoracic endovascular aortic repair. This study investigates associations
between biomechanical predictors derived from reduced-order fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) analysis and aortic growth outcomes. Baseline and follow-up
CT images from 30 patients with uncomplicated TBAD were obtained. For each
patient, a reduced-order FSI analysis using the forward penalty stress
computation method was performed on the baseline geometry. Aortic growth was
quantified by registering baseline and follow-up surfaces using nonrigid
registration. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regression analyses were
performed to assess relationships between structural stress, wall shear stress
(WSS), pressure and growth rate while accounting for inter-patient variability.
Group comparison analyses were performed to evaluate spatial distributions of
these biomechanical variables along the dissected aorta between patient groups
categorized by optimal medical therapy (OMT) and aortic growth outcomes. Linear
regression revealed a positive association between structural stress and aortic
growth rate (p = 0.0003) and a negative association for WSS (p = 0.0227).
Logistic regression yielded area under the receiver operator characteristic
curve (AUCs) of 0.7414, 0.5953, 0.4991, and 0.6845 for structural stress, WSS,
pressure, and aortic diameter, respectively. Group comparisons showed
significant regional differences in structural stress, but not in diameter,
WSS, or pressure, between groups defined by aortic growth and OMT outcomes.
These results indicate that structural stress is a promising predictor of both
the rate and location of aortic growth in uncomplicated TBAD, which supports
its use in risk stratification models to identify patients at higher risk of
TBAD progression.</p>
