                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose an approach for dynamic efficiency evaluation across multiple
organizational dimensions using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The method
generates both dimension-specific and aggregate efficiency scores, incorporates
desirable and undesirable outputs, and is suitable for large-scale problem
settings. Two regularized DEA models are introduced: a slack-based measure
(SBM) and a linearized version of a nonlinear goal programming model (GP-SBM).
While SBM estimates an aggregate efficiency score and then distributes it
across dimensions, GP-SBM first estimates dimension-level efficiencies and then
derives an aggregate score. Both models utilize a regularization parameter to
enhance discriminatory power while also directly integrating both desirable and
undesirable outputs. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and validity
of our approach on multiple datasets and apply it to a case study of twelve
hospitals in Ontario, Canada, evaluating three theoretically grounded
dimensions of organizational effectiveness over a 24-month period from January
2018 to December 2019: technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient
experience. Our numerical results show that SBM and GP-SBM better capture
correlations among input/output variables and outperform conventional
benchmarking methods that separately evaluate dimensions before aggregation.</p>
