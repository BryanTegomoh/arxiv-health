                    <p>The study introduces two regularized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models: a Slack-Based Measure (SBM) and a linearized Goal Programming SBM (GP-SBM). SBM calculates an aggregate efficiency score first and then disaggregates it across organizational dimensions, whereas GP-SBM first computes dimension-level efficiencies before aggregating them into an overall score. Both models incorporate a regularization parameter to improve discriminatory power and are designed to integrate both desirable and undesirable outputs directly. The methodology was tested for computational efficiency and validity using multiple datasets and applied to real-world hospital data.</p>

                    <p>The proposed SBM and GP-SBM models demonstrate computational efficiency and validity for large datasets. Crucially, they better capture complex correlations among input/output variables compared to traditional benchmarking methods. In the Ontario hospital case study, these models provided a more accurate and integrated assessment of technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient experience, outperforming conventional approaches that evaluate dimensions in isolation before aggregation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose an approach for dynamic efficiency evaluation across multiple
organizational dimensions using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The method
generates both dimension-specific and aggregate efficiency scores, incorporates
desirable and undesirable outputs, and is suitable for large-scale problem
settings. Two regularized DEA models are introduced: a slack-based measure
(SBM) and a linearized version of a nonlinear goal programming model (GP-SBM).
While SBM estimates an aggregate efficiency score and then distributes it
across dimensions, GP-SBM first estimates dimension-level efficiencies and then
derives an aggregate score. Both models utilize a regularization parameter to
enhance discriminatory power while also directly integrating both desirable and
undesirable outputs. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and validity
of our approach on multiple datasets and apply it to a case study of twelve
hospitals in Ontario, Canada, evaluating three theoretically grounded
dimensions of organizational effectiveness over a 24-month period from January
2018 to December 2019: technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient
experience. Our numerical results show that SBM and GP-SBM better capture
correlations among input/output variables and outperform conventional
benchmarking methods that separately evaluate dimensions before aggregation.</p>
