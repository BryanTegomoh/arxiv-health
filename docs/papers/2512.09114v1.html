                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper presents a conceptual, comprehensive operational framework (AI TIPS 2.0) that is an update to a previously developed model (2019). It implicitly utilizes a problem-solution approach by identifying critical gaps in existing AI governance frameworks and proposing AI TIPS 2.0 as a systematic, actionable solution designed to integrate trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings articulated are that existing AI governance frameworks are inadequate for use-case specific risk assessment, lack actionable technical controls, and fail to support scalable operationalization of trustworthy AI. This inadequacy has led to real-world harm, such as improper healthcare claim denials due to biased and error-prone AI. AI TIPS 2.0 is presented as a novel solution capable of addressing these deficiencies by enabling tailored governance and systematic integration of trustworthy AI.</p>

                <p>Implementing the AI TIPS 2.0 framework could significantly improve the reliability, fairness, and safety of AI systems in healthcare. It has the potential to prevent patient harm stemming from biased or erroneous AI in areas like diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and administrative decisions (e.g., insurance claims), thereby fostering trust in AI technologies within clinical and administrative settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.</p>
