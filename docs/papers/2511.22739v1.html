                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation in computational pathology (CPath) to address domain shifts caused by variations in clinical data. DIPT learns domain-invariant continuous prompts by averaging domain-specific input tokens, enabling a student model to distill knowledge from a pathology-tuned Vision-Language Model (PLIP) and align visual features with these robust embeddings. The method significantly improves the F1-score for domain generalization in histopathology datasets, paving the way for more robust CPath model deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.</p>
