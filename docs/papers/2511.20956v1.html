                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework that generates reports by first extracting structured descriptors and radiomics features from BUS images. It uses a multi-head Swin encoder to learn visual representations, which are specifically trained to be descriptor-aware through a multitask loss applied over dataset-specific descriptor sets. Report generation is then guided by these representations. A dual-level objective function aligns visual and textual tokens: a token-level cross-entropy loss for text generation and a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations, crucially operating without direct paired image-report supervision.</p>

                    <p>The study found that BUSTR consistently improved both standard natural language generation (NLG) metrics and clinical efficacy metrics across two distinct public BUS datasets (BrEaST and BUS-BRA). Significant improvements were particularly noted for critical diagnostic targets such as the BI-RADS category and pathology reports, validating the model's ability to generate clinically relevant and accurate information without relying on paired image-report training data.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>BUSTR has the potential to significantly reduce radiologist workload by automating and standardizing breast ultrasound reporting, leading to increased reporting consistency and potentially reducing diagnostic errors and inter-reader variability. By providing accurate, descriptor-aware reports, it could accelerate diagnostic pathways for breast cancer and improve the overall quality and efficiency of care in breast imaging departments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.
