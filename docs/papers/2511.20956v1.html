                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">BUSTR introduces a novel multitask vision-language framework for automated breast ultrasound (BUS) report generation (RRG), addressing the critical challenges of scarce paired image-report datasets and potential large language model (LLM) hallucinations. It constructs reports using structured descriptors and radiomics features, learning descriptor-aware visual representations and aligning visual-textual tokens via a dual-level loss. This approach significantly improves both standard natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key diagnostic targets like BI-RADS and pathology, without requiring paired image-report supervision.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework. It employs a multi-head Swin encoder to learn descriptor-aware visual representations from breast ultrasound images, trained with a multitask loss over a set of structured clinical descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features. A dual-level objective function, comprising token-level cross-entropy and a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations, is used to align these visual features with textual tokens for report generation, crucially operating without direct paired image-report supervision.</p>

                    <p>The primary findings indicate that BUSTR effectively generates comprehensive breast ultrasound reports without needing paired image-report data. It consistently outperforms existing methods on standard natural language generation metrics and, more importantly, demonstrates significant improvements in clinical efficacy metrics, particularly in accurately identifying and reporting BI-RADS categories and pathology findings.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology has the potential to substantially impact clinical practice by automating a significant portion of breast ultrasound reporting, thereby improving radiologists' efficiency and reducing their workload. By standardizing report generation based on structured descriptors, it can minimize inter-radiologist variability, leading to more consistent diagnoses and treatment recommendations for breast lesions. The enhanced accuracy in predicting BI-RADS categories and pathology could also facilitate earlier and more precise patient management.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.
