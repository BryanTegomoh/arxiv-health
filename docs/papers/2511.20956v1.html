                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">BUSTR proposes a novel multitask vision-language framework for automated breast ultrasound (BUS) radiology report generation (RRG) that overcomes the critical limitation of requiring paired image-report datasets. By generating reports from structured descriptors and radiomics features, utilizing a descriptor-aware Swin encoder and a dual-level vision-language alignment loss, BUSTR significantly improves both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key diagnostic targets like BI-RADS classification and pathology.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it addresses a significant challenge in medical artificial intelligence: the automated, accurate, and reliable generation of radiology reports for breast ultrasound. By bypassing the need for extensive paired datasets and improving clinical efficacy, BUSTR has the potential to standardize reporting, reduce radiologist workload, and enhance the consistency and speed of breast cancer diagnosis and management.</p>

                    <li>**Multi-head Swin Encoder:** A multi-head Swin encoder is employed to learn robust, descriptor-aware visual representations, trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Dual-Level Alignment Loss:** Vision and language tokens are aligned via a sophisticated dual-level objective function that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Robust Evaluation:** The model was comprehensively evaluated on two distinct public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, demonstrating its adaptability and performance across varying data characteristics.</li>

                    <p>BUSTR consistently demonstrated improvements in both standard natural language generation (NLG) metrics and critical clinical efficacy metrics when evaluated on the BrEaST and BUS-BRA datasets. Significant enhancements were observed specifically for key clinical targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology.

                <p>This framework has substantial potential to enhance the efficiency and quality of breast ultrasound diagnostics. By automating the generation of comprehensive and accurate reports, it can significantly reduce radiologist workload, decrease reporting times, and improve the consistency of diagnostic conclusions. Its improved performance on critical clinical indicators like BI-RADS classification can lead to more precise risk stratification and timely patient management in breast cancer screening and diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.
