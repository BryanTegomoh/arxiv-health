                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the concept of "semantic confusion" to measure local inconsistency in safety-aligned LLM refusals, where models accept one phrasing of an intent but reject close paraphrases. It proposes a framework with novel token-level metrics and a 10k-prompt corpus, ParaGuard, to reveal hidden structures of inconsistency that global false-rejection rates often mask, offering a practical signal for developers to enhance LLM safety alignments.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In healthcare, where LLMs are increasingly deployed for sensitive tasks like patient education, clinical decision support, or drug information, inconsistent refusals based on minor phrasing differences can hinder critical information access, misinform users, or erode trust in AI-driven health tools, directly impacting patient care and clinical workflows. Ensuring that an LLM's safety mechanisms are consistently applied and do not arbitrarily block medically sound queries is paramount for reliable and ethical AI adoption in medicine.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research provides a critical methodology for evaluating and improving the safety, consistency, and trustworthiness of Large Language Models intended for use in medical and healthcare applications. By measuring 'semantic confusion' and enabling 'confusion-aware auditing', it helps developers ensure that medical AI systems based on LLMs provide reliable and sensible responses, avoid inconsistent refusals to patient queries or clinical questions, and maintain appropriate safety boundaries without unnecessarily hindering beneficial interactions. This is essential for deploying LLMs in sensitive areas like clinical assistance, patient communication, and medical research where reliability is paramount.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study defines "semantic confusion" as a failure mode and develops a framework to measure it. This involves creating ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters with fixed intent but varied surface forms. Three token-level, model-agnostic metrics (Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, Confusion Depth) are proposed, which compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors using token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. These metrics were applied in experiments across diverse LLM families and deployment guards.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The research found that relying solely on global false-rejection rates obscures significant local inconsistencies in LLM safety refusals. The proposed metrics revealed settings with globally unstable refusal boundaries and others with localized pockets of inconsistency. Notably, stricter refusal policies were not always correlated with increased semantic inconsistency. The study also demonstrated that confusion-aware auditing provides a practical and actionable signal to separate the frequency of refusals from their logical consistency.</p>

                <p>This research can lead to the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI tools for healthcare by ensuring consistent and sensible responses to medically relevant queries, regardless of subtle phrasing variations. It can prevent situations where patients or clinicians receive inconsistent safety warnings or blocked access to crucial information, thereby improving user experience, enhancing safety adherence, and fostering greater trust in AI-powered clinical applications. Developers can use these metrics to fine-tune LLMs, balancing safety with legitimate information access in sensitive medical contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Safety-aligned language models often refuse prompts that are actually harmless. Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce "semantic confusion," a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.</p>
