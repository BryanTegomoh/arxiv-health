                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Multi-context Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA) is a novel theoretical and algorithmic framework that generalizes PCA to systematically identify underlying factors explaining variation across *subsets* of contexts. Applied to gene expression data, MCPCA reveals shared axes of variation among cancer types and uncovers a specific axis whose variability (not mean) in tumor cells is associated with lung cancer progression, insights not achievable by traditional PCA methods. This framework offers a principled way to understand complex biological data across heterogeneous conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MCPCA is presented as a theoretical and algorithmic framework that extends Principal Component Analysis. It systematically decomposes data, collected across multiple contexts (e.g., different cancer types), to recover underlying factors (axes of variation) that are shared specifically across *subsets* of these contexts. This involves a novel approach to identify and disentangle shared variance components that are not necessarily universal across all contexts nor unique to individual ones, providing a more nuanced factor decomposition.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>MCPCA successfully identified axes of gene expression variation that are shared across distinct subsets of cancer types, suggesting common underlying biological pathways or regulatory mechanisms. A particularly significant finding in lung cancer involved the identification of an axis whose *variability* (rather than its mean expression level) within tumor cells was robustly associated with lung cancer progression. Crucially, the factors and relationships discovered by MCPCA, especially concerning shared variation across context subsets and specific variability-based associations with progression, were not found when using conventional PCA approaches (e.g., pooling data across all contexts or analyzing contexts separately).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>MCPCA has the potential to significantly enhance disease classification, refine prognostic markers by identifying subtle, context-dependent variations associated with disease progression, and uncover shared biological drivers across diverse patient cohorts or disease subtypes. This could lead to more precise diagnostic tools, stratified patient populations for clinical trials, and the development of more targeted therapies and personalized medicine strategies in oncology and other complex diseases characterized by molecular heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Principal component analysis (PCA) is a tool to capture factors that explain variation in data. Across domains, data are now collected across multiple contexts (for example, individuals with different diseases, cells of different types, or words across texts). While the factors explaining variation in data are undoubtedly shared across subsets of contexts, no tools currently exist to systematically recover such factors. We develop multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA), a theoretical and algorithmic framework that decomposes data into factors shared across subsets of contexts. Applied to gene expression, MCPCA reveals axes of variation shared across subsets of cancer types and an axis whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean, is associated with lung cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades. These axes are not found by combining data across contexts or by restricting to individual contexts. MCPCA is a principled generalization of PCA to address the challenge of understanding factors underlying data across contexts.</p>
