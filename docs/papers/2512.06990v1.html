                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The system is divided into two phases: diagnosis and treatment planning. The diagnosis phase uses a sequential decision-making framework with four classification models (CNNs and SVMs) to progressively categorize brain regions. The treatment planning phase employs a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system. This MARL system consists of three generative models: a Diffusion Model for predicting resection outcomes, a Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer for simulating tumor progression after radiotherapy over user-defined weeks, and another Diffusion Model for generating post-chemotherapy MRIs. A Convolutional Neural Network acts as a survival rate calculator to evaluate the generated post-treatment MRIs. If the predicted survival rate is not within 15% of a user-defined target, a feedback loop utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) iterates through the generative models to identify an optimal resection location.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Currently, there is a noticeable lack of AI in the medical field to support doctors in treating heterogenous brain tumors such as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the deadliest human cancer in the world with a five-year survival rate of just 5.1%. This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%. These results project to increase survival rates by 0.9%, potentially saving approximately 2,250 lives.</p>
