                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for the automatic and parallel optimization of 45 treatment planning parameters in intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) for head and neck cancers (HNC). The method successfully addresses the challenges of complex HNC planning and the limitations of prior deep learning and single-agent RL approaches, producing clinically competitive plans that significantly improve organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing compared to expert manual planning.</p>

                    <p>The MARL framework successfully tuned 45 treatment planning parameters simultaneously, producing IMCT plans for HNC that were comparable to or superior to expert manual plans (relative plan score: RL $85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$).

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This automated planning system has the potential to significantly streamline and standardize the complex process of IMCT planning for HNC, reducing the reliance on extensive expert experience and manual tuning. By consistently generating high-quality plans with superior OAR sparing, it can lead to reduced treatment toxicities, improved functional outcomes for patients (e.g., swallowing, speech), and an overall enhanced quality of life after cancer treatment, while also improving the accessibility and consistency of advanced carbon-ion therapy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.</p>
