                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the impact of time-step size on reinforcement learning (RL) models designed for sepsis treatment, challenging the conventional 4-hour data aggregation. Through controlled empirical experiments across four time-step sizes (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h), the study found that finer granularities (1h and 2h), particularly when employing a static behavior policy, yield superior and more stable treatment policies. The findings underscore the critical role of time-step size in offline RL for healthcare, advocating for a re-evaluation of current practices in sepsis management.</p>

                    <p>The study employed empirical experiments comparing four distinct time-step sizes ($Δt=1,2,4,8$ h) within an identical offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline. To ensure a fair comparison, action re-mapping methods were developed for evaluating policies across datasets with varying time-step sizes.

                    <p>Performance trends across different time-step sizes were found to be sensitive to the chosen learning setup. Specifically, policies trained using finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) in conjunction with a static behavior policy demonstrated superior overall performance and stability compared to coarser granularities. This suggests that the conventional 4-hour time step may not be optimal for capturing critical patient dynamics in sepsis.</p>

Adopting 1-hour or 2-hour time steps for RL model training could lead to more nuanced and responsive treatment policies, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of AI-driven clinical decision support systems and improving patient outcomes in sepsis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.</p>
