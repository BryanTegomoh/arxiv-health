                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the critical impact of time-step size on reinforcement learning (RL) models designed for sepsis treatment, challenging the conventional 4-hour data aggregation. Through controlled empirical experiments, it demonstrates that policies learned at finer time-step granularities (1h and 2h) consistently achieve superior and more stable performance, especially with a static behavior policy. The study advocates for a re-evaluation of time-step selection in offline RL for healthcare, moving beyond the established 4-hour setup to potentially develop more effective treatment strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The researchers performed controlled empirical experiments by comparing four time-step sizes (1, 2, 4, and 8 hours) within an identical offline reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. To facilitate fair cross-time-step comparison, they designed action re-mapping methods allowing policies to be evaluated on datasets with different granularities. Cross-Δt model selections were conducted under two distinct policy learning setups to analyze the influence of time-step size on various stages of the RL process, including state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation.</p>

                    <p>The study found that the performance trends across different time-step sizes were inconsistent and dependent on the specific learning setups employed. However, policies trained with finer time-step sizes, specifically 1-hour and 2-hour intervals, consistently achieved the best overall performance and stability, particularly when a static behavior policy was utilized during the learning process.</p>

                <p>This research has significant clinical implications, suggesting that AI-driven sepsis treatment policies developed using the conventional 4-hour data aggregation might be suboptimal. Implementing finer time-step sizes (e.g., 1 or 2 hours) in the development of future RL models for sepsis could lead to more responsive, precise, and effective treatment recommendations, potentially improving clinical decision-making, patient outcomes, and survival rates in critical care settings by capturing more nuanced patient physiological changes.</p>

However, the scope is focused on an 'identical offline RL pipeline' and 'static behavior policy' for its best results, which may not encompass all real-world complexities or dynamic patient responses that online or more adaptive RL approaches might address.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.</p>
