                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper empirically investigates the impact of time-step size in reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment, challenging the conventional 4-hour data aggregation. Through controlled experiments comparing 1, 2, 4, and 8-hour time steps, the study demonstrates that finer time-step sizes (1h and 2h) coupled with a static behavior policy yield superior and more stable performance. The work underscores time-step size as a critical design choice in offline RL for healthcare, advocating for the adoption of finer temporal resolutions in sepsis management.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a controlled, empirical comparison of four time-step sizes (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h) within an identical offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline. To ensure fair comparison, novel action re-mapping methods were designed for evaluating policies across datasets with varying temporal granularities. Cross-Δt model selections were conducted under two different policy learning setups to comprehensively assess the influence of time-step size on state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The performance trends of RL policies in sepsis management vary significantly depending on the time-step size and the specific policy learning setup. Crucially, policies trained using finer time-step sizes (1-hour and 2-hour) achieved superior overall performance and stability, particularly when combined with a static behavior policy. This finding strongly suggests that the conventional 4-hour time-step might be too coarse for optimal sepsis treatment policy learning.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides compelling evidence for clinicians and AI developers to reconsider the default 4-hour data aggregation in RL models for sepsis. Implementing RL policies derived from finer temporal data (e.g., 1 or 2-hour steps) could potentially lead to more accurate and responsive treatment recommendations, thereby improving patient outcomes in sepsis by better capturing dynamic physiological changes and allowing for earlier, more targeted interventions. It paves the way for developing more effective clinical decision support systems in critical care.</p>

                <p>The study implicitly suggests future work in exploring and implementing RL models for sepsis using finer time-step sizes (1h and 2h) beyond the conventional 4-hour setup in clinical practice. Further research could investigate how different policy learning setups interact with varying time-step sizes and validate these findings in larger, more diverse patient cohorts or real-time clinical deployment scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.</p>
