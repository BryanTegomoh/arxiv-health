                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces CA-GPT, a specialized RAG-enhanced AI model integrated into an AI-OCT system, demonstrating superior performance in OCT-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) planning and assessment. It significantly outperformed both the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in decision-making agreement when compared against expert-derived procedural records. The system offers a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, promising to augment operator expertise and optimize PCI outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Intravascular imaging, particularly OCT, is crucial for optimizing PCI outcomes, but its interpretation is highly operator-dependent, leading to variability. This research presents a domain-specific AI solution that can standardize complex OCT interpretation, potentially reducing human error, improving procedural precision, and democratizing access to expert-level guidance in interventional cardiology.</p>

                    <p>This was a single-center, comparative analysis involving 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI. The study compared procedural decisions generated by three distinct entities: the novel CA-GPT AI-OCT system, the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 model, and junior physicians. These decisions were then assessed for agreement against an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was quantified using ten pre-specified metrics, categorized into pre-PCI planning and post-PCI assessment phases, with statistical significance determined using appropriate tests (e.g., P-values for comparisons).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system holds significant potential to revolutionize decision-making in OCT-guided PCI. By providing highly standardized and reliable interpretation of complex intravascular images, it can mitigate operator-dependent variability, enhance the precision of stent selection and deployment, and optimize post-PCI assessment. This advancement could lead to improved procedural efficiency, enhanced patient safety, superior long-term clinical outcomes, and serve as an invaluable educational and decision-support tool for interventional cardiologists, particularly junior operators.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract explicitly notes this as a 'single-center analysis,' which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other institutions, diverse patient populations, or different OCT platforms. The use of an 'expert-derived procedural record' as the gold standard, while practical, could introduce subtle biases. Furthermore, the study focused on decision *agreement* rather than direct clinical outcomes, necessitating future trials to assess actual patient benefit.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly detailed in the abstract, logical future directions include conducting multi-center validation studies to confirm generalizability, performing prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate the direct impact of CA-GPT-guided PCI on hard clinical outcomes (e.g., MACE, revascularization rates). Further research could also focus on refining the CA-GPT model, integrating it with other patient data, and investigating its cost-effectiveness and seamless integration into routine clinical workflows.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.</p>
