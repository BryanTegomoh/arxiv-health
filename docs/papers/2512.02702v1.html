                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration method designed for UK Biobank data, augmenting intensity-based graph-cut registration with subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle masks. The proposed method significantly outperforms intensity-only registration and two established methods (uniGradICON, MIRTK) in terms of Dice scores and reduced label error frequency across 71 tissue masks. This advancement enables more robust body-wide spatial standardization and accurate voxel-wise correlation analyses between imaging biomarkers and non-imaging health data.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research improves a critical pre-processing step (image registration) for large-scale medical image analysis, particularly within the context of big data initiatives like the UK Biobank. Enhanced image registration provides more accurately aligned and standardized input data for subsequent AI and machine learning models.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.</p>
