                <p class="summary-text">This paper evaluates MedGemma, a new domain-specific language model, for structured medical order extraction from doctor-patient conversations, addressing clinical documentation burdens. It systematically compares one-shot, ReAct, and agentic prompting strategies, finding that the simpler one-shot method achieved the highest performance on the validation set, potentially due to complex reasoning introducing noise in manually annotated data.</p>

                    <p>The study involved evaluating MedGemma, a domain-specific open-source language model, for structured medical order extraction. It systematically compared the performance of three distinct prompting paradigms: a direct one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow, specifically using the official validation set of the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding was that the simpler one-shot prompting strategy, when applied with MedGemma, achieved superior performance in structured medical order extraction compared to more complex reasoning-focused (ReAct) and agentic workflow approaches on the official validation set. This suggests that complex reasoning can introduce noise or 'overthinking' when dealing with manually annotated, potentially cleaner, clinical transcripts.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers practical guidance for deploying large language models in clinical settings for automated order extraction. It suggests that for well-annotated clinical data, a direct, simpler prompting strategy might be more effective and efficient, potentially leading to faster implementation of systems that reduce documentation burden, minimize errors, and improve patient safety in healthcare workflows.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implicitly suggests a limitation regarding the applicability of complex prompting strategies, positing that their tendency for 'overthinking' and noise generation is particularly relevant to *manually annotated transcripts*. This implies that the findings might not directly translate to noisier, less curated, or real-world conversational data without further investigation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.</p>
