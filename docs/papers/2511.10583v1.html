                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper evaluates the performance of MedGemma, a domain-specific large language model, for the critical task of medical order extraction from doctor-patient conversations. The study systematically compares three prompting strategies—one-Shot, ReAct, and a multi-step agentic workflow—and surprisingly finds that the simpler one-Shot method achieved the highest performance on manually annotated transcripts, suggesting complex reasoning can introduce noise in certain data contexts.</p>

                    <p>The study evaluated MedGemma by comparing three prompting strategies: a one-Shot approach, a ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Performance was assessed on the official validation set of the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task, which involves extracting structured medical orders from manually annotated doctor-patient conversation transcripts.</p>

Contrary to intuition, more complex reasoning-focused frameworks like ReAct and multi-step agentic flows exhibited lower performance, with the authors positing that complex reasoning chains might lead to 'overthinking' and noise when applied to manually annotated transcripts.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research can significantly impact clinical practice by optimizing the implementation of LLMs for automated medical order extraction, potentially reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals and minimizing transcription errors, thereby enhancing patient safety and the efficiency of care delivery. It guides the selection of more effective and robust prompting strategies for real-world clinical NLP applications.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implies a limitation regarding complex prompting strategies: they may introduce 'overthinking' and noise, particularly when applied to manually annotated transcripts, suggesting their efficacy might be context-dependent (e.g., specific data types or annotation quality). The performance comparison is specifically on an official validation set, which might not fully represent the variability of real-world clinical conversations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.</p>
