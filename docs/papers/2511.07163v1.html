                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces LRTrend, an interpretable machine learning framework designed for real-time detection of disease outbreaks. It achieves this by aggregating diverse health and behavioral digital data streams within regions and learning disease-specific epidemic networks to synthesize information across regions. The framework successfully detected COVID-19 Delta and Omicron waves early, revealing novel epidemic connections across the United States that are distinct from standard human mobility patterns.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>LRTrend is an interpretable machine learning framework. It operates in two main stages: first, it aggregates diverse health and behavioral digital data streams (e.g., from various sensors, public data sources) within individual geographic regions. Second, it learns and leverages disease-specific epidemic networks to integrate and interpret information across these different regions, rather than relying solely on static or predefined human mobility networks.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study revealed previously unrecognized, diverse epidemic clusters and connections across the United States that are not adequately explained by standard human mobility networks. Furthermore, when applied to two years of COVID-19 data, LRTrend successfully detected regional Delta and Omicron waves within a two-week window from the outbreak's initiation, at a point when reported case counts represented only a small fraction of the eventual wave's peak.</p>

                <p>This system could significantly enhance the capacity of public health agencies and clinicians to monitor and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. By providing early and accurate alerts, it would allow for more timely implementation of control measures, targeted resource allocation, and informed public health communications, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and reduced community transmission.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Responding to disease outbreaks requires close surveillance of their
trajectories, but outbreak detection is hindered by the high noise in epidemic
time series. Aggregating information across data sources has shown great
denoising ability in other fields, but remains underexplored in epidemiology.
Here, we present LRTrend, an interpretable machine learning framework to
identify outbreaks in real time. LRTrend effectively aggregates diverse health
and behavioral data streams within one region and learns disease-specific
epidemic networks to aggregate information across regions. We reveal diverse
epidemic clusters and connections across the United States that are not well
explained by commonly used human mobility networks and may be informative for
future public health coordination. We apply LRTrend to 2 years of COVID-19 data
in 305 hospital referral regions and frequently detect regional Delta and
Omicron waves within 2 weeks of the outbreak's start, when case counts are a
small fraction of the wave's resulting peak.</p>
