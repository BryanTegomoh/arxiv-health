                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel 3D image reconstruction framework for multi-angle Field-Free Line (FFL) Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) that significantly enhances spatial resolution, quantitative accuracy, and high dynamic range imaging. By combining a physics-based FFL signal model with tomographic projection operators and harmonic-domain compression, the framework enables efficient, joint volumetric reconstructions on standard GPUs in minutes. It demonstrates substantially reduced background haze and an ~11x improvement in iron detection sensitivity in phantom and in vivo studies, boosting MPI image quality and reliability.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involves constructing an efficient 3D forward operator by integrating a physics-based FFL signal model with tomographic projection operators. This setup allows for joint volumetric reconstruction of the entire dataset rather than processing independent 2D projections.

This computational efficiency facilitates volumetric reconstructions on standard desktop GPU hardware within minutes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based imaging modality that
detects superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in vivo, with applications
in cancer cell tracking, lymph node mapping, and cell therapy monitoring. We
introduce a new 3D image reconstruction framework for MPI data acquired using
multi-angle field-free line (FFL) scans, demonstrating improvements in spatial
resolution, quantitative accuracy, and high dynamic range performance over
conventional sequential reconstruction pipelines. The framework is built by
combining a physics-based FFL signal model with tomographic projection
operators to form an efficient 3D forward operator, enabling the full dataset
to be reconstructed jointly rather than as a series of independent 2D
projections. A harmonic-domain compression step is incorporated naturally
within this operator formulation, reducing memory overhead by over two orders
of magnitude while preserving the structure and fidelity of the model, enabling
volumetric reconstructions on standard desktop GPU hardware in only minutes.
Phantom and in vivo results demonstrate substantially reduced background haze
and improved visualization of low-intensity regions adjacent to bright
structures, with an estimated $\sim$11$\times$ improvement in iron detection
sensitivity relative to the conventional X-space CT approach. These advances
enhance MPI image quality and quantitative reliability, supporting broader use
of MPI in preclinical and future clinical imaging.</p>
