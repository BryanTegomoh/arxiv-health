                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a hybrid semi-supervised multi-task learning approach to enhance retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) by providing interpretable feedback on specific acquisition defects without extensive manual labeling. The method combines manual overall quality labels with pseudo-labels for detailed quality attributes, generated by a Teacher model, to improve overall quality assessment and offer actionable insights into issues like illumination, clarity, and contrast. This approach aims to make RIQA models more useful in clinical settings by guiding image recapture processes.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Problem Addressed:** Existing RIQA tools typically classify only overall image quality, lacking specific defect indications (e.g., illumination, clarity, contrast) necessary to guide image recapture, primarily due to the high cost of detailed manual annotations.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Proposed Solution:** A hybrid semi-supervised multi-task learning framework is introduced, combining manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels for detailed quality attributes (like illumination, clarity, contrast).</li>
                    
                    <li>**Methodology:** Pseudo-labels for detailed quality defects are generated by a 'Teacher model' trained on a small, limited dataset. These pseudo-labels, alongside manual overall quality labels, are then used to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-18 backbone model within a multi-task learning setting.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Improved Performance:** The semi-supervised multi-task model significantly improved overall quality assessment, achieving F1 scores of 0.875 on EyeQ and 0.778 on DeepDRiD datasets, outperforming single-task baselines and matching or surpassing existing methods.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Enhanced Interpretability:** The multi-task model delivered performance for specific detail prediction tasks (e.g., illumination, clarity, contrast) statistically comparable to the Teacher model, providing crucial interpretable feedback.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Expert Alignment:** On a newly annotated EyeQ subset, the model's performance was similar to human experts, suggesting that the inherent noise in pseudo-labels aligns with typical expert variability.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Clinical Actionability:** The model provides clinically actionable outputs, offering specific, interpretable feedback on capture conditions to guide image recapture, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of diagnostic imaging workflows.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed a hybrid semi-supervised multi-task learning framework. This involves training a 'Teacher model' on a small, manually annotated dataset to generate pseudo-labels for specific image quality defects (e.g., illumination, clarity, contrast). These pseudo-labels are then used in conjunction with a small set of manual labels for overall image quality to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-18 backbone model. This multi-task setup simultaneously trains the model to assess overall quality and predict specific defect categories, leveraging the weakly supervised pseudo-labels for interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers a significant clinical impact by transforming RIQA from a simple pass/fail system into a diagnostic support tool that provides actionable guidance. Clinicians and technicians can receive specific feedback on why an image is poor (e.g., 'too dark', 'blurry'), enabling immediate corrective action during image acquisition. This leads to higher quality images for diagnosis, reduces the need for costly repeat visits, optimizes screening programs, and ultimately facilitates more accurate and efficient computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) supports computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases. However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture.</p>
