                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer control-theoretic architectural framework designed to embed societal values and ethical principles into AI systems. SRS models AI governance as a closed-loop supervisory control problem, enabling continuous monitoring and enforcement of aspects like fairness, autonomy, and safety throughout the AI lifecycle. It provides actionable engineering mechanisms to translate normative objectives into practical, auditable controls for socio-technical AI systems.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is highly relevant for medicine and health by providing a structured, enforceable approach to ensure AI systems in healthcare operate ethically, safely, and accountably.

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) framework provides a control-theoretic architecture to embed societal values (e.g., fairness, autonomy, explanation quality, cognitive burden) into AI systems. Its application to 'clinical decision support' systems aims to make these medical AI tools more accountable, adaptive, and auditable, ensuring responsible deployment and operation within healthcare settings. This directly addresses the governance and ethical challenges of AI used to assist medical professionals in making decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper proposes a novel architectural framework, the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), grounded in control-theoretic principles. It develops a unified constraint-based formulation and applies closed-loop supervisory control, safety-envelope concepts, and feedback mechanisms to model and enforce AI responsibility. The methodology is primarily theoretical and architectural, illustrated through conceptual case studies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the conceptualization and architectural design of the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), demonstrating how ethical principles can be integrated into AI as explicit, continuously enforceable engineering constraints. The paper shows that AI responsibility can be effectively managed as a closed-loop supervisory control problem, enabling continuous monitoring and enforcement of fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality, as validated by illustrative case studies in critical domains like clinical decision support.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The SRS framework offers several potential clinical impacts: **Enhanced Patient Safety** by embedding explicit safety constraints and continuous monitoring to prevent adverse events. **Improved Trust and Adoption** among clinicians and patients due to AI systems that are demonstrably fair, transparent, and respectful of autonomy. **Reduced Bias** in diagnostic and treatment recommendations through continuous fairness monitoring, promoting equitable healthcare. **Support for Ethical Practice** by providing explainable AI outputs and reducing cognitive burden on clinicians, facilitating informed decision-making. **Increased Accountability** for AI behavior in medical contexts due to the auditable nature of the framework.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations or caveats of the proposed framework. Potential inherent challenges for such architectural proposals often include the complexity of formalizing all 'societal values' into machine-executable constraints, the computational overhead of continuous runtime monitoring, and the practical challenges of implementation and adaptation in rapidly evolving real-world healthcare environments.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly detail future research directions beyond stating the framework provides a 'practical foundation'. However, implied future work could include empirical validation of SRS in diverse clinical settings, development of standardized tools or libraries for SRS implementation, and research into dynamic adaptation of value constraints and safety envelopes to evolving societal norms and clinical best practices.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.</p>
