                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a framework for governing socio-technical AI. In a health context, this framework would be applied to AI systems like clinical decision support tools. It aims to embed societal values, fairness, autonomy, and transparency directly into the design and operation of these medical AI systems. This would enable continuous monitoring and enforcement of ethical guidelines, reduce cognitive burden on clinicians, ensure explainable AI decisions, and provide safeguards against biased or harmful outcomes, thereby improving the safety and trustworthiness of AI applications in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.</p>
