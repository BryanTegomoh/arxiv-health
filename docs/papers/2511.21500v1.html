By integrating a transformation network with a time-shift correction network that utilizes Fourier phase shifts, ShiftSyncNet automatically aligns supervision signals, significantly improving accuracy in translating non-invasive signals like PPG/BCG into clinical measurements such as ABP. It offers a robust solution for enhancing continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed ShiftSyncNet framework employs a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization strategy. It features a Transformation Network (TransNet) responsible for converting non-invasive input signals (e.g., PPG, BCG) into target clinical signals (e.g., ABP). Complementing this is a Time-Shift Correction Network (SyncNet), which acts as a meta-learner. SyncNet is trained to learn the optimal time offsets between input signals and their corresponding misaligned supervision labels. It then applies Fourier phase shifts to precisely align these supervision signals, effectively correcting temporal misalignments before they are fed to TransNet for training. This iterative bi-level optimization allows SyncNet to dynamically improve label quality, thereby enhancing TransNet's performance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.</p>
