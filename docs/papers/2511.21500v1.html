                    <p>ShiftSyncNet utilizes a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework. It integrates a Transformation Network (TransNet) for the primary signal conversion and a Time-Shift Correction Network (SyncNet). SyncNet is trained to learn and predict precise time offsets between misaligned input and supervision signal pairs. These learned offsets are then used to apply Fourier phase shifts to the supervision signals, effectively realigning them to the input before being used for TransNet training, thereby correcting temporal discrepancies without manual intervention.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.</p>
