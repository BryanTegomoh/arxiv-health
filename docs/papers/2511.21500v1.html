                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ShiftSyncNet, a novel meta-learning framework that addresses the critical problem of temporal misalignment in multimodal physiological signal transformation (e.g., PPG to ABP). By employing a bi-level optimization approach with a transformation network and a time-shift correction network, ShiftSyncNet automatically learns and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals, significantly improving the accuracy of deriving clinically meaningful information from non-invasive data. Experiments show it outperforms strong baselines by substantial margins across various datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed ShiftSyncNet is a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework. It integrates a Transformation Network (TransNet) responsible for the primary signal conversion (e.g., PPG to ABP), and a Time-Shift Correction Network (SyncNet).

It then applies these learned offsets via Fourier phase shifts to align the supervision signals, effectively correcting temporal misalignment within the training data. This process is optimized using a meta-learning approach, allowing the framework to automatically adapt and improve alignment without manual tuning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.</p>
