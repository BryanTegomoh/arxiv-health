                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">ShiftSyncNet is a novel meta-learning framework designed to overcome temporal misalignment in transforming non-invasive physiological signals like PPG and BCG into clinically meaningful signals such as arterial blood pressure (ABP). This framework automatically learns and corrects time shifts using a bi-level optimization approach with Fourier phase shifts, significantly improving transformation accuracy and label quality compared to existing methods. Its effectiveness was demonstrated with substantial performance gains across multiple datasets.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Problem Addressed:** The core challenge is temporal misalignment between multimodal physiological signals (e.g., non-invasive inputs like PPG/BCG and target clinical signals like ABP), which severely degrades transformation accuracy, particularly for critical features like ABP peaks.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Proposed Solution:** ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework, is introduced to automatically mitigate performance degradation caused by time misalignment.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Framework Architecture:** ShiftSyncNet comprises two main networks: a Transformation Network (TransNet) responsible for the actual signal conversion, and a Time-Shift Correction Network (SyncNet) dedicated to identifying and correcting temporal offsets.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Correction Mechanism:** SyncNet learns precise time offsets between training input-label pairs and applies these corrections as Fourier phase shifts directly to the supervision signals (labels) to achieve accurate temporal alignment.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Performance Improvement:** Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets showed ShiftSyncNet outperforming strong baselines by significant margins: 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8% respectively.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Key Benefits:** The framework effectively corrects time shifts, enhances the quality of noisy labels (time-shifted supervision), and improves overall transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Future Direction:** The approach offers a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies, suggesting broader applicability in multimodal physiological signal transformation.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The ShiftSyncNet framework utilizes a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization approach. It consists of a TransNet that performs the primary signal transformation and a SyncNet. SyncNet is designed to learn the optimal time offsets between misaligned physiological input signals and their corresponding clinical supervision signals (labels). It then applies these learned offsets as Fourier phase shifts to the supervision signals, effectively correcting the temporal misalignment and improving the quality of the training labels used by TransNet.</p>

                <p>This technology has the potential to significantly enhance the reliability and accuracy of continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, even in challenging real-world conditions where signal synchronization issues are common. This can lead to more precise real-time patient monitoring in hospitals and homes, facilitate earlier detection of cardiovascular diseases, and broaden the accessibility of low-cost, continuous physiological measurements, ultimately improving patient outcomes and potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with invasive monitoring.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.</p>
