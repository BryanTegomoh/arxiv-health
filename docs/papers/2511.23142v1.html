                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper demonstrates that pretrained neural audio codecs, specifically the state-of-the-art DAC, can be effectively adapted for EEG compression despite inherent modality differences. By preprocessing raw EEG data to match the codec's input constraints and fine-tuning on EEG, stable and high-fidelity reconstructions are achieved. The approach, including a multi-channel extension (DAC-MC), is shown to preserve clinically relevant information on medical EEG datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves adapting a state-of-the-art neural audio codec (DAC) by preprocessing raw EEG signals to conform to its stride-based framing input. The audio-pretrained encoder-decoder components of DAC are directly reused and then fine-tuned on EEG specific data. Compression-quality trade-offs are investigated by adjusting parameters such as residual codebook depth, codebook size, and input sampling rate. For multi-channel EEG, a novel extension named DAC-MC is introduced, which incorporates attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding while maintaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluation is performed on clinically relevant datasets, TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy, using spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy as key metrics.</p>

                <p>This work has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of EEG data management in clinical settings.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">EEG and audio are inherently distinct modalities, differing in sampling rate, channel structure, and scale. Yet, we show that pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression, provided that the data are preprocessed to be suitable to the codec's input constraints. Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.</p>
