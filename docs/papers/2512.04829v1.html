                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel, sample-efficient, model-based AI framework to tackle the challenging mathematical problem of sphere packing, which has implications for fields like medical imaging. By formulating Semidefinite Program (SDP) construction as a sequential decision process, the AI achieved new state-of-the-art upper bounds for sphere packing in dimensions 4-16. This demonstrates that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems where traditional AI methods are infeasible due to high evaluation costs.</p>

                <p>Sphere packing is explicitly relevant to medical imaging by informing optimal arrangements and efficiencies, such as in designing sensor arrays, optimizing data acquisition strategies (e.g., k-space sampling in MRI), or modeling the structural organization of biological tissues and cells, potentially leading to improved diagnostic tools and image quality.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI is applied to 'math discovery' in sphere packing. Since sphere packing is relevant to medical imaging, this AI's capability to find 'state-of-the-art upper bounds' for sphere packing problems could, for example, lead to more efficient algorithms for image reconstruction, modeling of biological structures (like cells or tissues represented as packed spheres), or optimization in medical devices that rely on dense packing principles. The AI's contribution is foundational improvement in a mathematical problem with stated medical relevance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.</p>
