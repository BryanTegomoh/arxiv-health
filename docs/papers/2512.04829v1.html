                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a sample-efficient, model-based AI framework to address the computationally intensive problem of sphere packing, specifically focusing on deriving upper bounds. By reformulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the 'SDP game', and combining Bayesian optimization with Monte Carlo Tree Search, the authors achieve new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions 4-16, demonstrating a novel approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery in complex, evaluation-limited problems.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Sphere packing is explicitly noted as relevant to medical imaging. Understanding optimal packing arrangements can have implications for optimizing data acquisition in imaging, enhancing image reconstruction algorithms, or modeling the arrangement of biological structures (e.g., cells, proteins, nanoparticles) within a given space.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI methodology developed, a sample-efficient model-based framework combining Bayesian optimization with Monte Carlo Tree Search, is applied to advance understanding in sphere packing. Improved understanding or solutions in sphere packing can directly benefit 'medical imaging' applications that utilize these principles (e.g., modeling tissue structures, signal processing, or data compression in imaging). Beyond direct applications to medical imaging, the AI-assisted discovery approach itself, designed for problems with costly evaluations and limited data, could serve as a model for tackling other computationally intensive discovery problems in health and medicine, such as drug discovery, materials science for prosthetics, or optimizing treatment protocols where experimental evaluation is expensive.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>While this is a foundational mathematical and AI research paper, its indirect clinical impact stems from its relevance to medical imaging. Improved theoretical understanding and computational tools for sphere packing could inform the design of more efficient data acquisition protocols (e.g., optimizing sensor placement or sampling patterns) and sophisticated image reconstruction algorithms in modalities like MRI or CT. This could lead to faster scans, higher image quality, reduced radiation dose, or better characterization of complex biological microstructures at a fundamental level, ultimately benefiting diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>

In a medical context, this suggests applying similar AI paradigms to other computationally intensive, high-stakes problems in drug discovery, materials science for implants, or complex biological system modeling where physical experiments or simulations are prohibitively expensive.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.</p>
