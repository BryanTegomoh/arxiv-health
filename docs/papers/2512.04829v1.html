                <p>While not directly clinical, the advancements in sphere packing algorithms could indirectly impact medical imaging by providing theoretical foundations for more efficient image compression, faster reconstruction algorithms from raw data, or optimized sensor array designs. This could lead to reduced scan times, lower radiation doses (e.g., in CT), improved image resolution, or more compact and powerful medical devices. The general AI framework could also be adapted to other complex optimization problems in medical research, such as drug discovery or treatment planning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.</p>
