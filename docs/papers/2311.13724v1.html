                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical need to enhance infectious disease surveillance and forecasting systems in the United States, drawing lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. It defines the requirements for an effective surveillance system to support evidence-based decision-making during pandemics, detailing necessary data elements, informing transmission-dynamic models, and considering health equity.</p>

                    <p>The paper employs a conceptual and analytical approach, synthesizing lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic experience in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. It involves defining system requirements by identifying decision needs, requisite data elements, and outlining actions for system improvement, including health equity considerations.</p>

                    <p>The abstract outlines that the paper's main 'findings' are the comprehensive set of requirements for an effective surveillance system, including a detailed delineation of: the decisions surveillance data must inform; the specific data elements needed for both decision-making and model calibration; the tailored data needs of various jurisdictional health authorities; and the necessary actions to ensure data availability and enhance health equity.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Implementing the proposed surveillance upgrades would equip clinicians, hospital systems, and public health officials with more accurate, timely, and granular data. This would directly improve clinical decision-making, optimize resource allocation (e.g., staffing, bed capacity, therapeutics), guide infection control practices, and enable targeted, effective public health interventions to mitigate disease spread and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to upgrade systems for infectious disease surveillance and forecasting and modeling of the spread of infection, both of which inform evidence-based public health guidance and policies. Here, we discuss requirements for an effective surveillance system to support decision making during a pandemic, drawing on the lessons of COVID-19 in the U.S., while looking to jurisdictions in the U.S. and beyond to learn lessons about the value of specific data types. In this report, we define the range of decisions for which surveillance data are required, the data elements needed to inform these decisions and to calibrate inputs and outputs of transmission-dynamic models, and the types of data needed to inform decisions by state, territorial, local, and tribal health authorities. We define actions needed to ensure that such data will be available and consider the contribution of such efforts to improving health equity.</p>
