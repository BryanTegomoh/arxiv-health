                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper outlines the critical needs for upgrading infectious disease surveillance, forecasting, and modeling systems in the United States, leveraging lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It defines the necessary data elements and system requirements to support evidence-based public health decision-making across various levels of authority, while also addressing health equity.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This analysis is crucial for modernizing public health infrastructure, enabling more effective and equitable responses to future infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics, thereby directly impacting patient care coordination, resource allocation, and population health outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper highlights the need for 'forecasting and modeling of the spread of infection' and 'calibrating inputs and outputs of transmission-dynamic models.' These tasks are prime applications for AI and machine learning, which can be used to analyze surveillance data, predict disease outbreaks, optimize resource allocation, develop early warning systems, and inform public health interventions. While not explicitly stating 'AI,' the emphasis on data-driven modeling and decision support in infectious disease surveillance strongly implicates medical AI applications in epidemiology and public health.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The paper identifies that effective pandemic response necessitates significantly upgraded surveillance systems capable of informing diverse public health decisions. It concludes that specific data elements are crucial for both operational decision support and the calibration of transmission models, and that tailored data strategies are required for different levels of health authority. Furthermore, it highlights that proactive steps are needed to ensure data availability and improve health equity through these surveillance efforts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to upgrade systems for infectious disease surveillance and forecasting and modeling of the spread of infection, both of which inform evidence-based public health guidance and policies. Here, we discuss requirements for an effective surveillance system to support decision making during a pandemic, drawing on the lessons of COVID-19 in the U.S., while looking to jurisdictions in the U.S. and beyond to learn lessons about the value of specific data types. In this report, we define the range of decisions for which surveillance data are required, the data elements needed to inform these decisions and to calibrate inputs and outputs of transmission-dynamic models, and the types of data needed to inform decisions by state, territorial, local, and tribal health authorities. We define actions needed to ensure that such data will be available and consider the contribution of such efforts to improving health equity.</p>
