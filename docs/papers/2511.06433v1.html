                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">With the increasing demand for histopathological specimen examination and
diagnostic reporting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has received heightened
research focus as a viable solution for AI-centric diagnostic aid. Recently, to
improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL
approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed,
delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution
images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL,
previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking
research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for
trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused
Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists'
examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using
multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise
loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their
uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a
neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In
addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty
without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical
advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior
performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy
comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.</p>
