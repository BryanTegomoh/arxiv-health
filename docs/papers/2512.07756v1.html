                    <p>UltrasODM is a dual-stream deep learning framework. It leverages a contrastive ranking module to group ultrasound frames based on motion similarity. An optical-flow stream, enhanced with Dual-Mamba temporal modules, is employed for robust 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) pose estimation of the ultrasound probe. A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer integrates Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps to identify and highlight low-confidence regions, subsequently issuing unobtrusive alerts with suggested corrective actions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical ultrasound acquisition is highly operator-dependent, where rapid probe motion and brightness fluctuations often lead to reconstruction errors that reduce trust and clinical utility. We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs. By emphasizing transparency and clinician feedback, UltrasODM improves reconstruction reliability and supports safer, more trustworthy clinical workflows.
