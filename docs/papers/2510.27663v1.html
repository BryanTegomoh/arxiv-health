                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification testing in Bayesian imaging inverse problems, particularly when ground truth data is unavailable. By combining Bayesian cross-validation with a randomized measurement splitting technique called data fission, the approach effectively evaluates imaging models, including those with modern machine learning-defined priors. The methodology demonstrates excellent selection and detection accuracy with low computational cost, making it highly suitable for complex computational imaging tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to
address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper
addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground
truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification
diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable
for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and
incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine
learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model
selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on
a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized
measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian
imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate
the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types
of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection
accuracy with a low computational cost.</p>
