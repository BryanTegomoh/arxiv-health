                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Disentangled360 is an innovative 3D-aware technology that generates physically aware 360-degree views from a single image by disentangling isotropic and anisotropic light contributions within a Gaussian Splatting framework. It employs a dual-branch conditioning system for both CT intensity-driven volumetric data and real-world RGB scenes, addressing scale ambiguity and structural realism with a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method. The framework demonstrates superior image quality (SSIM, LPIPS) and interactive runtime on medical and natural scene datasets, enabling rapid, photorealistic view synthesis for applications like mixed-reality medical supervision.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.</p>
