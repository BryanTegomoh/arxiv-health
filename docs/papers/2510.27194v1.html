                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the growing complexity in product development, where isolated products are now interconnected nodes in networked Systems of Systems (SoS), rendering traditional linear lifecycle models inadequate. It proposes a practical framework for SoS lifecycle management, integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for semantics, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) for governance, and digital thread/twin for continuous feedback, underpinned by four key principles and a three-step roadmap for network-centric development. The ultimate goal is to enhance change robustness, reduce throughput times, and improve sustainability in complex system design.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Healthcare is explicitly cited as an industry where this framework is relevant. Modern medical ecosystems, encompassing integrated patient care platforms, networked medical devices, and digital health solutions, are inherently complex Systems of Systems. This paper's approach provides a structured methodology to manage their entire lifecycle, ensuring interoperability, robust configuration, and clear governance across diverse medical technologies and organizational boundaries, which is crucial for patient safety and clinical efficacy.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While not describing a specific AI application for health, the paper provides a foundational framework for managing the lifecycle of complex systems, which directly applies to the development, integration, governance, and sustained operation of AI-driven medical devices, diagnostic systems, integrated digital health platforms, and other AI applications within healthcare. Methodologies like Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), digital thread, and digital twin are crucial for ensuring the robustness, traceability, and compliance of AI systems in a safety-critical domain like medicine.</p>

                <p>Implementing this SoS lifecycle management framework in healthcare could lead to more resilient and adaptable integrated care systems, faster and safer integration of new medical devices and digital health solutions, and improved traceability of complex medical system configurations. This translates directly to enhanced patient safety, reduced medical errors stemming from system incompatibilities or poor governance, and more efficient, sustainable healthcare delivery.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.</p>
