                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the growing challenges of managing modern networked systems (System of Systems, SoS) where traditional linear lifecycle models prove inadequate, especially concerning interoperability, configuration, and governance across organizational boundaries. It proposes a practical framework for SoS lifecycle management, integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) as a semantic backbone, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) for governance, CAD-CAE for model-derived domains, and digital thread/twin for continuous feedback. The paper also identifies four guiding principles and a three-step roadmap for transitioning to network-centric development, aiming to enhance robustness, shorten throughput times, and improve reuse and sustainability.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Healthcare systems are increasingly complex System of Systems, integrating diverse medical devices, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms, and AI diagnostics. This framework offers a robust approach to manage their interoperability, configuration, and lifecycle, ensuring robustness, traceability, and efficient evolution of critical digital health infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the abstract does not detail specific AI algorithms or clinical applications, the paper is categorized under cs.AI and discusses methodologies like Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Digital Twin. When applied to the explicitly mentioned healthcare sector, this implies the use of AI-driven frameworks for designing, optimizing, and governing complex networked healthcare products and systems. This could involve AI for predictive analytics in digital twins of hospital systems or medical devices, AI-assisted configuration management for healthcare IT, or AI-enhanced interoperability solutions for integrated care networks, all contributing to increased robustness, shorter throughput times, and improved decision-making in health systems.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Implementing this framework in healthcare can significantly improve the design, development, and operation of complex clinical systems. It can lead to enhanced interoperability between medical devices and EHRs, more robust and adaptable telemedicine platforms, and better traceability for patient care pathways involving multiple integrated technologies. This can result in increased patient safety, faster adoption of new health technologies, reduced operational costs through improved reuse, and more informed decision-making regarding the long-term sustainability of healthcare solutions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.</p>
