                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present ROBOTO2, an open-source, web-based platform for large language
model (LLM)-assisted risk of bias (ROB) assessment of clinical trials. ROBOTO2
streamlines the traditionally labor-intensive ROB v2 (ROB2) annotation process
via an interactive interface that combines PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM
prompting, and human-in-the-loop review. Users can upload clinical trial
reports, receive preliminary answers and supporting evidence for ROB2 signaling
questions, and provide real-time feedback or corrections to system suggestions.
ROBOTO2 is publicly available at https://roboto2.vercel.app/, with code and
data released to foster reproducibility and adoption. We construct and release
a dataset of 521 pediatric clinical trial reports (8954 signaling questions
with 1202 evidence passages), annotated using both manually and LLM-assisted
methods, serving as a benchmark and enabling future research. Using this
dataset, we benchmark ROB2 performance for 4 LLMs and provide an analysis into
current model capabilities and ongoing challenges in automating this critical
aspect of systematic review.</p>
