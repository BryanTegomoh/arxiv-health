                    <p>A comprehensive framework for artifact-free Zero Echo Time (ZTE) imaging at low magnetic fields was developed. This included: (i) meticulous calibration of RF pulse pre/counteremphasis to mitigate ring-down and electronics switching artifacts; (ii) an extended Single-Point Double-Shot (SPDS) protocol for simultaneous and accurate B0 and B1 field mapping; and (iii) a model-based image reconstruction method that incorporates these measured field maps directly into the encoding matrix. ZTE imaging, utilizing an optimized PETRA sequence, and Variable Flip Angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles, with results benchmarked against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by enabling high-quality and quantitative musculoskeletal MRI scans with affordable, portable systems. This could facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis of orthopedic injuries, degenerative joint diseases, and other conditions in a wider range of clinical settings, including remote areas, underserved communities, or at the point of care. The ability to image hard tissues and provide quantitative T1 maps could lead to improved patient management, personalized treatment strategies, and reduced healthcare costs by making advanced imaging more accessible.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, by establishing "methodological foundations," it implies that further validation or broader clinical application may be necessary. The focus on musculoskeletal tissues suggests that applications to other body regions might present different technical challenges. While a significant advance for low-field systems, intrinsic differences in image resolution or signal-to-noise ratio compared to high-field MRI systems for certain diagnostic tasks may exist.</p>

                <p>The proposed framework broadens the range of feasible pulse sequences for portable low-field MRI, suggesting future work could involve adapting other advanced MRI sequences for these systems. Further research may focus on expanding the application to a wider range of anatomical regions and pathologies, optimizing image acquisition speed and resolution, and conducting larger-scale clinical trials to establish definitive diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. Exploration of integration into routine clinical workflows and cost-effectiveness analyses are also implied next steps.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of performing in vivo imaging and quantitative relaxation mapping of soft and hard tissues using a low-cost, portable MRI scanner, and to establish the methodological foundations for zero echo time (ZTE) imaging in systems affected by strong field inhomogeneities. Methods: A complete framework for artifact-free ZTE imaging at low field was developed, including: (i) RF pulse pre/counteremphasis calibration to minimize ring-down and electronics switching time; (ii) an extension of a recent single-point double-shot (SPDS) protocol for simultaneous B0 and B1 mapping; and (iii) a model-based reconstruction incorporating these field maps into the encoding matrix. ZTE imaging and variable flip angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles, and benchmarked against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions. Results: The optimized PETRA sequence produced 3D images of knees and ankles within clinically compatible times (< 15 min), revealing hard tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone that are invisible in spin-echo sequences. The extended SPDS method enabled accurate field mapping, while the VFA approach provided the first in vivo T1 measurements of hard tissues at B0 < 0.1 T. Conclusions: The proposed framework broadens the range of pulse sequences feasible in portable low-field MRI and demonstrates the potential of ZTE for quantitative and structural imaging of musculoskeletal tissues in affordable Halbach-based systems.</p>
