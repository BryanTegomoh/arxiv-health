                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed a comprehensive framework for artifact-free Zero Echo Time (ZTE) imaging at low magnetic fields. This involved: (i) optimizing RF pulse characteristics (pre/counteremphasis calibration) to mitigate ring-down and electronics switching artifacts; (ii) extending a single-point double-shot (SPDS) protocol to simultaneously map B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities; and (iii) implementing a model-based reconstruction that incorporates these acquired field maps into the image encoding matrix. ZTE imaging (using an optimized PETRA sequence) and Variable Flip Angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and subsequently applied in vivo to human knees and ankles. The results were benchmarked against conventional RARE and STIR sequences.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The optimized PETRA sequence successfully generated 3D images of human knees and ankles within clinically acceptable acquisition times (< 15 min), clearly visualizing hard tissues like ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone, which are typically unobservable with conventional spin-echo sequences. The newly extended SPDS method proved effective in achieving accurate B0 and B1 field mapping. Furthermore, the VFA approach enabled the first ever in vivo T1 measurements of hard tissues at very low magnetic fields (B0 < 0.1 T).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has the potential to significantly expand access to advanced MRI diagnostics for musculoskeletal disorders. By providing high-quality structural and quantitative imaging of hard and soft tissues on portable, affordable Halbach MRI systems, it could facilitate point-of-care diagnostics in remote areas, smaller clinics, athletic facilities, or even for intraoperative guidance, where traditional high-field MRI is impractical or unavailable, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved patient management.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of performing in vivo imaging and quantitative relaxation mapping of soft and hard tissues using a low-cost, portable MRI scanner, and to establish the methodological foundations for zero echo time (ZTE) imaging in systems affected by strong field inhomogeneities. Methods: A complete framework for artifact-free ZTE imaging at low field was developed, including: (i) RF pulse pre/counteremphasis calibration to minimize ring-down and electronics switching time; (ii) an extension of a recent single-point double-shot (SPDS) protocol for simultaneous B0 and B1 mapping; and (iii) a model-based reconstruction incorporating these field maps into the encoding matrix. ZTE imaging and variable flip angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles, and benchmarked against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions. Results: The optimized PETRA sequence produced 3D images of knees and ankles within clinically compatible times (< 15 min), revealing hard tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone that are invisible in spin-echo sequences. The extended SPDS method enabled accurate field mapping, while the VFA approach provided the first in vivo T1 measurements of hard tissues at B0 < 0.1 T. Conclusions: The proposed framework broadens the range of pulse sequences feasible in portable low-field MRI and demonstrates the potential of ZTE for quantitative and structural imaging of musculoskeletal tissues in affordable Halbach-based systems.</p>
