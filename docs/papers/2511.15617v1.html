                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for artifact-free Zero Echo Time (ZTE) imaging on low-cost, portable Halbach MRI scanners, demonstrating its feasibility for in vivo structural and quantitative T1 mapping of soft and hard tissues. The developed methodology successfully visualizes hard tissues like ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone, which are typically invisible in conventional spin-echo sequences, and provides the first in vivo T1 measurements of these tissues at ultra-low field strengths (B0 < 0.1 T).</p>

                    <p>The study involved developing a complete framework for artifact-free ZTE imaging at low magnetic fields. This framework comprised: (i) RF pulse pre/counteremphasis calibration to minimize ring-down and electronics switching time; (ii) an extended single-point double-shot (SPDS) protocol for simultaneous B0 and B1 field mapping; and (iii) a model-based reconstruction method incorporating these field maps into the encoding matrix. ZTE imaging (using an optimized PETRA sequence) and variable flip angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles. The performance was benchmarked against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of performing in vivo imaging and quantitative relaxation mapping of soft and hard tissues using a low-cost, portable MRI scanner, and to establish the methodological foundations for zero echo time (ZTE) imaging in systems affected by strong field inhomogeneities. Methods: A complete framework for artifact-free ZTE imaging at low field was developed, including: (i) RF pulse pre/counteremphasis calibration to minimize ring-down and electronics switching time; (ii) an extension of a recent single-point double-shot (SPDS) protocol for simultaneous B0 and B1 mapping; and (iii) a model-based reconstruction incorporating these field maps into the encoding matrix. ZTE imaging and variable flip angle (VFA) T1 mapping were performed on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles, and benchmarked against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions. Results: The optimized PETRA sequence produced 3D images of knees and ankles within clinically compatible times (< 15 min), revealing hard tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone that are invisible in spin-echo sequences. The extended SPDS method enabled accurate field mapping, while the VFA approach provided the first in vivo T1 measurements of hard tissues at B0 < 0.1 T. Conclusions: The proposed framework broadens the range of pulse sequences feasible in portable low-field MRI and demonstrates the potential of ZTE for quantitative and structural imaging of musculoskeletal tissues in affordable Halbach-based systems.</p>
