                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), a novel unified network representation that integrates fine-scale gyral and sulcal folding patterns of the brain, addressing the limitations of traditional regional-level network studies. Evaluated across over 1,600 brains of diverse ages and health conditions, GS-Net effectively represents cortical folding from a network perspective and offers a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks in health and disease.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net) provides a novel, integrated network representation of brain folding patterns. This structured anatomical network data can serve as a robust feature set for machine learning and AI models.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The GS-Net has significant potential to enhance the clinical understanding, diagnosis, and monitoring of various brain disorders. By providing a detailed, quantifiable network representation of cortical folding, it could facilitate the identification of subtle anatomical abnormalities and their progression in conditions such as neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, schizophrenia), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), and epilepsy, potentially at earlier stages. This could lead to improved diagnostic accuracy, personalized prognostic indicators, and a deeper understanding of disease pathophysiology, ultimately informing more targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks. (The GS-Net toolbox will be released soon.)</p>
