                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized the HAA500 dataset to compare action recognition performance between conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) and human participants (N=28). Stimuli were presented in three formats: full scenes (body + background), body-removed (background only), and background-removed (body only). Subsequently, a novel brain-inspired DNN architecture, featuring distinct processing streams for body and background information, was developed and tested using the same stimulus variations to evaluate its performance and alignment with human accuracy patterns.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Conventional DNNs showed a strong reliance on background information, performing near chance-level on body-only stimuli while maintaining accuracy on background-only stimuli. Conversely, human participants demonstrated accurate action recognition across all three stimulus types, with significantly higher performance on body-only stimuli than on background-only stimuli. The novel brain-inspired architecture not only improved overall action recognition performance but also exhibited an accuracy pattern across different stimulus versions that closely mirrored that observed in human participants.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The development of DNNs that more robustly leverage distinct visual cues for action recognition has significant clinical impact. It enables the creation of more reliable AI systems for patient safety, such as accurate real-time fall detection systems in homes or hospitals, especially in cluttered or partially obscured environments. It also supports better automated assessment of patient movement and progress in physical therapy and rehabilitation, and can lead to more sophisticated and context-aware assistive robotics for elderly care or surgical support, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and reducing caregiver burden.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.</p>
