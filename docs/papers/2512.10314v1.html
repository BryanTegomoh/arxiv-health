                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DualProtoSeg, a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) framework designed for histopathology images, which tackles common issues like region shrinkage and feature heterogeneity. It achieves this by integrating a dual-modal prototype bank that combines text-guided and image-based prototypes with a multi-scale pyramid module for enhanced spatial precision. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark, showcasing the effectiveness of leveraging vision-language alignment for improved region discovery in digital pathology.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DualProtoSeg employs a prototype-driven framework that constructs a dual-modal prototype bank. This bank combines text-based prototypes, generated through CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning (leveraging vision-language models like CLIP), with learnable image prototypes. To counter oversmoothing in Vision Transformer (ViT) representations and improve spatial precision, a multi-scale pyramid module is integrated into the architecture. The model learns from image-level labels to perform pixel-level semantic segmentation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.</p>
