                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method for constructing prediction intervals for Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) that vary over time and across multiple decision points. Utilizing conformal inference techniques, the proposed approach offers guaranteed lower bound coverage, notably with weaker assumptions compared to existing literature. The methodology is primarily supported by simulations mimicking micro-randomized trials (MRTs) in mobile health (mHealth) and demonstrated on the real-world Intern Health Study (IHS) MRT.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the development of a novel method that constructs prediction intervals for time-varying ITEs with a guaranteed lower bound for coverage, a significant improvement in robustness over prior methods. This coverage guarantee is explicitly stated as being dependent on the degree of non-exchangeability in the data. The method's effectiveness and theoretical underpinnings are validated through simulations focused on MRTs and demonstrated in a real-world medical study (Intern Health Study).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This method can significantly enhance the reliability of personalized healthcare decisions by providing more accurate and robust uncertainty estimates for individual treatment effects. It is particularly impactful for mHealth studies and adaptive interventions, allowing for more precise tailoring of interventions to patients in real-time. Clinicians could use these prediction intervals to better understand the potential range of outcomes for an individual patient under different treatment strategies, improving shared decision-making and optimizing intervention delivery.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract indicates that the guaranteed coverage is a 'lower bound' and its effectiveness is 'dependent on the degree of non-exchangeability in the data'. This suggests that while a minimum coverage is assured, the actual coverage might vary and could be less precise in highly non-exchangeable data settings, potentially requiring careful interpretation of the interval width.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated as 'future directions,' the abstract highlights the broad applicability of the method across various decision-making contexts (healthcare, finance, education, online marketplaces). This implies future work could involve extending its application to more diverse real-world datasets and contexts beyond mHealth, further exploring its performance under varying degrees of non-exchangeability, and potentially refining the bounds or developing methods to mitigate the impact of high non-exchangeability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurately quantifying uncertainty of individual treatment effects (ITEs) across multiple decision points is crucial for personalized decision-making in fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and online marketplaces. Previous work has focused on predicting non-causal longitudinal estimands or constructing prediction bands for ITEs using cross-sectional data based on exchangeability assumptions. We propose a novel method for constructing prediction intervals using conformal inference techniques for time-varying ITEs with weaker assumptions than prior literature. We guarantee a lower bound for coverage, which is dependent on the degree of non-exchangeability in the data. Although our method is broadly applicable across decision-making contexts, we support our theoretical claims with simulations emulating micro-randomized trials (MRTs) -- a sequential experimental design for mobile health (mHealth) studies. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by applying it to a real-world MRT - the Intern Health Study (IHS).</p>
