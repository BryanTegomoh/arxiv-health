                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper identifies a new class of LLM hallucinations driven by spurious correlations in training data, where superficial associations (e.g., surnames and nationality) lead to plausible but incorrect outputs. These hallucinations are confidently generated, resistant to model scaling and fine-tuning, and critically, evade existing detection methods like confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing. The research highlights an urgent need for novel detection approaches specifically designed for these robust, undetected biases.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Large Language Models are increasingly integrated into healthcare for tasks like clinical decision support, diagnostic assistance, and patient information. If these models confidently generate medically incorrect advice or information due to spurious correlations (e.g., falsely linking a demographic trait to a specific disease, or a common symptom to a rare condition), it could lead to severe patient harm, misdiagnosis, or inappropriate treatment.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The inability of current detection methods to identify these spurious-correlation-driven hallucinations means that LLMs deployed in clinical settings could confidently generate medically incorrect information that goes unnoticed. This poses a significant risk for misdiagnosis, suboptimal treatment plans, the dissemination of misinformation, and could severely erode trust in AI-driven healthcare solutions, potentially endangering patient safety. New, robust detection and mitigation mechanisms are critical before widespread clinical adoption of LLMs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to
exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this
paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of
hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically
prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g.,
nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious
correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to
model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal
fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and
empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs
(including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such
as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in
the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine
confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent
need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by
spurious correlations.</p>
