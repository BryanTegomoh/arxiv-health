                    <p>The THIR framework applies cubical persistence, a method within Topological Data Analysis (TDA), directly to RGB histopathological images. It extracts Betti numbers, which quantify topological features (e.g., connected components and loops) at varying scales, to generate compact, interpretable "topological fingerprints" as feature vectors. Image retrieval is subsequently achieved by computing the distances between these unsupervisedly derived topological descriptors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer claimed the lives of approximately 685,000 women in 2020. Early diagnosis and accurate clinical decision making are critical in reducing this global burden. In this study, we propose THIR, a novel Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) framework that leverages topological data analysis specifically, Betti numbers derived from persistent homology to characterize and retrieve histopathological images based on their intrinsic structural patterns. Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that rely on extensive training, annotated datasets, and powerful GPU resources, THIR operates entirely without supervision. It extracts topological fingerprints directly from RGB histopathological images using cubical persistence, encoding the evolution of loops as compact, interpretable feature vectors. The similarity retrieval is then performed by computing the distances between these topological descriptors, efficiently returning the top-K most relevant matches.
  Extensive experiments on the BreaKHis dataset demonstrate that THIR outperforms state of the art supervised and unsupervised methods. It processes the entire dataset in under 20 minutes on a standard CPU, offering a fast, scalable, and training free solution for clinical image retrieval.</p>
