                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>GRASP employs a multi-agent architecture built around typed biological knowledge graphs to represent QSP models. Its workflow includes an "Understanding" phase for reconstructing graphs from existing code and an "Action" phase for language-driven, constraint-checked model modification, orchestrated by a state machine with iterative validation. It utilizes breadth-first parameter-alignment (BFS alignment) to manage dependencies and parameter proposals, and automatically generates executable MATLAB/SimBiology code while ensuring physiological and mathematical constraints. Performance was assessed using an LLM-as-judge comparing GRASP against SME-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) baselines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling is essential for drug development but it requires significant time investment that limits the throughput of domain experts. We present \textbf{GRASP} -- a multi-agent, graph-reasoning framework with a human-in-the-loop conversational interface -- that encodes QSP models as typed biological knowledge graphs and compiles them to executable MATLAB/SimBiology code while preserving units, mass balance, and physiological constraints. A two-phase workflow -- \textsc{Understanding} (graph reconstruction of legacy code) and \textsc{Action} (constraint-checked, language-driven modification) -- is orchestrated by a state machine with iterative validation. GRASP performs breadth-first parameter-alignment around new entities to surface dependent quantities and propose biologically plausible defaults, and it runs automatic execution/diagnostics until convergence. In head-to-head evaluations using LLM-as-judge, GRASP outperforms SME-guided CoT and ToT baselines across biological plausibility, mathematical correctness, structural fidelity, and code quality (\(\approx\)9--10/10 vs.\ 5--7/10). BFS alignment achieves F1 = 0.95 for dependency discovery, units, and range. These results demonstrate that graph-structured, agentic workflows can make QSP model development both accessible and rigorous, enabling domain experts to specify mechanisms in natural language without sacrificing biomedical fidelity.</p>
