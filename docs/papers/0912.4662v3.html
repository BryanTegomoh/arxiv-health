                    <p>Age-specific vaccination scheduling is paramount for pandemic control, with the best identified strategy leading to attack rates up to 10% lower than other strategies. The timing of vaccine rollout is critical; a mere ten-day delay in campaign initiation can result in a 6% increase in attack rates. Furthermore, accurately accounting for the delay between vaccination and the development of protective immunity is a key factor for proper impact evaluation.</p>

                <p>The findings have direct implications for public health officials and policymakers, advocating for prompt, age-specific vaccination campaigns during influenza pandemics. This research supports prioritizing specific age groups and accelerating vaccine delivery to maximize population protection and reduce disease burden, while also highlighting the importance of considering biological delays in immune response for realistic planning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Finding optimal policies to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the ongoing pandemic is a top public health priority. Using a compartmental model with age structure and vaccination status, we examined the effect of age specific scheduling of vaccination during a pandemic influenza outbreak, when there is a race between the vaccination campaign and the dynamics of the pandemic. Our results agree with some recent studies on that age specificity is paramount to vaccination planning. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such control measures when they are applied during the outbreak. Comparing five possible strategies, we found that age specific scheduling can have a huge impact on the outcome of the epidemic. For the best scheme, the attack rates were up to 10% lower than for other strategies. We demonstrate the importance of early start of the vaccination campaign, since ten days delay may increase the attack rate by up to 6%. Taking into account the delay between developing immunity and vaccination is a key factor in evaluating the impact of vaccination campaigns. We provide a general framework which will be useful for the next pandemic waves as well.</p>
