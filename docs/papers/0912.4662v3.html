                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper utilizes an age-structured compartmental model to evaluate the impact of age-specific vaccination scheduling during an influenza pandemic outbreak, comparing five strategies. It finds that age-specific scheduling significantly reduces attack rates, with the best strategy achieving up to a 10% reduction compared to others, and critically emphasizes the importance of early vaccination campaign initiation. The study also highlights the necessity of considering immunity development delay for accurate impact assessment.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a mathematical compartmental model featuring age structure and vaccination status. This model simulated the progression of an influenza pandemic outbreak, allowing for the comparative analysis of five distinct age-specific vaccination scheduling strategies implemented during the epidemic.

                    <p>Age-specific vaccination scheduling profoundly impacts pandemic outcomes, confirming its paramount importance for effective control. The optimal age-specific strategy achieved up to a 10% reduction in attack rates compared to other evaluated approaches. Campaign timing is highly sensitive, with a ten-day delay in vaccination rollout potentially increasing the attack rate by up to 6%. Furthermore, accurately assessing campaign effectiveness necessitates explicit consideration of the delay in immunity development post-vaccination.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings directly inform the implementation of urgent public health interventions during pandemics by advocating for rapid, age-specific vaccine allocation. Prioritizing vaccine distribution to specific age groups can significantly reduce overall disease burden. It underscores the critical need for efficient logistics and prompt public health messaging, as even minor delays in vaccine deployment (e.g., 10 days) can have a quantifiable negative impact on population health. The developed framework offers a valuable tool for pandemic preparedness and real-time response decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential implicit limitations include reliance on a specific compartmental model and its inherent assumptions, which may not fully capture real-world complexities such as varying vaccine effectiveness across age groups, behavioral changes, or vaccine hesitancy. The study's focus on influenza means that specific quantitative results might not directly translate to pandemics caused by other pathogens with different biological characteristics or transmission dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Finding optimal policies to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the ongoing pandemic is a top public health priority. Using a compartmental model with age structure and vaccination status, we examined the effect of age specific scheduling of vaccination during a pandemic influenza outbreak, when there is a race between the vaccination campaign and the dynamics of the pandemic. Our results agree with some recent studies on that age specificity is paramount to vaccination planning. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such control measures when they are applied during the outbreak. Comparing five possible strategies, we found that age specific scheduling can have a huge impact on the outcome of the epidemic. For the best scheme, the attack rates were up to 10% lower than for other strategies. We demonstrate the importance of early start of the vaccination campaign, since ten days delay may increase the attack rate by up to 6%. Taking into account the delay between developing immunity and vaccination is a key factor in evaluating the impact of vaccination campaigns. We provide a general framework which will be useful for the next pandemic waves as well.</p>
