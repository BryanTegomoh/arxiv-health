                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have improved
diagnostic capabilities in healthcare, yet limited interpretability continues
to hinder clinical adoption. Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse
symptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools
that capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond
binary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages
articulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a
weighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract
coordination. Eigenspectra plots effectively distinguished complex from simpler
coordination patterns, and WSED scores reliably separated these groups, with
ambiguity confined to a narrow range near zero. Importantly, WSED scores
correlated not only with overall BPRS severity but also with the balance
between positive and negative symptoms, reflecting more complex coordination in
subjects with pronounced positive symptoms and the opposite trend for stronger
negative symptoms. This approach offers a transparent, severity-sensitive
biomarker for schizophrenia, advancing the potential for clinically
interpretable speech-based assessment tools.</p>
