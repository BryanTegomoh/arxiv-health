                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel 2-parameter generalized-growth model designed to accurately characterize the early ascending phase of infectious disease outbreaks, accommodating a spectrum of epidemic profiles from sub-exponential to exponential growth. By applying this model to 20 diverse real-world outbreaks, the study revealed significant variability in growth patterns, establishing sub-exponential growth as a prevalent phenomenon. These findings underscore the importance of considering 'deceleration parameters' to enhance the accuracy of mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasting.</p>

                    <p>The generalized-growth model successfully uncovered a wide range of epidemic growth patterns across different outbreaks, quantified by the parameter 'p'. Growth profiles varied significantly, from very slow sub-exponential (p=0.14 for Ebola in Bomi, Liberia) to near-exponential (p>0.9 for smallpox in Khulna). Crucially, the research established that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon across various infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the West African Ebola epidemic demonstrated substantial geographic variation in growth profiles, with district-level outbreaks exhibiting a range of p-values (0.14-0.97).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability of this model to accurately characterize early epidemic growth, particularly sub-exponential patterns, will lead to more precise disease forecasts. This improved predictive capability directly enhances clinical and public health responses by allowing for earlier and more targeted interventions (e.g., vaccine distribution, contact tracing, social distancing measures), better resource management, and a more accurate assessment of the effectiveness of implemented control strategies, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality during outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A better characterization of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission. We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of "deceleration parameters" may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.</p>
