                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel 2-parameter generalized-growth model designed to characterize the early ascending phase of infectious disease outbreaks, capturing a spectrum from sub-exponential to exponential growth. By applying this model to 20 diverse outbreaks, the research reveals significant variations in epidemic growth patterns and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common and crucial phenomenon for accurate disease forecasting.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurately characterizing the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is paramount for effective public health responses. This model enables better understanding of disease transmission drivers, leading to more precise forecasting, optimized resource allocation, and timely implementation of interventions, thereby mitigating the impact of outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the generalized-growth model itself is a mathematical model rather than an AI application, its findings significantly contribute to the foundations for AI-driven epidemiological forecasting and public health decision support systems. AI models designed for predicting outbreak trajectories, optimizing resource allocation during epidemics, or evaluating the impact of interventions could leverage the refined understanding of sub-exponential growth dynamics and deceleration parameters provided by this research for improved accuracy and robustness. The model provides critical parameters and insights that AI algorithms can incorporate or build upon for more sophisticated analyses.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The generalized-growth model successfully characterized a wide range of epidemic growth profiles, with the parameter 'p' reflecting significant variability across outbreaks. Observed profiles ranged from very slow sub-exponential (e.g., p=0.14 for Ebola in Bomi, Liberia) to near-exponential (e.g., p>0.9 for smallpox in Khulna, 1972). Notably, sub-exponential growth was identified as a common phenomenon. The West African Ebola epidemic analysis revealed substantial district-level growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97), underscoring the heterogeneity of outbreak dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Improved understanding and characterization of early epidemic growth patterns, especially the prevalence of sub-exponential growth, enable more accurate and reliable disease forecasting. This directly supports clinical and public health decision-making by allowing for better preparedness in healthcare systems (e.g., hospital capacity, medical supply chains), optimization of public health intervention strategies (e.g., timing of social distancing, vaccination campaigns, contact tracing), and more precise risk assessments for healthcare providers and affected communities.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the proposed generalized-growth model itself. However, the premise of the research highlights an implicit limitation in existing mathematical transmission models, which often assume exponential growth and may therefore provide inaccurate forecasts by failing to account for the commonly observed sub-exponential growth dynamics in early outbreak phases.</p>

                <p>Future research should focus on integrating the 'deceleration parameters' derived from this generalized-growth model into more complex, mechanistic mathematical transmission models. This integration is crucial for refining existing models and significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of disease forecasts, thereby enhancing preparedness and response strategies for future infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A better characterization of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission. We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of "deceleration parameters" may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.</p>
