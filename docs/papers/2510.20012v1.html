                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces an AI-based pose estimation pipeline for precise kinematic quantification in resistance training, comparing lengthened partial (pROM) and full (fROM) ranges of motion. It found that pROM repetitions had smaller ROM and shorter durations, especially during the eccentric phase, and identified participant-level variations as the primary driver of differences. The research proposes a novel, consistent metric, "%ROM", highlighting the utility of AI for advancing resistance training research and prescription.</p>

                    <p>Lengthened partial ROM repetitions consistently showed a smaller range of motion and shorter overall durations, predominantly due to a reduction in the eccentric phase of movement. Participant-level differences were the primary determinant of kinematic variation, rather than exercise-specific factors, despite the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects. A novel metric, "%ROM" (proportion of full ROM achieved), was introduced and demonstrated consistency across exercises, indicating a stable definition of lengthened partials.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.</p>
