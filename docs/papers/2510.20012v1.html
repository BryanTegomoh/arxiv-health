                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study introduces an AI-based pose estimation pipeline for precise kinematic quantification of resistance training, analyzing lengthened partial (pROM) and full range-of-motion (fROM) exercises. It reveals that pROM repetitions are characterized by smaller ROM and shorter durations, especially in the eccentric phase, with participant-level differences being the primary driver of variation. The research underscores the potential of AI-driven methods to advance exercise science and optimize resistance training prescription by providing objective insights into execution dynamics and consistency.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>An AI-based pose estimation pipeline was developed to extract frame-level joint-angle trajectories from video data of resistance training. These raw trajectories underwent filtering and smoothing, followed by the derivation of per-set metrics such as total range of motion (ROM), movement tempo, and specific durations for the concentric and eccentric phases. A random-effects meta-analytic model was then applied to statistically account for within-participant and between-exercise variability when comparing lengthened partial and full range-of-motion training. A new metric, %ROM, was also defined and analyzed for consistency.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers a powerful tool for individualized exercise prescription and monitoring in clinical settings. Physical therapists and sports medicine practitioners can leverage AI-driven kinematic analysis to: 1) precisely tailor rehabilitation protocols by specifying exact ROM and tempo, ensuring optimal recovery and injury prevention; 2) objectively evaluate patient progress and adherence to prescribed movement patterns; 3) provide quantitative feedback to athletes and patients to improve technique, enhance performance, and mitigate injury risk; and 4) standardize research on exercise interventions, leading to more robust and applicable clinical guidelines. This enables a more evidence-based and precise approach to resistance training in both therapeutic and performance-enhancement contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.</p>
