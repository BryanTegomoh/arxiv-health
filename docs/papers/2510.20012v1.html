                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to precisely quantify movement kinematics in resistance training, analyzing range-of-motion (ROM) variations in lengthened partial (pROM) versus full ROM (fROM) exercises. It found that pROM involved smaller ROM and shorter durations, particularly during the eccentric phase, with participant-level differences being the primary source of variability. The research introduces a novel, consistent metric, %ROM, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance research and personalize resistance training prescription.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.</p>
