                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops a 1-D mathematical model to analyze antibiotic resistance transfer and eradication in bacterial biofilms containing susceptible, persistor, and resistant strains via horizontal gene transfer. It evaluates various antibiotic dosing strategies, demonstrating that while continuous or periodic dosing often fail or require high concentrations, optimal control methods yield efficient, low-total-dose, tapered antibiotic schedules capable of ensuring bacterial elimination.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a theoretical framework to design more effective antibiotic treatment strategies for biofilm infections, a major clinical challenge due to inherent resistance and recalcitrance. By identifying optimal, low-dose regimens, it can help reduce antibiotic overuse, combat the rise of antimicrobial resistance, and improve patient outcomes in chronic or difficult-to-treat infections.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper uses traditional mathematical modeling and optimal control theory, the problem it tackles – optimizing complex antibiotic dosing schedules for efficacy and resistance management – is a prime candidate for future medical AI applications. AI/machine learning techniques, particularly reinforcement learning, could leverage such foundational models to develop adaptive, personalized antibiotic dosing regimens that learn from patient-specific data, pathogen dynamics, and real-world outcomes to achieve superior treatment efficacy, reduce antibiotic exposure, and mitigate resistance development in clinical settings.</p>

                    <p>High continuous or insufficient periodic antibiotic dosing often fails to eradicate biofilms or requires excessive drug levels. Optimal control analysis reveals that efficient bacterial elimination can be achieved with significantly lower total antibiotic doses through a strategically designed, tapered dosing schedule. This optimal tapered dosing protocol is qualitatively robust, suggesting its applicability across various biological conditions, and aligns with insights from existing clinical and modeling literature.</p>

                <p>The finding of an optimal tapered antibiotic dosing schedule has significant clinical impact, suggesting a paradigm shift from conventional continuous or simple periodic dosing. Implementing such tailored, dynamic dosing regimens could lead to more effective treatment of biofilm-associated infections, reduce the total antibiotic exposure, thereby mitigating the development of antibiotic resistance, and potentially improving patient recovery while minimizing drug-related side effects. It provides a scientific basis for personalized or adaptive antibiotic therapies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose and analyze a model for antibiotic resistance transfer in a bacterial biofilm and examine antibiotic dosing strategies that are effective in bacterial elimination. In particular, we consider a 1-D model of a biofilm with susceptible, persistor and resistant bacteria. Resistance can be transferred to the susceptible bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically via conjugation. We analyze some basic properties of the model, determine the conditions for existence of disinfection and coexistence states, including boundary equilibria and their stability. Numerical simulations are performed to explore different modeling scenarios and support our theoretical findings. Different antibiotic dosing strategies are then studied, starting with a continuous dosing; here we note that high doses of antibiotic are needed for bacterial elimination. We then consider periodic dosing, and again observe that insufficient levels of antibiotic per dose may lead to treatment failure. Finally, using an extended version of Pontryagin's maximum principle we determine efficient antibiotic dosing protocols, which ensure bacterial elimination while keeping the total dosing low; we note that this involves a tapered dosing which reinforces results presented in other clinical and modeling studies. We study the optimal dosing for different parameter values and note that the optimal dosing schedule is qualitatively robust.</p>
