                    <p>The study employed a fully automated approach beginning with the segmentation of the pancreas and other abdominal structures from CT images using four deep learning-based models. This segmentation was performed on an internal dataset of 584 patients. Following segmentation, Pancreatic Surface Lobularity (PSL) was automatically detected and derived as an imaging biomarker. The PSL values were then statistically compared between diabetic and non-diabetic patient groups. Finally, a multivariate model, trained with derived CT biomarkers, was used to predict the presence of T2DM, with its performance evaluated using metrics like AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a valuable tool for opportunistic T2DM screening that can be integrated into existing clinical workflows without requiring additional patient procedures or dedicated scans. By automatically analyzing CT scans, it offers a scalable, non-invasive method to identify individuals with T2DM or those at risk. This early detection capability could facilitate earlier lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and monitoring, potentially mitigating disease progression and its associated complications, thereby improving public health outcomes.</p>

                <p>The abstract explicitly notes this as "pilot work," indicating the preliminary nature of the findings. The study utilized an internal dataset of 584 patients, which might limit the generalizability of the results to broader, more diverse populations or different CT scanner protocols. Further validation on larger, external datasets is necessary to confirm the robustness and wider applicability of the proposed biomarker and predictive model.</p>

                <p>The findings suggest that PSL could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM, indicating a future direction for longitudinal studies to evaluate its utility in identifying pre-diabetic states or predicting future T2DM development. Further research should focus on validating these results in larger, more diverse patient cohorts and across different medical centers to ensure generalizability. Investigation into the specific biological mechanisms underlying increased pancreatic surface lobularity in T2DM would also be beneficial.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.</p>
