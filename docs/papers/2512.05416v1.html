                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Triplet-GCN, a novel single-branch graph convolutional network model designed for early sepsis prediction from complex, sparse, and heterogeneous Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. By representing EHR as patient-feature-value triplets and constructing a bipartite patient-feature graph, the model learns enriched patient embeddings, significantly outperforming traditional tabular machine learning baselines in discrimination and balanced error metrics for timely sepsis detection.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Triplet-GCN model processes EHR data by first converting patient encounters into 'patient-feature-value' triplets. These triplets are then used to construct a bipartite graph connecting patient nodes and feature nodes. Numeric features undergo median imputation and standardization, binary features are effect coded, and rare categorical features receive mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings. Patient nodes are initialized using summary statistics derived from their features, while the specific measurement values are retained on the edges connecting patient and feature nodes. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) then propagates information across this graph to learn patient embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for final sepsis prediction. The model was trained and tested on a 70/30 split of a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort.</p>

                <p>This model provides a simple, end-to-end blueprint for deployable sepsis risk stratification in intensive care units. Its ability to provide early warnings with improved accuracy and a better sensitivity-specificity trade-off can enable earlier clinical interventions, potentially leading to reduced morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with sepsis. The approach's robustness to sparse and heterogeneous EHR data makes it highly practical for real-world clinical deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In the intensive care setting, sepsis continues to be a major contributor to patient illness and death; however, its timely detection is hindered by the complex, sparse, and heterogeneous nature of electronic health record (EHR) data. We propose Triplet-GCN, a single-branch graph convolutional model that represents each encounter as patient-feature-value triplets, constructs a bipartite EHR graph, and learns patient embeddings via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve "who measured what and by how much". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70/30 train-test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity-specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning. These findings indicate that encoding EHR as triplets and propagating information over a patient-feature graph produce more informative patient representations than feature-independent models, offering a simple, end-to-end blueprint for deployable sepsis risk stratification.</p>
