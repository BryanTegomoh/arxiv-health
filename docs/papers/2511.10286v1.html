                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Athena, a histopathology foundation model trained on significantly fewer tissue patches (115 million) compared to other state-of-the-art models, by prioritizing data diversity over sheer scale. Athena achieved competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, suggesting that the diversity of whole-slide images, rather than just the quantity of patches, is the primary driver for effective learning in computational pathology.</p>

                    <li>The research challenges the prevailing paradigm in computational pathology that emphasizes training vision foundation models on increasingly vast numbers of tissue patches.</li>
                    
                    <li>Athena, the proposed foundation model, was initialized from a pretrained model and trained using only 115 million tissue patches, which is several times fewer than typical large-scale histopathology foundation models.</li>
                    
                    <li>The core methodological innovation is the focus on maximizing data diversity by randomly selecting a moderate number of patches per whole-slide image from a diverse internal repository.</li>
                    
                    <li>The repository for Athena's training data spans multiple countries, institutions, and scanner types, ensuring broad data variability.</li>
                    
                    <li>Athena was rigorously evaluated on one patch-level benchmark and four slide-level downstream tasks, encompassing both molecular and morphological predictions.</li>
                    
                    <li>Despite using significantly less training data, Athena approaches state-of-the-art performance and notably surpasses several existing models trained on substantially larger datasets.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study concludes that diversity across whole-slide images is a more critical factor for driving learning in histopathology foundation models than the total quantity of patches alone.</li>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Rapid progress in computational pathology is increasingly driven by vision foundation models pretrained on vast histopathology datasets. While recent efforts have prioritized training on an ever-larger amount of patches, we take an alternative approach focused on data diversity. Our foundation model, Athena, was initialized from a pretrained model and trained on just 115 million tissue patches, several times fewer than recent histopathology foundation models. Rather than relying on patch volume or complex sampling heuristics, we maximize data diversity by randomly selecting only a moderate number of patches per whole-slide image from our diverse internal repository, which spans multiple countries, institutions, and scanner types. Evaluated on a single patch-level benchmark and four slide-level downstream tasks (two molecular and two morphological), Athena approaches the state-of-the-art and even surpasses several models trained on substantially larger datasets. This indicates that diversity across whole-slide images, rather than patch quantity alone, drives learning in histopathology foundation models.</p>
