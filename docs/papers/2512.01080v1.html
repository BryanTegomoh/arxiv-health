                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the GIFTERS framework (Generalizable, Interpretable, Fair, Transparent, Explainable, Robust, Stable) for evaluating Trustworthy AI (TAI) in materials discovery, highlighting its broader applicability. A literature review in materials science revealed a median GIFTERS score of 5/7, indicating a significant lack of comprehensive trustworthiness reporting, with specific omissions in fairness for Bayesian studies and interpretability for non-Bayesian methods, emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop and integrated approaches.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This paper's GIFTERS framework for Trustworthy AI is critically important for medicine, where AI applications in diagnosis, treatment, drug discovery, and medical devices require unwavering confidence in their reliability, safety, fairness, and interpretability for both clinicians and patients, preventing potential harm and fostering adoption.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Although this paper does not describe an AI application *to* health, the 'Trustworthy AI' framework (GIFTERS principles) it defines and analyzes is directly applicable to medical AI. These principles are essential for ensuring that AI systems used in healthcare (e.g., for diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, or patient management) are reliable, fair, transparent, explainable, and safe. The paper's insights into building trustworthy AI, drawing from healthcare methodologies, can inform the development of more robust and ethically sound AI solutions in medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved defining a novel seven-principle framework (GIFTERS) for AI trustworthiness. This framework was then used to conduct a critical literature review within materials science to evaluate and quantify the extent to which reported AI/ML methods adhered to these principles, leading to a median GIFTERS score. Finally, the authors surveyed approaches from other scientific disciplines, including healthcare, to identify transferable methods for improving trustworthiness.</p>

                    <p>The key findings include the establishment of the GIFTERS framework as a comprehensive set of principles for AI trustworthiness, the discovery that current AI/ML research often lacks full trustworthiness (median score of 5/7), and the identification of specific deficiencies such as lack of fairness in Bayesian studies and lack of interpretability in non-Bayesian studies. The paper also highlights the value of cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer and the essential role of human-in-the-loop and uncertainty quantification.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Applying the GIFTERS framework in healthcare can lead to the development of more reliable and ethical medical AI tools, increasing clinician trust and patient safety. It can accelerate the regulatory approval process for AI-driven therapies and diagnostics by ensuring transparency and explainability. By addressing fairness, it can reduce health disparities exacerbated by biased AI, and by emphasizing robustness, it can ensure AI tools perform consistently across diverse patient populations and clinical settings, ultimately enhancing the adoption and utility of AI in clinical practice.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation noted in the abstract is that the quantitative assessment (median GIFTERS score) was derived from a literature review focused on the materials discovery community, meaning the specific numerical findings (e.g., 5/7 score, Bayesian vs. non-Bayesian omissions) are directly reflective of that domain. While the GIFTERS framework itself is broadly applicable, its empirical validation in medical/health literature would require a separate, focused review.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future directions involve implementing human-in-the-loop and integrated approaches to systematically bridge the gap between AI trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification across scientific disciplines. This includes further adapting and validating the GIFTERS framework for specific medical applications, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to transfer best practices from fields like healthcare to other scientific domains (and vice versa), and developing standardized reporting guidelines for trustworthiness in AI/ML research to ensure ethical and scientifically sound deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed "AI/ML". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community. This work provides a road map for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that will accurately and confidently enable material discovery.</p>
