                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research paper introduces an agent-based simulation framework that uses heterogeneous LLM agents, realistic demographics, and authentic social network topology to model political mobilization on social media. The framework successfully reproduces qualitative patterns of mobilization observed in landmark field experiments, particularly demonstrating stronger effects from social messaging and measurable peer spillovers. It offers a controlled, reproducible environment for exploring counterfactual designs in social influence research.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This simulation framework, while applied to political mobilization, is highly relevant to medicine and health by providing a robust methodology to understand how health-related information, public health messages, or even misinformation spreads through social networks and influences health behaviors. It can model the dynamics of peer influence crucial for vaccine uptake, lifestyle changes, and adoption of new medical advice at scale.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs an agent-based simulation framework. It assigns demographic attributes from U.S. Census data, political stances, and one of three LLM variants (GPT-4.1, Mini, Nano) representing political sophistication to each agent. These agents interact over a realistic Twitter network topology, receiving personalized feeds. The framework dynamically updates agents' engagement and voting intentions, replicating informational and social mobilization treatments of a prior field experiment.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The simulation successfully reproduced qualitative patterns observed in large-scale field experiments, including more pronounced mobilization effects when messages leveraged social connections (social message treatments) compared to purely informational ones. Furthermore, the model detected measurable peer spillover effects, indicating that the influence extends beyond directly targeted individuals to their social contacts. This demonstrates the framework's ability to realistically model complex social influence dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has significant potential to inform public health strategies. It could be adapted to simulate the spread of health information, model the effectiveness of different public health campaigns (e.g., vaccine promotion, disease prevention, healthy lifestyle encouragement) by testing various messaging strategies (informational vs. social influence) and their impact on health behaviors. It could also help identify mechanisms for rapid spread of health misinformation and aid in developing targeted interventions to mitigate its impact, thereby optimizing resource allocation for health communication efforts.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the abstract highlights the framework's strengths in reproducibility and controlled experimentation, an inherent limitation is its reliance on a simulated environment. The qualitative reproduction of patterns, while valuable, may not perfectly capture the nuanced quantitative effects or all unforeseen complexities of real-world human behavior in diverse health contexts. The fidelity of LLM agents to accurately model human health decision-making and susceptibility to influence requires further validation in health-specific applications.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research could adapt this framework to model specific health behaviors (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, chronic disease management adherence, mental health seeking behavior), integrating health-specific agent attributes like health literacy or trust in medical institutions. It could also be used to proactively test counterfactual public health interventions, identify optimal social network pathways for health message dissemination, and conduct sensitivity analyses on factors influencing health outcomes on social media platforms.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political
mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer
influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person
Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation
framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic
Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents
to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated
agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an
LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})
reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social
network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their
engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate
the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook
study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed
in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social
message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a
controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and
sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge
between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational
modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at
