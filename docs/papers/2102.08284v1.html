                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the chaotic dynamics observed in seasonally forced Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic models, which reflect the unpredictable fluctuations of common infectious diseases. It proposes and demonstrates the effectiveness of a phase control technique, interpreted as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy, to suppress this chaos and convert unpredictable motions into regular ones. The study highlights the crucial role of the phase difference between seasonal contact rates and vaccination efforts in achieving stable disease dynamics.</p>

This technique, interpreted as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy, successfully converts unpredictable disease dynamics into regular, predictable motions.

                <p>This research offers a theoretical basis for optimizing the timing and implementation of seasonal vaccination strategies to achieve stable and predictable disease incidence. It could inform public health policy by suggesting that subtle adjustments to vaccination schedules, specifically regarding their phase relative to natural seasonality, can significantly improve the control and predictability of infectious disease outbreaks, moving towards more stable endemic states rather than chaotic fluctuations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The study of epidemiological systems has generated deep interest in exploring the dynamical complexity of common infectious diseases driven by seasonally varying contact rates. Mathematical modeling and field observations have shown that, under seasonal variation, the incidence rates of some endemic infectious diseases fluctuate dramatically and the dynamics is often characterized by chaotic oscillations in the absence of specific vaccination programs. In fact, the existence of chaotic behavior has been precisely stated in the literature as a noticeable feature in the dynamics of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) seasonally forced epidemic model. However, in the context of epidemiology, chaos is often regarded as an undesirable phenomenon associated with the unpredictability of infectious diseases. As a consequence, the problem of converting chaotic motions into regular motions becomes particularly relevant. In this article, we consider the phase control technique applied to the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model to suppress chaos. Interestingly, this method of controlling chaos takes on a clear meaning as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy. Numerical simulations show that the phase difference between the two periodic forces - contact rate and vaccination - plays a very important role in controlling chaos.</p>
