                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the chaotic dynamics observed in seasonally forced Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic models. It demonstrates that a phase control technique, interpreted as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy, can effectively suppress these chaotic oscillations. The key finding is that the phase difference between the seasonal variations in contact rate and the timing of vaccination is a decisive factor in achieving regular, predictable disease dynamics.</p>

                <p>This study provides a theoretical framework for optimizing the timing and schedule of seasonal vaccination campaigns to stabilize disease dynamics and reduce the unpredictability of outbreaks. By understanding and leveraging the 'decisive phase effect', public health officials could potentially implement more effective vaccination strategies, leading to more predictable disease incidence, improved resource allocation (e.g., hospital beds, medical supplies), and ultimately, better public health outcomes and disease control.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The study of epidemiological systems has generated deep interest in exploring the dynamical complexity of common infectious diseases driven by seasonally varying contact rates. Mathematical modeling and field observations have shown that, under seasonal variation, the incidence rates of some endemic infectious diseases fluctuate dramatically and the dynamics is often characterized by chaotic oscillations in the absence of specific vaccination programs. In fact, the existence of chaotic behavior has been precisely stated in the literature as a noticeable feature in the dynamics of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) seasonally forced epidemic model. However, in the context of epidemiology, chaos is often regarded as an undesirable phenomenon associated with the unpredictability of infectious diseases. As a consequence, the problem of converting chaotic motions into regular motions becomes particularly relevant. In this article, we consider the phase control technique applied to the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model to suppress chaos. Interestingly, this method of controlling chaos takes on a clear meaning as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy. Numerical simulations show that the phase difference between the two periodic forces - contact rate and vaccination - plays a very important role in controlling chaos.</p>
