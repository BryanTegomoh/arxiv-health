                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework for clinical gait analysis, functioning as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor. Applied to a multi-cohort gait dataset, the framework's attention mechanism critically revealed a severe laterality bias in the data, assigning over 70% attention to the Right Foot for tasks requiring bilateral assessment due to underlying dataset confound, thereby demonstrating its ability to audit dataset integrity. It also proposes novel sensor synergies for future optimized protocols.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an attention-based deep learning framework designed for clinical gait analysis. It functions as both a sensor optimizer to improve data collection protocols for medical tasks (e.g., PD screening) and an automated data auditor to identify hidden biases in datasets used for training medical AI models, thereby ensuring their integrity and reliability for clinical use (e.g., ensuring accurate bilateral assessment for OA and CVA screening). It directly supports the development of robust and trustworthy AI for medical diagnostics and patient management.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework. This framework was trained and evaluated on the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset to perform four distinct clinical classification tasks. The internal attention mechanism of the model was then analyzed to quantitatively assess the contribution of different sensors and thereby identify underlying dataset biases and propose sensor synergies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary discovery was a severe laterality bias within the Voisard et al. (2025) public gait dataset for OA and CVA screening tasks. The model's attention mechanism disproportionately focused on the Right Foot (>70%) and ignored the Left Foot (<0.1%), directly reflecting an underlying dataset confound (e.g., predominantly right-sided pathology). A secondary finding included the proposal of novel, data-driven sensor synergies (e.g., Head plus Foot for PD screening) as potential optimized sensor configurations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to automatically audit datasets for inherent biases before AI model deployment is crucial, as it can prevent models from learning and perpetuating erroneous patterns, leading to more trustworthy and clinically relevant diagnostic and screening tools in gait analysis. Additionally, identifying optimized sensor protocols can reduce the number of sensors required, simplifying clinical procedures, potentially lowering costs, and improving patient comfort while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implicitly highlights a significant limitation of existing public datasets used for AI training in gait analysis, specifically concerning laterality and balanced representation of pathologies. While the proposed framework effectively identifies this data limitation, the abstract does not explicitly detail any limitations of the framework itself or its generalizability to other types of clinical data beyond gait.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.</p>
