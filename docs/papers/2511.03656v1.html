                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">With the rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies,
the demand for high-quality Chinese document question-answering datasets is
steadily growing. To address this issue, we present the Chinese Multi-Document
Question Answering Dataset(ChiMDQA), specifically designed for downstream
business scenarios across prevalent domains including academic, education,
finance, law, medical treatment, and news. ChiMDQA encompasses long-form
documents from six distinct fields, consisting of 6,068 rigorously curated,
high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs further classified into ten
fine-grained categories. Through meticulous document screening and a systematic
question-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high
quality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document
comprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally,
this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives,
construction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a
substantial foundation for future research and practical applications in
Chinese QA. The code and data are available at:
