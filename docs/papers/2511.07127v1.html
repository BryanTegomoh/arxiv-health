                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">REACT-LLM introduces a novel benchmark to systematically evaluate the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with causal features for enhancing clinical prognostic performance. The study reveals that while LLMs perform reasonably well in clinical prognostics, they currently do not outperform traditional machine learning models, and direct integration of causal features derived from discovery algorithms yields limited performance gains, primarily due to violated causal assumptions in complex clinical data. The benchmark, however, points towards a more promising, yet unspecified, synergy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential
for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly
understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their
integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying
features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and
trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal
reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their
causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk
prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical
prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning
(ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a
limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2
real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and
3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs
perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed
traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms
into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict
assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical
data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark
reveals a more promising synergy.</p>
