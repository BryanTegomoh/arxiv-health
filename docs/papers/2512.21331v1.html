                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">TICON is a novel transformer-based tile contextualizer designed to generate rich, context-aware embeddings from diverse tile-level foundation models in histopathology Whole Slide Images (WSI). It addresses the crucial need for slide-level contextual information by unifying and enhancing existing tile representations, leading to significant performance improvements across a wide array of computational pathology tasks. Notably, TICON enables the development of highly efficient slide-level foundation models that achieve state-of-the-art results with substantially less training data.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>TICON utilizes a transformer-based architecture as a shared encoder, specifically designed to act as a contextualizer for tile embeddings. It is pretrained using a masked modeling objective, where the model learns to infer or reconstruct masked tile features based on their surrounding context within a Whole Slide Image. This pretraining enables TICON to take embeddings from diverse, pre-existing tile-level pathology foundation models and output richer, contextually aware representations. Subsequently, an aggregator is pretrained on these TICON-contextualized embeddings to form a comprehensive slide-level foundation model.</p>

A key discovery is TICON's efficiency, as it enables a slide-level foundation model to achieve superior performance using only 11,000 WSIs, vastly outperforming models requiring up to 350,000 WSIs.</p>

                <p>TICON has the potential to profoundly impact clinical pathology by enabling the development of more accurate, robust, and data-efficient AI systems for WSI analysis. This could lead to faster and more consistent diagnoses for complex diseases like cancer, improved precision in disease grading and prognostication, and more personalized treatment strategies. Its ability to leverage existing tile encoders also facilitates integration into current digital pathology workflows, potentially accelerating the adoption of advanced AI in clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</p>
