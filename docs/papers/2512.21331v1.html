                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">TICON is a novel transformer-based model designed to contextualize and unify tile embeddings from whole slide images (WSIs), addressing the critical need for larger image context in computational pathology. By pretraining a shared encoder with a masked modeling objective, TICON generates rich, contextualized representations that significantly improve performance across diverse tile and slide-level tasks. This approach enables the creation of highly efficient and accurate slide-level foundation models using substantially less data than previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</p>
