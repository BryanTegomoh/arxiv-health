                    <li>The primary challenge in virtual screening for ultra-large combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) is their immense size (tens of billions), which severely limits the percentage of compounds that can be evaluated (often <0.1%).</li>
                    
                    <li>Traditional virtual screening algorithms struggle with amortization, offering little efficiency gain when computational objectives or constraints change during a campaign.</li>
                    
                    <li>APEX (Approximate-but-Exhaustive search protocol) employs a neural network surrogate model that capitalizes on the inherent structure of CSLs to predict computational objectives (e.g., docking scores) and constraints.</li>
                    
                    <li>This novel methodology enables the full enumeration of entire CSLs on a consumer GPU in less than a minute, facilitating the exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$ sets of compounds.</li>
                    
                    <li>A benchmark CSL comprising over 10 million compounds was developed and annotated with ground-truth docking scores across five medically relevant targets, along with RDKit physicochemical properties, for rigorous evaluation.</li>
                    
                    <li>APEX consistently demonstrated superior performance in both retrieval accuracy and runtime when compared to alternative virtual screening algorithms, validating its efficiency and effectiveness.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>APEX leverages a neural network surrogate model specifically designed to exploit the inherent combinatorial structure of CSLs. This model is trained to predict computational objectives (like docking scores) and various physicochemical constraints. Once trained, this surrogate allows for an approximate-but-exhaustive search, enabling the full enumeration of ultra-large libraries on a consumer GPU within seconds. The method was validated against a custom-built benchmark CSL containing over 10 million compounds, each pre-annotated with ground-truth docking scores for five medically relevant targets and RDKit-derived physicochemical properties, allowing for direct comparison of retrieved top-$k$ sets against the actual best compounds.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.</p>
