                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces APEX, an approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol designed to overcome the challenges of virtual screening in ultra-large make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) for drug discovery. APEX leverages a neural network surrogate that exploits CSL structure to predict objectives and constraints, enabling full library enumeration on a consumer GPU in under a minute. This allows for the rapid and accurate identification of approximate top-$k$ compounds, outperforming existing virtual screening methods in both retrieval accuracy and runtime.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>APEX employs a neural network (NN) surrogate model specifically designed to exploit the underlying structural regularities of combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs). This NN is trained to rapidly predict computational objectives, such as docking scores against specific protein targets, and physicochemical properties/constraints (measured with RDKit). By leveraging these NN predictions, APEX enables an approximate-but-exhaustive search across the entire CSL. The search is optimized for full enumeration on a consumer-grade GPU, achieving results in under a minute. A large benchmark CSL of over 10 million compounds was created, annotated with ground-truth docking scores for five medically relevant targets and physicochemical properties, to rigorously validate APEX's performance against existing virtual screening methods.</p>

                    <p>APEX consistently exhibits superior performance in both the accuracy of compound retrieval and computational runtime when compared to existing virtual screening methodologies.

                <p>By drastically improving the efficiency and accuracy of virtual screening, APEX has the potential to accelerate the early stages of drug development. This could lead to a significant reduction in the time and cost associated with identifying promising lead compounds, thereby speeding up the pipeline for novel therapeutics and potentially bringing more effective and targeted treatments to patients sooner across a broad spectrum of diseases.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the APEX method itself, but rather highlights the limitations of prior virtual screening approaches that APEX aims to overcome. A potential implicit limitation, given the 'approximate-but-exhaustive' nature, is the fidelity and generalization capability of the neural network surrogate model; the accuracy of its predictions directly influences the quality of the 'approximate top-$k$ sets' retrieved. Its performance might be sensitive to CSL structures or biological targets not well-represented in its training data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.</p>
