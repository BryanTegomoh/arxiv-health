                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative
approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics,
proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To
systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review
proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to
evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive
performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for
advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological
analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics
subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),
which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern
recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model
architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to
targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant
benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data
integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.
RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and
synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests
the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that
impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust
evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular
datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as
CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly
support the training and generalization of GenAI models.</p>
