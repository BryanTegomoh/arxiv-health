                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated a deep learning (DL) model to restore standard-dose contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern from simulated low-dose images. The DL model significantly improved image quality and segmentation performance, enabling lesion detection and diagnostic characterization with only 10-30% of the standard contrast agent dose.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reducing the contrast agent dose in MRI scans mitigates risks associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents, such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis or gadolinium retention, especially for patients with renal impairment or those requiring multiple follow-up scans. This technology offers a safer, potentially more cost-effective imaging option without compromising diagnostic quality.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI (deep learning) model is applied to enhance low-dose medical imaging data (MRI) to a quality comparable to standard-dose imaging. This enables reduced patient exposure to contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic utility, serving as an AI-powered image reconstruction and enhancement tool for safer and more efficient medical diagnostics.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This was a multi-center retrospective study involving 203 MRI examinations from 72 vestibular schwannoma patients. T1-weighted (T1) and standard contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1ce) MRI sequences were acquired. Low-dose T1ce images were simulated by digitally reducing the contrast agent effect on standard images. Deep learning models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from these simulated low-dose inputs. Image quality was quantitatively assessed using structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Segmentation performance for vestibular schwannoma was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient, 95% Hausdorff distance, and average surface distance. A head and neck radiologist provided a qualitative diagnostic assessment of the DL-restored images.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The DL model significantly improved the quantitative image quality of low-dose T1ce MRI. SSIM of restored images increased from 0.639 ± 0.113 to 0.993 ± 0.009, and PSNR increased from 21.6 ± 3.73 dB to 41.4 ± 4.84 dB as input dose increased. At 10% input dose, DL-restored T1ce improved segmentation performance, increasing the Dice score from 0.673 to 0.734, reducing the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Qualitatively, a radiologist rated DL-restored images from both 10% and 30% input doses as 'excellent,' with the 30% dose restoration being deemed 'more informative' for diagnostic characterization. This confirms the feasibility of lesion detection and diagnostic characterization in the CPA cistern with 10% to 30% of the standard contrast agent dose.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This DL model offers a significant advancement for contrast-enhanced MRI, particularly for the CPA cistern. Its adoption could substantially reduce the amount of gadolinium-based contrast agent administered to patients, leading to enhanced patient safety by minimizing potential adverse effects and accumulation, especially for individuals with renal impairment or those requiring frequent follow-up MRI scans for conditions like vestibular schwannoma. This could lead to a paradigm shift in MRI protocols, providing equivalent diagnostic information with a safer, lower-dose approach.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.</p>
