                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated a deep learning (DL) model to reduce the contrast agent dose for T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. The DL model successfully restored image quality and segmentation performance from simulated low-dose MRI, enabling diagnostic characterization with only 10% to 30% of the standard contrast agent dose.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medical imaging by demonstrating a method to significantly reduce the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in MRI. This can mitigate risks associated with GBCA accumulation (e.g., nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadolinium deposition) and adverse reactions, improving patient safety and expanding MRI accessibility for patients with renal impairment or those requiring frequent scans.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a deep learning model designed for medical image reconstruction and enhancement. It enables the use of significantly lower doses of contrast agents in MRI scans (specifically T1ce of the CPA cistern) while maintaining or improving diagnostic image quality for tasks like lesion detection and diagnostic characterization, thereby enhancing patient safety and potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with contrast agent usage.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This was a multi-center retrospective study involving T1 and T1ce MRI data from 72 vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients (203 MRI studies). Low-dose T1ce images were simulated from existing standard-dose T1 and T1ce scans by varying contrast agent dose reductions. Deep learning models were then trained to restore standard-dose T1ce images from these simulated low-dose inputs. Image quality was quantitatively assessed using structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Segmentation performance for VS was evaluated using Dice score, 95% Hausdorff distance (HD), and average surface distance (ASD). Additionally, a head and neck radiologist performed a qualitative evaluation of image quality and diagnostic characterization.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The DL model effectively restored image quality from simulated low-dose MRI. SSIM improved from 0.639 ± 0.113 (low input dose) to 0.993 ± 0.009 (high input dose), and PSNR increased from 21.6 ± 3.73 dB to 41.4 ± 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, DL-restored images significantly enhanced segmentation performance for VS, improving Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, 95% HD from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and ASD from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Radiologist assessment confirmed excellent image quality and diagnostic information from DL-restored images at both 10% and 30% of the standard dose, with 30% being considered more informative.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology has the potential to revolutionize contrast-enhanced MRI protocols by allowing for a substantial reduction (70-90%) in gadolinium contrast agent dose while preserving diagnostic accuracy for conditions like vestibular schwannoma. This would significantly reduce the risks of gadolinium-related complications for patients, decrease costs, and potentially allow for more frequent or safer imaging in vulnerable populations, such as those with renal insufficiency, without compromising diagnostic confidence.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study is retrospective and relies on simulated low-dose MRI data rather than prospectively acquired low-dose scans, which might not perfectly replicate real-world low-dose imaging artifacts. The qualitative evaluation was performed by a single radiologist, which could introduce bias. The focus was specifically on the CPA cistern and vestibular schwannoma patients, limiting immediate generalizability to other anatomical regions or pathologies.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should validate these findings with prospectively acquired low-dose MRI data in a larger, more diverse patient cohort. Multi-reader studies involving several radiologists are needed to further confirm diagnostic utility and inter-reader variability. Expanding the application of this DL model to other contrast-enhanced MRI indications and anatomical areas would also be a valuable next step.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.</p>
