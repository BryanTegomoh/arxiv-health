                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated a deep learning (DL) model designed to restore high-quality contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) images of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern from simulated low-dose acquisitions. The model significantly improved image quality and lesion segmentation performance, allowing for accurate diagnostic characterization with only 10% to 30% of the standard contrast agent dose. This innovation holds promise for reducing gadolinium exposure in patients requiring MRI of the CPA.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reducing the dose of gadolinium-based contrast agents minimizes the risk of side effects such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and gadolinium retention, particularly for patients with renal impairment or those requiring repeated MRI scans, thus enhancing patient safety while maintaining diagnostic efficacy.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI model (deep learning) is applied to reconstruct high-quality diagnostic images from low-dose contrast-enhanced MRI scans. This enables accurate lesion detection and diagnostic characterization (e.g., of vestibular schwannoma in the cerebellopontine angle cistern) using only 10% to 30% of the standard contrast agent dose, thereby enhancing patient safety by minimizing exposure to contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic efficacy.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 203 MRI examinations from 72 vestibular schwannoma patients. Standard non-contrast T1-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1ce) MRI images were utilized. Low-dose T1ce images were *simulated* by applying varying reductions to the standard contrast agent dose in existing T1ce data. Deep learning models were then trained to reconstruct (restore) the standard-dose T1ce images from these simulated low-dose inputs. The performance of the DL-restored images was evaluated using quantitative metrics for image quality (SSIM, PSNR) and segmentation performance (Dice coefficient, 95% Hausdorff distance, average surface distance), alongside a qualitative assessment by a head and neck radiologist for overall image quality and diagnostic utility.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The deep learning model significantly enhanced the image quality of simulated low-dose T1ce MRI, evidenced by SSIM values increasing from 0.639 to 0.993 and PSNR from 21.6 dB to 41.4 dB as the simulated input dose increased. Critically, for lesion segmentation, using DL-restored images from a mere 10% input dose improved the Dice coefficient from 0.673 to 0.734 and reduced the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm. Radiologist review confirmed that DL-restored images from both 10% and 30% input doses were diagnostically 'excellent', with the 30% dose providing superior diagnostic information.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a pathway to safely reduce the gadolinium contrast agent dose required for cerebellopontine angle MRI by 70-90% without compromising diagnostic quality. This has substantial clinical impact by mitigating risks associated with gadolinium exposure (e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency or those requiring frequent follow-up for conditions like vestibular schwannoma), potentially expanding MRI accessibility and improving patient safety in neuroradiological imaging.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, a potential implicit limitation is that the low-dose images were *simulated* rather than prospectively acquired with actual reduced contrast, which might not fully capture real-world noise characteristics or subtle artifacts introduced by lower contrast concentrations. Furthermore, the study focused on vestibular schwannoma, and generalizability to other CPA cistern pathologies would require further validation. The study's retrospective nature is also a limitation.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly mention future research directions. Implied future work could include prospective clinical validation of the DL model with actual low-dose contrast agent administration, evaluation of the model's performance across a broader spectrum of CPA cistern pathologies, and investigating its integration into clinical MRI workflows for real-time application.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.</p>
