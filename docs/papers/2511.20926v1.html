                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated a deep learning (DL) model to significantly reduce the contrast agent dose required for T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. The DL model successfully restored high-quality images from simulated low-dose acquisitions, enabling lesion detection and diagnostic characterization with only 10% to 30% of the standard contrast agent dose, as validated by both quantitative metrics and radiologist evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reducing contrast agent dose in MRI is crucial for patient safety, mitigating risks like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and gadolinium retention, especially for patients with renal impairment. This deep learning approach offers a pathway to maintain diagnostic image quality while significantly lowering patient exposure to contrast agents and potentially reducing costs.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using a deep learning model to reconstruct high-quality, standard-dose equivalent MRI images from low-dose contrast-enhanced scans. This enhances diagnostic capabilities in medical imaging while simultaneously reducing the patient's exposure to contrast agents, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare efficiency.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This was a multi-center retrospective study involving T1 and T1ce MRI data from 72 vestibular schwannoma patients. Low-dose T1ce images were simulated from existing standard-dose T1ce data. Deep learning models were then trained to restore these simulated low-dose images to standard-dose quality. The performance was evaluated quantitatively using structural similarity index measure (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and segmentation metrics (Dice, 95% Hausdorff distance, average surface distance), as well as qualitatively through diagnostic characterization by a head and neck radiologist.</p>

For 10% input dose, segmentation Dice score improved from 0.673 to 0.734, 95% Hausdorff distance reduced from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and average surface distance decreased from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm.

                <p class="abstract">Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.</p>
