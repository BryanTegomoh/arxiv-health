                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>xTime employs two core mechanisms: hierarchical knowledge distillation and a mixture of experts (MoE). Knowledge distillation is utilized to transfer valuable predictive information from 'teacher' models trained on more common (lower-rarity) events to 'student' models focusing on rarer, extreme events. The MoE mechanism then dynamically combines predictions from multiple 'expert' models, each potentially specialized for different event rarity levels, to generate a robust and accurate final forecast for the targeted extreme events.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.</p>
