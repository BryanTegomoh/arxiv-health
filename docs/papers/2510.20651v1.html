                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>xTime employs a two-pronged approach. First, it utilizes hierarchical knowledge distillation to transfer predictive capabilities. Models initially trained on more frequent, lower-rarity events act as teachers, imparting knowledge to student models focused on rarer, more extreme events, thereby mitigating data imbalance issues. Second, it integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism. This involves multiple expert models, each potentially specialized for different rarity levels of events. The MoE dynamically weighs and fuses their individual outputs to produce a robust and optimized final prediction for extreme events.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.</p>
