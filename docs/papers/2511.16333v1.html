                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The review highlights that World Models are actively being developed for longitudinal medical simulations, generative event forecasting from EHRs, and action-conditioned surgical guidance. However, most current implementations primarily offer basic temporal and action-conditioned prediction (L1-L2). Advanced capabilities like counterfactual evaluation (L3) and planning/control (L4) remain largely underdeveloped. Significant cross-cutting gaps identified include inadequate specification of action spaces and safety constraints, insufficient interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state representations, and limited uncertainty calibration at the trajectory level.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>World Models have the potential to significantly enhance clinical decision support by providing more accurate predictions of disease trajectories, simulating the outcomes of different interventions to guide treatment choices, and offering advanced guidance and control for complex procedures like robotic surgery. This could lead to more precise, effective, and safer personalized patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.</p>
