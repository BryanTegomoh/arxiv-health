                    <p>This is a review paper that surveys recent work on World Models applied to healthcare systems. It categorizes and analyzes existing research across three major medical domains, introduces a novel capability rubric to evaluate system maturity, and identifies cross-cutting gaps in current implementations.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The review found that World Models show promise by learning predictive dynamics reflecting the physical and causal structure of care. While most current World Model systems in healthcare achieve basic temporal (L1) and action-conditioned (L2) prediction, capabilities for complex counterfactual rollouts (L3) and full planning/control (L4) are significantly less common. Critical limitations in clinical reliability include inadequately defined action spaces, weak validation of interventions, incomplete multimodal state representations, and insufficient uncertainty calibration.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>World Models have the potential to significantly enhance clinical decision support by enabling accurate multistep predictions of disease progression, evaluating the outcomes of different treatment paths (counterfactuals), and providing action-conditioned guidance for interventions like robotic surgery. This can lead to more personalized, effective, and safer patient care by leveraging AI that understands the underlying causal dynamics of health.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.</p>
