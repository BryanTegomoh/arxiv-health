                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces PathCo-LatticE, a novel fully supervised Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for cardiac MRI segmentation that overcomes data scarcity and domain shift issues by leveraging pathology-guided synthetic supervision. It employs a Virtual Patient Engine to generate physiologically plausible 3D cohorts, a Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation protocol for leakage-free evaluation, and a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts for robust zero-shot generalization, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal labeled real data.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the development of a robust Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for segmenting cardiac MRI images. This involves using generative AI to create synthetic, pathology-guided medical data ('Virtual Patient Engine') to train models more effectively with limited real data. The aim is to enhance the diagnostic capabilities in cardiology by providing highly accurate and generalizable AI models for medical image analysis, enabling better detection and assessment of heart conditions from MRI scans, even for rare diseases or challenging out-of-distribution data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Few-shot learning (FSL) mitigates data scarcity in cardiac MRI segmentation but typically relies on semi-supervised techniques sensitive to domain shifts and validation bias, restricting zero-shot generalizability. We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available].</p>
