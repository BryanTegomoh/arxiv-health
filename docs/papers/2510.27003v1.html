                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper quantitatively analyzed over 1.1 million comments from r/PremierLeague (2013-2022) to map the evolution of its online fan community, focusing on sentiment, topics, and toxicity. The study revealed a significant expansion in discussion diversity but also a concerning rise in negative sentiment and toxicity over time. Furthermore, the subreddit has become a venue for users to voice frustrations about broader societal issues like racism, the COVID-19 pandemic, and political tensions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>The documented rise in online toxicity and negative sentiment, alongside the discussion of stressful societal issues like racism and pandemics within a large online community, highlights significant public health and mental health concerns. Exposure to such digital environments can contribute to chronic stress, anxiety, and potentially exacerbate psychological distress related to real-world events, impacting the mental well-being of users.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a foundation for AI applications in public health surveillance. AI models could be developed to monitor online communities for early detection of public sentiment, frustration, or misinformation related to health crises (e.g., pandemics), societal health issues (e.g., racism), or mental health stressors. Such AI applications could assist public health agencies in understanding community reactions, tailoring health communication strategies, or identifying populations experiencing distress related to health-impacting events or societal issues.</p>

                    <p>The study performed a quantitative review and analysis of over 1.1 million comments extracted from the r/PremierLeague subreddit.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The research found that the r/PremierLeague community experienced rapid expansion, leading to more diverse discussions. However, this growth was accompanied by a 'worrying rise' in both negative sentiment and overall toxicity within the comments. Critically, the subreddit also evolved into a platform for users to express frustrations and engage in discussions about broader societal issues, specifically mentioning racism, the COVID-19 pandemic, and political tensions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a basis for understanding how online community dynamics, particularly toxicity and negative discourse, can act as psychosocial stressors. Clinically, this knowledge can inform mental health professionals about potential online environmental factors contributing to anxiety, depression, or distress in individuals. Public health initiatives can leverage these insights to develop strategies for digital wellness, address online manifestations of health-related misinformation or stigma (e.g., related to pandemics or racism), and foster healthier online interactions to mitigate adverse mental health outcomes in online populations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Online communities for sports fans have surged in popularity, with Reddit's
r/PremierLeague emerging as a focal point for fans of one of the globe's most
celebrated sports leagues. This boom has helped the Premier League make
significant inroads into the US market, increasing viewership and sparking
greater interest in its matches. Despite the league's broad appeal, there's
still a notable gap in understanding its online fan community. Therefore, we
analyzed a substantial dataset of over 1.1 million comments posted from
2013-2022 on r/PremierLeague. Our study delves into the sentiment, topics, and
toxicity of these discussions, tracking trends over time, aiming to map out the
conversation landscape. The rapid expansion has brought more diverse
discussions, but also a worrying rise in negative sentiment and toxicity.
Additionally, the subreddit has become a venue for users to voice frustrations
about broader societal issues like racism, the COVID-19 pandemic, and political
tensions.</p>
