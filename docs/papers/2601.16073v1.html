                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DSFedMed tackles the challenge of deploying computationally intensive Foundation Models (FMs) in federated medical image segmentation by proposing a dual-scale framework. It leverages mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized FM and lightweight client models, supported by synthetic medical images and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy. This approach significantly boosts efficiency and performance, achieving a 2% Dice score improvement and a 90% reduction in communication costs and inference time.</p>

                <p>This research applies advanced AI (federated learning, foundation models, knowledge distillation) to automate and improve medical image segmentation. This application allows for the precise delineation of anatomical structures, tumors, lesions, or other regions of interest from medical scans (e.g., MRI, CT, X-ray).

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DSFedMed employs a dual-scale federated learning architecture. It facilitates mutual knowledge distillation where a large, centralized Foundation Model (FM) transfers its general learned representations to smaller, lightweight models deployed at client sites. Concurrently, the lightweight client models provide distilled, client-specific insights back to refine the central FM. To support this distillation, the framework uses a set of high-quality synthetic medical images, replacing the need for real public datasets. A learnability-guided sample selection strategy is implemented to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of this dual-scale distillation process.</p>

                <p>DSFedMed offers a pathway to integrate highly performant Foundation Models into clinical practice for medical image analysis, particularly in settings constrained by data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), limited computational resources, or slow network infrastructure. By enabling efficient segmentation with reduced communication and inference times, it can accelerate diagnostic workflows, support more widespread deployment of AI tools in hospitals and clinics, and potentially lead to more accurate and timely diagnoses across diverse patient populations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.</p>
