                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DSFedMed proposes a novel dual-scale federated framework addressing the high computational and communication demands of deploying Foundation Models (FMs) in federated medical image segmentation.

This approach significantly improves segmentation accuracy by 2% (Dice score) while reducing communication and inference costs by nearly 90% compared to existing federated FM baselines.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DSFedMed is a dual-scale federated framework comprising a centralized Foundation Model (FM) and distributed Lightweight Client Models (LCMs). It employs mutual knowledge distillation: the FM transfers general knowledge to the LCMs, which in turn refine the FM with client-specific insights. To facilitate distillation without real public data, high-quality synthetic medical images are generated. A learnability-guided sample selection strategy is implemented to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of this distillation process. The framework was evaluated on five diverse medical imaging segmentation datasets.</p>

                <p>DSFedMed has the potential to enable the widespread adoption of powerful Foundation Models in clinical practice, even in resource-constrained environments. By improving segmentation accuracy and reducing computational/communication overhead, it can lead to faster and more precise diagnoses, better-informed treatment planning (e.g., tumor contouring for radiation therapy), and more efficient clinical workflows, ultimately benefiting patient care and outcomes. Its privacy-preserving nature, using federated learning and synthetic data, aligns well with stringent healthcare data regulations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.</p>
