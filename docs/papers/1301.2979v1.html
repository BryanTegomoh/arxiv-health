                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a mathematical model exploring indirect transmission of infectious diseases via an environmental pathogen reservoir, highlighting the critical role of the pathogen lifespan to infectious state duration ratio in determining disease dynamics. It demonstrates that a seasonally forced pathogen inactivation rate introduces a time delay between peak environmental pathogen survival and peak disease incidence, with the observed periodicity matching the seasonal forcing and being independent of acquired immunity.</p>

                    <li>The ratio of the pathogen's lifespan in the environment to the duration of the infectious disease state is identified as a critical parameter in determining the overall disease dynamics.</li>
                    
                    <li>The introduction of a seasonally forced pathogen inactivation rate within the model identifies a consistent time delay between the peak of environmental pathogen survival and the subsequent peak in human disease incidence.</li>
                    
                    <li>This observed time delay is dependent on specific disease parameters and, notably for influenza, is found to decrease with an increasing reproduction number (R0).</li>

                    <p>The study employs a mathematical modeling approach to simulate the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease.

                    <p>The critical parameter governing disease dynamics is the ratio of pathogen lifespan to the duration of the infectious state. Seasonal pathogen inactivation rates introduce a time delay between peak environmental pathogen survival and peak disease incidence, a delay that decreases with increasing reproduction number for diseases like influenza. The periodicity of disease oscillations precisely matches the seasonal forcing and is independent of acquired immunity duration.</p>

                <p>The ability to identify and quantify the time delay between environmental pathogen peaks and human disease incidence could significantly enhance outbreak prediction for diseases with environmental transmission. This knowledge could optimize the timing of public health interventions, such as vaccination campaigns, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., promoting hygiene during specific periods), and resource allocation in healthcare systems, particularly for seasonal respiratory illnesses like influenza.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The annual occurrence of many infectious diseases remains a constant burden to public health systems. The seasonal patterns in respiratory disease incidence observed in temperate regions have been attributed to the impact of environmental conditions on pathogen survival. A model describing the transmission of an infectious disease by means of a pathogenic state capable of surviving in an environmental reservoir outside of its host organism is presented in this paper. The ratio of pathogen lifespan to the duration of the infectious disease state is found to be a critical parameter in determining disease dynamics. The introduction of a seasonally forced pathogen inactivation rate identifies a time delay between peak pathogen survival and peak disease incidence. The delay is dependent on specific disease parameters and, for influenza, decreases with increasing reproduction number. The observed seasonal oscillations are found to have a period identical to that of the seasonally forced inactivation rate and which is independent of the duration of infection acquired immunity</p>
