                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation, where initial mask proposals are generated by a supervised base segmenter. Noisy automatic quality-control signals serve as 'judges' to establish preference pairs between these proposals. The core method is Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), which modifies the standard DPO objective by incorporating a normalization factor based on the size of the disagreement region (symmetric difference) between the preferred and rejected segmentation masks in each preference pair, thereby re-weighting updates to enhance robustness against judge noise.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Standard DPO for segmentation is highly sensitive to the quality of noisy judges and the method of preference pair mining, exhibiting amplified errors with unreliable signals. RN-DPO, by normalizing preference updates based on mask disagreement region sizes, significantly improves sustained segmentation performance and provides enhanced stability during preference-based fine-tuning. It consistently outperforms standard DPO and other strong baselines across multiple medical datasets and varying noise conditions, all without requiring additional pixel-level ground-truth annotations.</p>

This can accelerate the adoption of advanced AI in medical imaging, leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses, improved treatment planning, and ultimately better patient care by enabling robust and scalable AI model deployment with existing clinical data streams.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, potential limitations could include the initial requirement for a small labeled dataset to train the base segmenter, the inherent quality ceiling determined by the base segmenter's proposal generation capabilities, and the implicit assumption that the noisy QC signals provide a sufficiently informative, albeit imperfect, preference signal. The generalizability might also depend on the specific nature and biases of the QC signals employed in different clinical contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">While dense pixel-wise annotations remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation, they are costly to obtain and limit scalability. In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.</p>
