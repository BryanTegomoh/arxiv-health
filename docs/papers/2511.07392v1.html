                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In da Vinci robotic surgery, surgeons' hands and eyes are fully engaged in
the procedure, making it difficult to access and manipulate multimodal patient
data without interruption. We propose a voice-directed Surgical Agent
Orchestrator Platform (SAOP) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework,
consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine,
validate, and reason to map voice commands into specific tasks such as
retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D
anatomical models on the surgical video. We also introduce a Multi-level
Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) to comprehensively assess the
performance and robustness from command-level and category-level perspectives.
The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands,
while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and
diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to
support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.</p>
