                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigated the use of kinematic data and machine learning to predict gait scores in non-clinically lame dairy cows, aiming for early detection of walking pattern abnormalities. By quantifying specific gait attributes from 3D marker data, a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model was developed, achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.65 in predicting categorized gait scores on a test set. The research contributes to developing automated monitoring systems for enhancing dairy cow welfare and longevity.</p>

                    <p>Kinematic data were acquired from 20 anatomical markers on 12 non-clinically lame dairy cows during 69 passages through a corridor, recorded by six cameras. From these 3D coordinates, specific gait attributes of the hoof markers were computed.

The dataset was split 70:30 into stratified training and testing sets. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were trained using k-fold repeated cross-validation. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian optimization. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and balanced accuracy.</p>

                <p>This study offers a crucial foundation for developing practical, automated monitoring systems capable of objectively identifying subtle gait abnormalities in dairy cows at an early stage. Such systems could enable timely intervention, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of clinical lameness, thereby improving animal welfare, extending productive lifespan, and enhancing farm sustainability by mitigating economic losses associated with lameness.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>A notable limitation was the sparse distribution of extreme gait scores in the dataset, with only one observation below NRS 2 and six observations above NRS 3. This necessitated combining the original 5-point NRS labels into three broader categories, which may limit the model's ability to differentiate very subtle or very severe lameness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Detecting walking pattern abnormalities in dairy cows early on holds the potential to reduce the occurrence of clinical lameness. This study aimed to predict gait scores in non-clinically lame dairy cows by using gait attributes based on kinematic data. Markers were placed on 20 anatomical landmarks on 12 dairy cows. The cows were walked multiple times through a corridor while recorded by six cameras, representing 69 passages. Specific gait attributes were computed from the 3D coordinates of the hoof markers. Gait was visually assessed using a 5-point numerical rating system (NRS). Due to the limited number of observations with NRS lower than 2 (n = 1) and higher than 3 (n = 6), the NRS labels were combined into three groups, representing NRS <= 2, NRS = 2.5, and NRS >= 3. The dataset was split into training and testing sets (70:30 ratio), stratified by the distribution of the NRS categories. Random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBM), and support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis kernel models were trained using k-fold repeated cross-validation with hyperparameters defined using a Bayesian optimization. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and balanced accuracy were calculated to measure model performance. The GBM model performed best, achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.65 in the testing set. The findings of this study contribute to the development of an automated monitoring system for early identification of gait abnormalities, thereby enhancing the welfare and longevity of dairy cows.</p>
