                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>LNMBench is a comprehensive benchmark framework. It systematically evaluates 10 representative learning with noisy labels (LNL) methods on 7 distinct medical datasets, covering 6 different imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, X-ray, histopathology). The evaluation simulates realistic conditions by employing 3 noise patterns. The framework assesses performance degradation under high and real-world noise, specifically analyzing the impact of class imbalance and domain variability. A simple yet effective improvement strategy is also proposed and tested within this benchmarking framework.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Learning from noisy labels remains a major challenge in medical image analysis, where annotation demands expert knowledge and substantial inter-observer variability often leads to inconsistent or erroneous labels. Despite extensive research on learning with noisy labels (LNL), the robustness of existing methods in medical imaging has not been systematically assessed. To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions. The LNMBench codebase is publicly released to facilitate standardized evaluation, promote reproducible research, and provide practical insights for developing noise-resilient algorithms in both research and real-world medical applications.The codebase is publicly available on https://github.com/myyy777/LNMBench.</p>
