                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a proof-of-concept for integrating public health ethics frameworks directly into computational models used to inform infectious disease interventions. It demonstrates how explicitly incorporating diverse values, such as outcome equity and aggregate benefit, reveals significant value trade-offs, leading to different optimal intervention strategies depending on the prioritized ethical framework. This approach aims to enhance the ethical robustness of public health decision-making by moving beyond purely epidemiological outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for advancing ethical decision-making in public health, especially during infectious disease crises. By explicitly incorporating ethical values into predictive models, it ensures that interventions are not solely based on epidemiological efficiency but also consider broader societal impacts like equity, leading to more just and socially acceptable health policies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes the integration of ethical frameworks into 'computational modelling' for evaluating and optimizing public health interventions. While not explicitly using the term 'AI', this approach aligns with the application of computational decision support systems in health. Such systems, particularly those that handle complex multi-objective optimization ('optimal strategies'), scenario analysis, and the incorporation of qualitative values ('outcome equity', 'aggregate benefit', 'ethical frameworks') into quantitative models, often leverage or can be enhanced by AI/machine learning techniques for predictive modeling, policy recommendation, and ethical AI development in a health context.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilizes a proof-of-concept approach, embedding specific public health values (e.g., outcome equity, aggregate benefit) into the evaluation metrics of a simplified computational model. This model simulates vaccination interventions for a hypothetical pathogen akin to SARS-CoV-2.

                    <p>The main discovery is the presence of significant value trade-offs: the identification of an 'optimal' public health intervention strategy is highly dependent on the particular ethical framework or the relative prioritization of values chosen (e.g., prioritizing equitable outcomes versus maximizing aggregate population benefit). This demonstrates that ethical considerations can fundamentally alter the recommended policy, underscoring the need for their explicit inclusion.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work holds the potential to significantly improve the ethical quality and societal acceptance of public health policies. It provides a structured framework for public health officials and policymakers to explicitly analyze and articulate the ethical implications of different intervention strategies, fostering transparency and facilitating more equitable resource allocation and intervention design during outbreaks and beyond. This could lead to better-informed and more defensible public health decisions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Decisions on public health interventions to control infectious disease are often informed by computational models. Interpreting the predicted outcomes of a public health decision requires not only high-quality modelling, but also an ethical framework for assessing the benefits and harms associated with different options. The design and specification of ethical frameworks matured independently of computational modelling, so many values recognised as important for ethical decision-making are missing from computational models. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept approach to incorporate multiple public health values into the evaluation of a simple computational model for vaccination against a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. By examining a bounded space of alternative prioritisations of values (outcome equity and aggregate benefit) we identify value trade-offs, where the outcomes of optimal strategies differ depending on the ethical framework. This work demonstrates an approach to incorporating diverse values into decision criteria used to evaluate outcomes of models of infectious disease interventions.</p>
