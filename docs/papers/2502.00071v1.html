                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a proof-of-concept method to integrate public health ethical frameworks directly into the evaluation of computational models for infectious disease interventions. By examining trade-offs between values like outcome equity and aggregate benefit in a vaccination model, it demonstrates how optimal strategies vary depending on the ethical priorities, offering a more ethically nuanced approach to public health decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work is crucial for developing public health interventions that are not only effective in controlling disease but also ethically sound and socially equitable. It ensures that critical decisions, such as vaccine allocation or lockdown measures, consider broader societal values beyond just infection rates, leading to more acceptable and just health outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research describes a computational modeling approach to evaluate outcomes of infectious disease interventions based on various ethical values (e.g., outcome equity, aggregate benefit). This falls under the application of computational methods (which can include AI/ML techniques) for decision support in public health and healthcare. Specifically, it involves using models to inform optimal strategies for interventions like vaccination, considering complex trade-offs, which is a key application area for AI/computational intelligence in health.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a proof-of-concept approach, integrating pre-defined public health ethical values (specifically outcome equity and aggregate benefit) into the evaluation framework of a simple computational model. This model simulated vaccination interventions against a pathogen akin to SARS-CoV-2. The methodology involved exploring a 'bounded space of alternative prioritisations of values' to identify how different ethical weightings influenced optimal intervention strategies.</p>

This integration revealed significant value trade-offs, where the identification of an 'optimal' strategy was directly dependent on the specific ethical framework and the prioritization given to values such as outcome equity versus aggregate benefit.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to profoundly impact clinical and public health decision-making by providing tools to evaluate interventions not just on epidemiological efficacy, but also on their ethical implications and societal fairness. It can lead to the design of more just and acceptable intervention strategies, particularly in resource allocation during pandemics, fostering greater public trust and compliance.</p>

The exploration of a 'bounded space of alternative prioritisations of values' also implies a simplified analysis compared to the full complexity of real-world ethical dilemmas.</p>

This would likely involve applying the approach to more complex and realistic epidemiological models, expanding the range of incorporated ethical values, developing more sophisticated methods for weighting these values, and integrating the framework into decision-support tools for real-world public health policy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Decisions on public health interventions to control infectious disease are often informed by computational models. Interpreting the predicted outcomes of a public health decision requires not only high-quality modelling, but also an ethical framework for assessing the benefits and harms associated with different options. The design and specification of ethical frameworks matured independently of computational modelling, so many values recognised as important for ethical decision-making are missing from computational models. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept approach to incorporate multiple public health values into the evaluation of a simple computational model for vaccination against a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. By examining a bounded space of alternative prioritisations of values (outcome equity and aggregate benefit) we identify value trade-offs, where the outcomes of optimal strategies differ depending on the ethical framework. This work demonstrates an approach to incorporating diverse values into decision criteria used to evaluate outcomes of models of infectious disease interventions.</p>
