                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the concept of a 'Jordan-segmentable mask,' a topology-aware definition for binary image segmentation evaluation. It proposes a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, digital topology, and homology theory to assess whether a segmentation correctly partitions an image into two topologically separate, connected regions. This addresses limitations of conventional metrics that often fail to capture structural coherence and connectivity crucial for accurate object delineation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In medical imaging, accurate object delineation (e.g., organs, tumors, lesions) relies heavily on preserving the global shape and connectivity. This work provides a crucial tool to ensure that AI-driven segmentations maintain topological correctness, preventing small errors in boundaries, holes, or fragmentations from leading to misinterpretations or incorrect clinical decisions, which can have significant patient impact.</p>

                <p>This research provides a fundamental tool for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models in healthcare, particularly those involved in medical image segmentation. By introducing a 'Jordan-segmentatable mask' concept and a 'topology-aware notion of segmentation,' it offers a rigorous, unsupervised criterion to assess the structural coherence of AI-generated segmentation masks.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.</p>
