                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research introduces a novel deep learning framework that combines neural registration and autoencoders to predict a patient-specific healthy tibia reconstruction from a fractured CT scan. The system assists surgical planning by transforming raw CTs to a standardized coordinate system and then generating a prediction of the intact bone, critically designed to be robust to masked (fractured) input.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This technology provides a crucial tool for surgeons planning complex tibial fracture repairs, offering a patient-specific 3D reconstruction target that can significantly improve the accuracy of alignment, potentially leading to better surgical outcomes and reduced operative time.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using neural registration (a modified spatial transformer network) and autoencoder models to process CT images of fractured tibias. The AI system learns to register raw CTs to a standardized coordinate system and model healthy tibial variations. It can then take a fractured CT scan, handle masked input, and predict / decode a patient-specific healthy bone structure, which serves as a target for surgical reconstruction planning. This directly aids surgeons in visualizing and achieving optimal bone alignment.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology combines two deep learning components: 1) A 3D-adapted Spatial Transformer Network (STN) is initially trained to perform global spatial registration, transforming raw CT images of tibiae into a standardized coordinate system aligned with a learned tibia prototype. This step standardizes the orientation and position of the bone. 2) Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model the statistical variations of healthy tibial anatomy within this standardized coordinate space. Crucially, both the STN and AE models are explicitly designed to be robust to masked input, allowing them to effectively process CT scans where parts of the bone are missing or fractured. This enables the system to take a fractured tibia CT, register it, and then use the AE to generate a predictive 3D model of what the patient's healthy, intact tibia would look like in the standardized coordinates.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The key findings include the successful development and adaptation of a 3D Spatial Transformer Network for robust global spatial registration of bone CTs. Furthermore, the research demonstrates the efficacy of autoencoder architectures in modeling the complex variations of healthy tibial anatomy. A significant finding is the extension of both registration and generative models to handle masked inputs, which is essential for applying these methods to real-world fractured bone images, thus enabling the predictive generation of patient-specific healthy bone structures from damaged scans.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by providing orthopedic and trauma surgeons with an advanced computational tool for preoperative planning of complex tibial fractures. By offering a patient-specific 3D visualization of the desired healthy bone alignment, it can reduce the subjective challenges of imagining the optimal reconstruction. This could lead to more precise fracture reduction, improved implant placement, shorter surgical times, and ultimately, better functional outcomes and reduced complications for patients undergoing tibial fracture repair.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Surgical planning for complex tibial fractures can be challenging for surgeons, as the 3D structure of the later desirable bone alignment may be diffi- cult to imagine. To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.
