                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using neural registration (Spatial Transformer Networks) and autoencoder models to process CT images of fractured tibias.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology integrates a modified 3D Spatial Transformer Network (STN) for global spatial registration and various autoencoder (AE) architectures. The STN maps raw CTs of tibias to a standardized coordinate system defined by a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, AEs are trained to model the healthy morphological variations of the tibia within this standardized space. A key innovation is designing both the STN and AE models to be robust to 'masked input,' meaning they can process CT scans with fractures or missing bone segments. This allows the system to receive a fractured tibia CT, register it, and then decode a prediction of the patient's specific healthy bone structure in the standard coordinate system.</p>

                    <p>The paper demonstrates the successful adaptation and implementation of a 3D STN for robust global spatial registration of bone CTs. It also shows that autoencoder models can effectively capture and represent healthy tibial anatomical variations. Crucially, the research confirms the ability of both the registration and autoencoding models to handle masked (fractured) input, enabling accurate predictive generation of healthy bone structures. A comparative analysis of different AE architectures further supports their utility in bone CT modeling.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Surgical planning for complex tibial fractures can be challenging for surgeons, as the 3D structure of the later desirable bone alignment may be diffi- cult to imagine. To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.
