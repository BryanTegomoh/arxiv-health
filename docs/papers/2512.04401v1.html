                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a deep learning model for reconstructing 2D dielectric breast images using time-domain microwave signals. A key innovation is the integration of antenna positioning into the processing pipeline, enabling a conformal antenna array that adapts to individual breast sizes. This approach aims to eliminate signal attenuation in coupling liquid common with fixed arrays and allows the neural network to focus on image reconstruction within the region of interest by pre-estimating the breast surface, demonstrating good quality image reconstruction in numerical results.</p>

                <p>This technology holds the potential to significantly improve breast cancer detection by providing a patient-specific, non-invasive, and non-ionizing imaging modality. It could lead to earlier and more accurate diagnosis, especially for breasts with varying densities, potentially reducing the need for ionizing radiation from mammography and enhancing patient comfort by adapting to breast shape rather than requiring compression. It offers a promising avenue for a new generation of microwave breast imagers.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A deep learning model is proposed for reconstructing 2D dielectric breast images from time-domain signals. Unlike existing learning models that employ a fixed antenna array, where input data consists solely of measurements, the proposed system integrates antenna positioning into the processing pipeline. This allows for a conformal antenna array that adapts to different breast sizes for optimal data collection across various patients, which eliminates undesired signal attenuation in coupling liquid when implemented for the fixed array. By leveraging antenna positions, the breast surface can be pre-estimated, enabling the neural network to focus on image reconstruction within the region of interest. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model may reconstruct breast images with good quality.</p>
