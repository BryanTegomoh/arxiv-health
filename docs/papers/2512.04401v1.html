                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a deep learning model for reconstructing 2D dielectric breast images from time-domain signals, distinguishing itself by integrating a conformal antenna array. Unlike fixed array systems, this approach incorporates antenna positioning into the processing pipeline, allowing the array to adapt to various breast sizes for optimal data collection. Numerical results indicate that this method, by enabling the neural network to focus on a pre-estimated breast surface within the region of interest, can reconstruct breast images with good quality.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A deep learning model is proposed for reconstructing 2D dielectric breast images from time-domain signals. Unlike existing learning models that employ a fixed antenna array, where input data consists solely of measurements, the proposed system integrates antenna positioning into the processing pipeline. This allows for a conformal antenna array that adapts to different breast sizes for optimal data collection across various patients, which eliminates undesired signal attenuation in coupling liquid when implemented for the fixed array. By leveraging antenna positions, the breast surface can be pre-estimated, enabling the neural network to focus on image reconstruction within the region of interest. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model may reconstruct breast images with good quality.</p>
