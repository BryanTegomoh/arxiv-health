                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.</p>
