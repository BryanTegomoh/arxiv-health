                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel two-agent neuro-symbolic framework designed for context-aware Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) forecasting, which integrates semantic reasoning into probabilistic predictions. It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for interpreting diverse contextual signals and a neuro-symbolic core for combining this interpretation with historical data. The framework demonstrates competitive point forecasting accuracy, robust 90% prediction intervals, and human-interpretable rationales on real-world HFMD datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on a two-agent neuro-symbolic framework. An LLM-based 'event interpreter' module semantically processes diverse, heterogeneous signals (e.g., school schedules, weather data, reports) to derive a scalar 'transmission-impact signal'. This signal is then fed into a 'neuro-symbolic core' that combines it with historical HFMD case counts to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts, including 90% prediction intervals. The framework was evaluated using real-world HFMD datasets from specific geographical regions over defined periods.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.
