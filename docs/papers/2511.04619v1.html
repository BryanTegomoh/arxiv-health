                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the limitations of static causal discovery methods in analyzing dynamic diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) by proposing a latent pseudotime model. This model infers a data-driven disease trajectory, enabling the discovery of evolving causal relationships between AD markers. The pseudotime significantly outperforms chronological age in predicting AD diagnosis and benefits from integrating background knowledge to reveal dynamic interactions among novel and established biomarkers.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for advancing our understanding of Alzheimer's disease progression by revealing the dynamic and evolving causal relationships between key biomarkers. It offers a more precise way to stage the disease and identify potential points for targeted intervention beyond chronological age.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper applies advanced statistical/machine learning models (latent variable models, causal discovery, pseudotime modelling) to medical data from Alzheimer's disease patients. This constitutes a medical AI application aimed at: 1) predicting disease diagnosis more accurately (demonstrated by AUC 0.82 vs 0.59), 2) understanding the causal relationships and dynamic interactions between biomarkers in disease progression, and 3) establishing a data-driven disease trajectory independent of age. This provides valuable insights for diagnostic tools, prognostic markers, and understanding the complex pathophysiology of AD.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized an existing latent variable model, applied to real-world Alzheimer's disease patient data. This model inferred a latent 'pseudotime,' which served to order patients along a data-driven disease trajectory, independent of their chronological age. Subsequently, the methodology involved learning how causal relationships among various AD markers evolve along this inferred pseudotime. The framework also incorporated minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge to enhance the accuracy and orientation of the derived causal graphs.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is that the inferred pseudotime significantly outperformed chronological age in predicting AD diagnosis, with an AUC of 0.82 versus 0.59. Integrating minimal background knowledge substantially improved causal graph accuracy and orientation. The framework successfully identified dynamic interactions among both novel biomarkers like NfL and GFAP, and established AD markers, providing insights into their evolving roles throughout the disease trajectory.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has the potential to significantly improve AD diagnosis and prognosis by providing a more accurate, data-driven measure of disease progression (pseudotime) than chronological age. Identifying dynamic causal relationships between biomarkers could lead to more precise patient stratification, facilitate the development of stage-specific therapeutic interventions, and enable earlier, more targeted interventions based on the evolving pathology, ultimately enhancing personalized medicine for AD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</p>
