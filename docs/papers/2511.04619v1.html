                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel application of an existing latent variable model to uncover dynamic causal relationships in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inferring a 'pseudotime' that reflects a data-driven disease trajectory. This pseudotime significantly outperforms chronological age in predicting AD diagnosis and, when combined with minimal background knowledge, enables the discovery of evolving causal interactions between AD biomarkers.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for understanding the dynamic progression of Alzheimer's disease, enabling the identification of evolving causal pathways and potentially leading to more accurate diagnostic or prognostic markers independent of chronological age.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research applies machine learning techniques, specifically latent variable models and dynamic causal discovery, to real-world Alzheimer's disease data. This constitutes a medical AI application aimed at inferring a data-driven disease trajectory (pseudotime) for patients, which is shown to be a superior predictor for AD diagnosis compared to chronological age. Furthermore, it uses AI/computational methods to learn and reveal how causal relationships between various AD markers evolve over the course of the disease, providing insights into pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. This directly contributes to understanding, diagnosing, and potentially managing AD using advanced analytical tools.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</p>
