                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel dynamic causal discovery framework for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that addresses the limitations of static models by incorporating a latent disease pseudotime. By inferring a data-driven pseudotime, the framework orders patients along a disease trajectory and learns how causal relationships between biomarkers evolve, demonstrating superior diagnostic prediction compared to chronological age and revealing dynamic interactions among AD markers.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more accurate and dynamic understanding of Alzheimer's disease progression by modeling evolving causal pathways of biomarkers, rather than static relationships. This improved understanding is crucial for developing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that consider the disease's temporal dynamics.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper applies advanced machine learning/AI techniques (latent variable models for pseudotime inference and causal discovery algorithms) to real-world Alzheimer's disease data. This application aims to enhance the understanding of disease progression, improve diagnostic prediction (e.g., AUC 0.82 for diagnosis prediction), and identify dynamic causal relationships between disease biomarkers (like NfL, GFAP). This constitutes a direct medical AI application for disease modeling, diagnosis, and biomarker analysis.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study applied an existing latent variable model to real-world Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient data. This model was used to infer a latent 'pseudotime' variable, which served to order patients along a data-driven disease trajectory. Subsequently, the framework learned how causal relationships among various AD biomarkers (both novel like NfL and GFAP, and established ones) dynamically evolve across this inferred pseudotime. The methodology also incorporated minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge to enhance the accuracy and orientation of the discovered causal graphs.</p>

                    <p>The inferred pseudotime exhibited significantly superior predictive power for AD diagnosis compared to chronological age, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.82 versus 0.59. The integration of minimal background knowledge substantially improved the accuracy and correct orientation of the learned causal graphs. Crucially, the framework successfully revealed dynamic interactions between novel biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers, providing insights into the evolving pathophysiology of the disease.</p>

                <p>This dynamic causal discovery framework has the potential to significantly improve the understanding of AD pathogenesis and progression, leading to more precise disease staging and prognostication. By identifying how causal relationships between biomarkers change over disease course, it could inform the development of more effective, time-sensitive diagnostic tools and enable the design of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at specific, causally-linked pathological processes at different stages of AD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</p>
