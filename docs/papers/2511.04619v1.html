                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework for dynamic causal discovery in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inferring a latent disease pseudotime, which orders patients along a data-driven disease trajectory independent of chronological age. It overcomes limitations of static causal models by demonstrating how causal relationships evolve over this pseudotime, significantly improving diagnostic prediction compared to age, and revealing dynamic interactions among both novel and established AD biomarkers.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study applies an existing latent variable model to real-world Alzheimer's disease data. This model is utilized to infer a latent 'pseudotime' variable that orders patients along a data-driven disease trajectory, distinct from their chronological age. Subsequently, the framework learns how causal relationships between various disease markers dynamically evolve across this inferred pseudotime. The methodology also incorporates minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge to improve the accuracy and orientation of the inferred causal graphs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</p>
