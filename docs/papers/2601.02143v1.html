                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study utilized an fMRI-derived Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) to examine craving-related brain responses in adolescent experimental smokers versus non-smokers. It found that NCS responses to smoking cues, compared to social rewards, were elevated in experimental smokers and predicted self-reported craving and monthly smoking, with both neural responses and smoking behavior correlating significantly with peer-derived environmental tobacco smoke exposure.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical neurobiological insights into the early stages of tobacco addiction in adolescents, a vulnerable population, by linking brain markers of craving to behavioral outcomes and social environmental factors. This understanding is essential for developing evidence-based prevention and early intervention strategies to combat smoking, a leading cause of preventable mortality.</p>

                <p>The paper identifies and utilizes a 'Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS)' as an fMRI marker. While fMRI data analysis often involves advanced computational methods, including machine learning or AI for pattern recognition or biomarker identification, this abstract does not describe the *development* or *application* of an AI model itself. It's a foundational study using a developed fMRI marker. Therefore, no direct AI health application is presented within the scope of this abstract.</p>

                    <p>This pre-registered study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48).

Levels of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure from both family and peers were also assessed and correlated with NCS responses, self-reported craving, and monthly smoking behavior.</p>

                    <p>Experimental Smokers demonstrated significantly higher NCS responses to smoking cues (compared to social rewards) than Non-smokers. These elevated NCS responses were predictive of individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Furthermore, both smoking behavior and NCS responses were positively correlated with the relative proportion of ETS exposure from peers, rather than from family. These results indicate heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits even during experimental smoking and underscore the significant impact of peer social norms.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Identifying a neurobiological marker (NCS) that predicts craving and smoking behavior early in adolescence could enable targeted screening and early intervention for individuals at high risk of tobacco addiction. The strong correlation with peer ETS exposure suggests that prevention programs focused on modifying peer social norms and reducing peer-related exposure could be particularly effective in preventing smoking initiation and progression in adolescents.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence.</p>
