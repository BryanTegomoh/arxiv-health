                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on an encoder-decoder framework employing self-supervised learning. A robot equipped with a tactile sensor collects sequences of tactile measurements from soft bodies. This process is performed in both a custom simulation environment and a real-world setup, where real soft objects are correlated with MRI ground truth images. The model is trained to predict sensory readings at various object positions, from which a latent representation is learned and subsequently evaluated for tactile imaging and change detection tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.</p>
