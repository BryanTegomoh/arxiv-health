                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aquaculture is pivotal for global food security but faces significant
challenges from infectious diseases, particularly those caused by Streptococcus
species such as Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. These
pathogens induce severe systemic infections in various fish species, resulting
in high morbidity and mortality rates. This review consolidates current
knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of
these infections in fish and provides a comprehensive analysis of multifaceted
control and prebention strategies. Advancements in genetic engineering and
selective breeding are highlighted, demonstrating significant potential in
developing disease-resistant fish strains through technologies like CRISPR-Cas9
and genomic selection. We examine the impact of farming practices on disease
prevalence, emphasizing the roles of stocking density, feeding regimes, and
biosecurity measures. The integration of big data analytics and IoT
technologies is shown to revolutionize disease monitoring and management,
enabling real-time surveillance and predictive modeling for timely
interventions. Progress in vaccine development, including subunit, DNA, and
recombinant protein vaccines, highlights the importance of tailored
immunoprophylactic strategies. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the
One-Health approach and the essential collaboration among industry, academia,
and government to address the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the
environment. This holistic strategy, supported by advanced technologies and
collaborative efforts, promises to enhance the sustainability and productivity
of aquaculture systems. Future research directions advocate for continued
innovation and interdisciplinary partnerships to overcome the persistent
challenges of streptococcal infections in aquaculture.</p>
