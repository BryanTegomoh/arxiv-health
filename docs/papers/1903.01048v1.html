                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a multivariate algorithm utilizing freely available online data (Google search and Wikipedia pageviews) for early detection of influenza outbreaks in the US. It demonstrates that a specific combination of eight such time series can provide significantly earlier warnings than traditional surveillance, predicting seasonal influenza activity an average of 16.4 weeks ahead and recognizing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic five weeks in advance of CDC thresholds.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Public health surveillance systems often fail to detect emerging infectious diseases, particularly in resource limited settings. By integrating relevant clinical and internet-source data, we can close critical gaps in coverage and accelerate outbreak detection. Here, we present a multivariate algorithm that uses freely available online data to provide early warning of emerging influenza epidemics in the US. We evaluated 240 candidate predictors and found that the most predictive combination does \textit{not} include surveillance or electronic health records data, but instead consists of eight Google search and Wikipedia pageview time series reflecting changing levels of interest in influenza-related topics. In cross validation on 2010-2016 data, this algorithm sounds alarms an average of 16.4 weeks prior to influenza activity reaching the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) threshold for declaring the start of the season. In an out-of-sample test on data from the rapidly-emerging fall wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it recognized the threat five weeks in advance of this surveillance threshold. Simpler algorithms, including fixed week-of-the-year triggers, lag the optimized alarms by only a few weeks when detecting seasonal influenza, but fail to provide early warning in the 2009 pandemic scenario. This demonstrates a robust method for designing next generation outbreak detection algorithms. By combining scan statistics with machine learning, it identifies tractable combinations of data sources (from among thousands of candidates) that can provide early warning of emerging infectious disease threats worldwide.</p>
