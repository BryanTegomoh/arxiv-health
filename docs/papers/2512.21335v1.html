                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique for neural network-based computational point-of-care (POC) sensors to mitigate misdiagnosis risks from erroneous predictions. Using a paper-based Lyme disease diagnostic platform (xVFA) as a testbed, the Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based approach successfully identified and excluded uncertain predictions, leading to a significant increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7% during blinded testing, all without requiring ground truth information. This enhances the reliability of rapid, accessible diagnostics.</p>

                    <p>The study incorporated a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into a neural network-driven computational point-of-care system.

MCDO involves performing multiple forward passes through the neural network during inference with dropout layers active to obtain a distribution of predictions, from which uncertainty can be quantified. High-uncertainty predictions were then autonomously identified and excluded from the final diagnostic output.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.</p>
