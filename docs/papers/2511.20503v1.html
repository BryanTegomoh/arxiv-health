                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework for generative modeling by reframing the task as disentangling geometric support from probability distributions using Continuum Percolation. It establishes an isomorphism between Random Geometric Graphs and data manifold topology, proposing a "Percolation Shift metric" and a differentiable loss function to effectively mitigate structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse, ultimately achieving models with enhanced diversity, fidelity, and topological expansion.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Improving generative model robustness against mode collapse and manifold shrinkage is paramount in medicine. This ensures that synthetic medical data (e.g., images, patient records, molecular structures) is diverse, realistic, and representative, leading to safer AI model training, more comprehensive drug discovery, and reliable simulation of biological processes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides foundational improvements to generative AI models. In health, these enhanced models can be applied to generate more realistic and diverse synthetic medical images for training diagnostic AI, create privacy-preserving synthetic patient datasets for research and development, design novel drug candidates by better exploring molecular chemical space, and synthesize biological sequences for bioinformatics studies. By preventing issues like mode collapse and promoting 'Hyper-Generalization,' these models will be more effective at representing the full diversity and complexity of medical data, leading to more robust and reliable AI systems for diagnosis, treatment, and drug development.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>
