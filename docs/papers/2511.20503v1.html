                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework for generative modeling by reframing the task as disentangling geometric support from probability distribution using Continuum Percolation. It proposes a new metric, "Percolation Shift," to robustly evaluate generative models, demonstrating its superiority over FID in detecting structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse, and translates this topological insight into a differentiable loss function to guide training towards "Hyper-Generalization."</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Generative models are crucial in medicine for synthetic data generation (e.g., medical images, rare disease data), drug discovery, and disease modeling. This work enhances the reliability and robustness of these models by providing a superior evaluation metric and a training mechanism that prevents common pitfalls like implicit mode collapse and manifold shrinkage, ensuring generated medical data is diverse, realistic, and representative of the full patient population.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The enhanced generative models developed through this research could lead to more realistic and diverse synthetic medical data (images, patient records, genomic sequences) for training and validating diagnostic/prognostic AI systems. It could also improve the accuracy and diversity of generated molecular compounds in drug discovery, accelerate the development of personalized treatments, and enhance data privacy initiatives by providing high-quality synthetic data that closely mimics real patient data without exposing sensitive information. Improved generative capabilities are also relevant to biosecurity for modeling pathogen evolution or designing countermeasures.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involves establishing an isomorphism between topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and high-dimensional data manifolds. Continuum Percolation theory is applied to analyze geometric support. A novel "Percolation Shift" metric is developed based on this topological understanding.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>
