                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper redefines generative modeling as disentangling geometric support from probability distributions, proposing Continuum Percolation for robust geometric support analysis. It establishes a rigorous isomorphism between topological phase transitions in Random Geometric Graphs and high-dimensional data manifolds. The authors introduce a 'Percolation Shift' metric and a differentiable loss function based on this topological insight, which effectively prevents manifold shrinkage and drives generative models toward 'Hyper-Generalization' with enhanced fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>
