                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing generative models by reframing the task as disentangling geometric support from the probability distribution using Continuum Percolation. It establishes an isomorphism between topological phase transitions in Random Geometric Graphs and high-dimensional data manifolds, introducing a 'Percolation Shift metric' that effectively identifies structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse where statistical metrics fail. By translating this topological insight into a differentiable loss function, the approach prevents manifold shrinkage and drives models towards 'Hyper-Generalization,' achieving high fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>

                    <p>The paper demonstrates that Continuum Percolation offers a powerful tool for analyzing the geometric support of generated data. It establishes a rigorous theoretical link between RGG topological phase transitions and data manifold properties. A significant finding is that the novel Percolation Shift metric can detect subtle structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse, surpassing standard statistical metrics like FID.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>
