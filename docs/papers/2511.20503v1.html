                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper redefines generative modeling as disentangling geometric support from probability distributions, proposing Continuum Percolation for high-dimensional support analysis. It establishes an isomorphism between topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and data manifolds, introducing a 'Percolation Shift' metric that robustly detects structural pathologies like implicit mode collapse where statistical metrics fail. The authors translate this topological insight into a differentiable loss function, demonstrating it prevents manifold shrinkage and achieves 'Hyper-Generalization' with high fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>

                <p>Enhanced generative models could produce more diverse and realistic synthetic medical data for training robust AI diagnostics, improve anomaly detection systems in clinical settings, and aid in drug discovery by generating novel molecular structures.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of "Hyper-Generalization," achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.</p>
