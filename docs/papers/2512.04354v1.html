                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is 'SmartAlert', a machine learning-driven clinical decision support system integrated into the electronic health record (EHR). It utilizes machine learning models to predict stable laboratory results (e.g., CBCs) and provides precision guidance to clinicians to reduce unnecessary repeat testing for hospitalized patients, thereby optimizing lab utilization, reducing costs, and improving patient experience and safety.</p>

                    <p>The study involved implementing SmartAlert, an ML-driven CDS system, into the EHR. It was evaluated through a randomized controlled pilot targeting CBC utilization across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals.

                <p>This system has the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary lab testing, leading to direct cost savings for healthcare systems and patients, decreased patient burden (less blood draws), and improved efficiency in inpatient care. It demonstrates a viable strategy for safely integrating advanced ML tools into routine clinical workflows.</p>

                <p>The abstract describes a "case study" and "randomized controlled pilot" targeting only CBC utilization in specific acute care units. While successful, its generalizability to other lab tests, hospital settings, or broader patient populations would require further investigation. The pilot's duration (August 2024 - March 2025) is also a fixed timeframe.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Repetitive laboratory testing unlikely to yield clinically useful information is a common practice that burdens patients and increases healthcare costs. Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.</p>
