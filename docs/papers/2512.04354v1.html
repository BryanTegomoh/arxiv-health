                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study implemented SmartAlert, an ML-driven CDS system predicting stable lab results, directly into the electronic health record. Its efficacy was evaluated through a randomized controlled pilot study across 9270 admissions in 8 acute care units over 7 months (August 2024 – March 2025). The primary outcome measured was the number of CBC results within a specific timeframe (52 hours) after SmartAlert display in intervention vs. control groups, alongside monitoring secondary safety outcomes. The implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned were also qualitatively documented.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Repetitive laboratory testing unlikely to yield clinically useful information is a common practice that burdens patients and increases healthcare costs. Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.</p>
