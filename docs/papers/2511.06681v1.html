                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a two-stage machine learning framework to address the cost-accuracy dilemma in predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). By selectively acquiring expensive advanced features like PET scans and CSF biomarkers based on their predicted "value of information," the framework reduces the need for such testing by 20%. It achieves a high predictive accuracy (AUROC 0.929) that is comparable to models using all advanced features, making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible and cost-effective.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper introduces an adaptive machine learning triage framework that predicts the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a two-stage machine learning framework. The initial stage uses readily available, less expensive basic clinical and cognitive features to make an initial risk assessment. For patients where the initial assessment is uncertain or the potential gain in predictive power is high, the framework selectively triggers the acquisition of advanced, costly features (e.g., PET scans, CSF biomarker analysis) based on their predicted "value of information." A subsequent machine learning model then incorporates these advanced features for refined prediction. An interpretability component is integrated to explain the rationale behind the triage decisions.</p>

                    <p>The adaptive machine learning framework reduced the need for expensive advanced diagnostic testing by 20%. Despite this reduction, it maintained a high predictive accuracy, achieving a test AUROC of 0.929. This performance was statistically comparable (p=0.1010) to a model that used both basic and all advanced features (AUROC 0.915). The framework also offers an interpretable mechanism for its triage decisions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework offers a significant clinical impact by optimizing diagnostic pathways for Alzheimer's Disease. It can substantially reduce healthcare costs associated with advanced testing while maintaining high predictive accuracy, thereby making early and reliable AD prediction more accessible. This enables clinicians to provide timely, personalized therapy for MCI patients at higher risk of conversion, potentially improving patient management and outcomes in real-world practice by balancing diagnostic efficiency with economic feasibility.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While
cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the
predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are
prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this
cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that
selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted "value
of information". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI
patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while
achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic
and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example
interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our
work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD
diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step
towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world
practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features
and larger-scale validation.</p>
