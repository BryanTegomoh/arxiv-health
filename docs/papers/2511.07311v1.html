                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ACE-ICD, a novel data augmentation technique for automated ICD coding that tackles the underexplored challenge of medical acronyms in clinical notes. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to expand acronyms into their full forms, training models on these richer representations, and incorporates consistency training to regularize predictions between original and augmented documents. The approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MIMIC-III dataset across common, rare, and full-code assignments.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The ACE-ICD method employs a two-stage approach. First, it utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform data augmentation by identifying and expanding medical acronyms within electronic medical records into their full textual forms. This creates an augmented dataset with explicit representations of previously abbreviated terms. Second, it incorporates consistency training during the model's learning phase, which regularizes predictions by enforcing agreement in ICD code assignments between the original clinical documents and their acronym-expanded, augmented counterparts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automatic ICD coding, the task of assigning disease and procedure codes to
electronic medical records, is crucial for clinical documentation and billing.
While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code
hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical
acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this
gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages
large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained
on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency
training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original
and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset
demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art
performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and
full-code assignments. Our code is publicly available.</p>
