                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: Increasing the number of arcs in volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) allows for better intensity modulation and may improve plan
quality. However, this leads to longer delivery times, which may cause patient
discomfort and increase intra-fractional motion. In this study, it was
investigated whether the delivery of different VMAT plans in different
fractions may improve the dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency for the
treatment of patients with complex tumor geometries.
  Materials and Methods: A direct aperture optimization algorithm was developed
which allows for the simultaneous optimization of different VMAT plans to be
delivered in different fractions, based on their cumulative physical dose. Each
VMAT plan is constrained to deliver a uniform dose within the target volume,
such that the entire treatment does not alter the fractionation scheme and is
robust against inter-fractional setup errors. This approach was evaluated
in-silico for ten patients with gynecological and head-and-neck cancer.
  Results: For all patients, fraction-variant treatments achieved better target
coverage and reduced the dose to critical organs-at-risk compared to
fraction-invariant treatments that deliver the same plan in every fraction,
where the dosimetric benefit was shown to increase with the number of different
plans to be delivered. In addition, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments
could approximate the dosimetric quality of 3-arc fraction-invariant
treatments, while reducing the delivery time from 180 s to 60 s and 120 s,
respectively.
  Conclusions: Fraction-variant VMAT treatments may achieve excellent
dosimetric quality for patients with complex tumor geometries, while keeping
the delivery time per fraction viable.</p>
