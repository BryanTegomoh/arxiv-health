                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel "fraction-variant" volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning strategy, where different VMAT plans are delivered across individual treatment fractions. Evaluated in-silico for complex gynecological and head-and-neck cancers, this approach significantly improved dosimetric quality (target coverage, OAR sparing) and reduced treatment delivery times compared to traditional fraction-invariant VMAT. It demonstrates that superior dose distribution can be achieved without increasing the per-fraction delivery time.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes the development of a 'direct aperture optimization algorithm' for simultaneously optimizing different VMAT plans across multiple fractions. This computational optimization approach is a core component of modern medical AI in treatment planning. While not explicitly stated as 'machine learning' or 'deep learning,' advanced optimization algorithms, especially for complex, multi-parameter problems like radiation therapy planning, often fall under the umbrella of computational intelligence or AI applications in medicine, seeking to automate and improve the precision and efficiency of patient-specific treatments.</p>

                    <p>The study involved the development of a direct aperture optimization algorithm designed for the simultaneous optimization of multiple distinct VMAT plans. These plans were intended for delivery in different fractions, with the cumulative physical dose as the optimization objective. A crucial constraint was that each individual VMAT plan delivered a uniform dose within the target volume, ensuring the overall treatment's robustness against inter-fractional setup variations. This novel approach was then evaluated computationally (in-silico) using patient data from ten cases diagnosed with complex gynecological and head-and-neck cancers.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Fraction-variant VMAT treatments consistently resulted in improved target coverage and reduced dose to critical organs-at-risk across all patient cases, outperforming traditional fraction-invariant methods. The dosimetric benefit was directly proportional to the number of distinct plans delivered throughout the treatment course. Notably, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments achieved dosimetric quality comparable to 3-arc fraction-invariant treatments. This high quality was attained with significant reductions in per-fraction delivery time, from 180 seconds (3-arc invariant) to 60 seconds (1-arc variant) and 120 seconds (2-arc variant), respectively.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The implementation of fraction-variant VMAT could lead to more effective and safer radiotherapy treatments for patients with complex tumor geometries. By achieving superior dosimetric quality with shorter per-fraction delivery times, this method could enhance patient comfort, reduce intra-fractional motion artifacts, potentially lower rates of treatment-related toxicities, and improve clinic throughput. This could ultimately translate into better disease control rates and enhanced quality of life for cancer patients.</p>

While promising, the findings require rigorous prospective clinical validation to confirm their real-world efficacy, safety, and robustness in diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The abstract does not specify the exact dosimetric criteria or constraints used for OARs, which could influence the generalizability of the reported dosimetric benefits.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: Increasing the number of arcs in volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) allows for better intensity modulation and may improve plan
quality. However, this leads to longer delivery times, which may cause patient
discomfort and increase intra-fractional motion. In this study, it was
investigated whether the delivery of different VMAT plans in different
fractions may improve the dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency for the
treatment of patients with complex tumor geometries.
  Materials and Methods: A direct aperture optimization algorithm was developed
which allows for the simultaneous optimization of different VMAT plans to be
delivered in different fractions, based on their cumulative physical dose. Each
VMAT plan is constrained to deliver a uniform dose within the target volume,
such that the entire treatment does not alter the fractionation scheme and is
robust against inter-fractional setup errors. This approach was evaluated
in-silico for ten patients with gynecological and head-and-neck cancer.
  Results: For all patients, fraction-variant treatments achieved better target
coverage and reduced the dose to critical organs-at-risk compared to
fraction-invariant treatments that deliver the same plan in every fraction,
where the dosimetric benefit was shown to increase with the number of different
plans to be delivered. In addition, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments
could approximate the dosimetric quality of 3-arc fraction-invariant
treatments, while reducing the delivery time from 180 s to 60 s and 120 s,
respectively.
  Conclusions: Fraction-variant VMAT treatments may achieve excellent
dosimetric quality for patients with complex tumor geometries, while keeping
the delivery time per fraction viable.</p>
