                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel fraction-variant VMAT planning approach where different optimal treatment plans are delivered in different fractions, optimized simultaneously based on their cumulative physical dose. The study demonstrates that this method significantly improves dosimetric quality, achieving better target coverage and reduced organ-at-risk dose for complex gynecological and head-and-neck cancers. Crucially, it achieves this while also reducing per-fraction delivery times compared to conventional fraction-invariant VMAT, addressing patient discomfort and motion concerns.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved the development of a novel direct aperture optimization (DAO) algorithm. This algorithm is designed to simultaneously optimize multiple distinct VMAT plans, each intended for delivery in a different fraction of a patient's overall treatment course. The optimization process is based on the cumulative physical dose delivered over all fractions. A key constraint ensures that each individual VMAT plan delivers a uniform dose within the target volume, thereby maintaining the intended fractionation scheme and enhancing robustness against inter-fractional setup errors. This fraction-variant VMAT approach was then evaluated in-silico using computed tomography data from ten patients diagnosed with complex gynecological and head-and-neck cancers.</p>

                    <p>Fraction-variant VMAT treatments consistently achieved superior dosimetric quality across all evaluated patients, demonstrating improved target coverage and reduced dose to critical organs-at-risk when compared to conventional fraction-invariant treatments. The study found that the dosimetric benefit increased with the number of different plans delivered across fractions. Furthermore, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments were able to approximate the high dosimetric quality typically achieved by 3-arc fraction-invariant treatments, while significantly reducing the per-fraction delivery time from 180 seconds (for 3-arc fraction-invariant) to 60 seconds and 120 seconds, respectively.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has significant potential to improve clinical radiation therapy by allowing for highly conformal and precise dose delivery to complex tumors, such as those found in gynecological and head-and-neck regions, while simultaneously shortening the treatment duration per fraction. Shorter treatment times can directly enhance patient comfort, reduce intra-fractional motion artifacts, and potentially increase the throughput capacity of radiotherapy clinics, leading to more efficient and safer treatment delivery.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation explicitly stated within the abstract is that the evaluation of this novel approach was conducted "in-silico." This implies that the findings are based on computational simulations and require prospective clinical validation in a real-world setting to confirm their efficacy and safety in patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: Increasing the number of arcs in volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) allows for better intensity modulation and may improve plan
quality. However, this leads to longer delivery times, which may cause patient
discomfort and increase intra-fractional motion. In this study, it was
investigated whether the delivery of different VMAT plans in different
fractions may improve the dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency for the
treatment of patients with complex tumor geometries.
  Materials and Methods: A direct aperture optimization algorithm was developed
which allows for the simultaneous optimization of different VMAT plans to be
delivered in different fractions, based on their cumulative physical dose. Each
VMAT plan is constrained to deliver a uniform dose within the target volume,
such that the entire treatment does not alter the fractionation scheme and is
robust against inter-fractional setup errors. This approach was evaluated
in-silico for ten patients with gynecological and head-and-neck cancer.
  Results: For all patients, fraction-variant treatments achieved better target
coverage and reduced the dose to critical organs-at-risk compared to
fraction-invariant treatments that deliver the same plan in every fraction,
where the dosimetric benefit was shown to increase with the number of different
plans to be delivered. In addition, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments
could approximate the dosimetric quality of 3-arc fraction-invariant
treatments, while reducing the delivery time from 180 s to 60 s and 120 s,
respectively.
  Conclusions: Fraction-variant VMAT treatments may achieve excellent
dosimetric quality for patients with complex tumor geometries, while keeping
the delivery time per fraction viable.</p>
