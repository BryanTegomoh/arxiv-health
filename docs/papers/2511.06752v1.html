                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Med-SORA is a novel framework designed for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CT images, aiming to overcome limitations of existing medical multimodal models that rely on simplistic one-to-one labeling and only 2D image features. It introduces RAG-based dataset construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors for complex symptom-organ relationships, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global anatomical information. Experimental results indicate Med-SORA's superior performance over existing models in enabling accurate 3D clinical reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to clinical practice by developing an AI model that can accurately connect patient symptoms to specific anatomical organs in medical images, reflecting the complex pathophysiology often seen in real-world scenarios. It promises to improve diagnostic precision and efficiency, particularly in the abdomen where symptoms can be ambiguous and related to multiple structures.</p>

                <p>Med-SORA has the potential to substantially impact clinical diagnosis by providing a more precise and context-aware tool for interpreting abdominal CT scans based on patient symptoms. This could lead to quicker and more accurate identification of affected organs, narrowing down differential diagnoses, and ultimately guiding more effective treatment plans. It offers a step towards more intelligent and interpretable AI assistants for radiologists and clinicians, particularly in complex cases where symptom-image correlation is challenging.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding symptom-image associations is crucial for clinical reasoning.
However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one
hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to
multiple organs. In addition, they mainly use single-slice 2D features without
incorporating 3D information, limiting their ability to capture full anatomical
context. In this study, we propose Med-SORA, a framework for symptom-to-organ
reasoning in abdominal CT images. Med-SORA introduces RAG-based dataset
construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to capture one-to-many
symptom-organ relationships, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse
local and global image features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning. Experimental
results show that Med-SORA outperforms existing medical multimodal models and
enables accurate 3D clinical reasoning.</p>
