                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research identifies a universal 'Acoustic Emission (AE) cascade' phenomenon preceding failure in quasi-brittle materials like rock and bone, demonstrating its potential for real-time failure prediction. The study shows that this cascade, arising from a specific power-law coupling, provides a critical 30-70 second warning for impending skull fracture in simulated neurosurgical contexts. This predictive capability could significantly enhance patient safety by allowing for timely remedial action.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research offers a breakthrough in patient safety by providing a method to predict imminent bone failure, specifically skull fracture, during invasive medical procedures. The 30-70 second warning window allows clinicians to intervene and potentially prevent severe cranial injuries during neurosurgical head immobilization.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The described 'cascade' providing 'warning of impending failure' and 'accurate prediction of failure time' is a prime candidate for AI/machine learning applications. An AI system could be trained to recognize these acoustic emission patterns in real-time during surgical procedures, providing automated alerts to surgeons, potentially integrated into smart surgical devices or patient monitoring systems. This would serve as a predictive analytics tool to prevent iatrogenic injury related to bone failure.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed experimental investigations on two quasi-brittle materials under fixed loading: granite beams subjected to three-point bending, and human cadaver skulls loaded with pinning forces mimicking neurosurgical immobilization. Acoustic Emission (AE) event rates were continuously monitored for both materials as failure progressed. The observed AE data were then analyzed against a rate-dependent material failure law, specifically focusing on the detection and characterization of a quasi-linear cascade in the inverse AE energy rate.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the identification of a consistent 'quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate' that reliably precedes failure in both rock and human bone under fixed loading. This cascade is theoretically underpinned by a specific power-law coupling between response rate and a driver, which is itself a power law of accumulated response. Crucially, this phenomenon provides a predictive warning: for granite, it accurately predicted failure over the final 30% of specimen life; for human skulls, it offered a 30-70 second warning of impending fracture, a timeframe considered sufficient for clinical intervention.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The potential clinical impact is significant, primarily for neurosurgical procedures requiring head immobilization. Real-time Acoustic Emission monitoring could be integrated into surgical equipment to provide an early warning (30-70 seconds) of impending skull fracture, enabling surgeons to take immediate remedial actions such as reducing pin loads or repositioning, thereby preventing severe patient injury, including intracranial damage. This could lead to a new standard in intraoperative patient safety monitoring.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations could include the use of cadaveric material, which may not perfectly reflect in-vivo bone properties or physiological responses. The practical challenges of implementing AE monitoring in a sterile surgical environment and differentiating relevant AE signals from surgical noise are also not discussed. The generalizability of the exact warning timeframe (30-70 seconds) to all skull regions or patient populations also remains to be fully explored.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state future research directions. However, logical next steps could involve the development and clinical validation of real-time AE monitoring systems for neurosurgical applications, investigating the AE cascade in a wider range of bone types and loading conditions relevant to orthopedics, and exploring the influence of patient-specific factors (e.g., age, bone density, pathology) on the predictive accuracy of the cascade. Further refinement of the underlying theoretical model and exploration of non-invasive AE sensing methods could also be areas for future work.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Quasi brittle materials such as rock and bone are understood to fail via
microcrack coalescence. The accompanying Acoustic Emission (AE) event rate is
known to increase as failure progresses. Here we examine the progression of the
AE event rate for both rock and bone under conditions where failure progresses
under fixed loading. The experiments for rock entail subjecting granite beams
to a fixed loading under three point bending and monitoring the time-dependent
failure. For bone, human cadaver skulls are loaded under pinning loads similar
to those used for immobilization of the head for neurosurgical procedures. AE
rates are shown to be consistent with a rate dependent material failure law
including a quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate in the lead up
to failure that is shown here to arise because of a coupling wherein a response
rate is a power law of a driver and the driver is, in turn, a power law of the
accumulated response. For both materials and experimental configurations this
cascade provides warning of impending failure. For granite beams there is
accurate prediction of failure time over the final 30 percent of the specimens
lifetimes, which ranged from 35 seconds to two days. For skull fracture, the
commencement of the failure cascade provides 30-70 seconds for warning of
failure, which would be sufficient for basic remedial action to avoid patient
injury in a surgical application.</p>
