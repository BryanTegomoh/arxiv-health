                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper identifies an "Acoustic Emission (AE) cascade" as a reliable predictor of impending failure in quasi-brittle materials like rock and bone. By monitoring the inverse AE energy rate, the study demonstrates that this cascade provides a crucial warning period before material fracture, with significant implications for preventing patient injury in medical settings.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research offers a novel method to predict bone failure, specifically skull fracture, during medical procedures such as neurosurgical head immobilization. The predictive warning could enable timely intervention, significantly enhancing patient safety and preventing severe complications.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The identified Acoustic Emission (AE) cascade provides a predictive warning of impending bone failure. This mechanism is highly suitable for the development of a real-time medical AI application. An AI system (e.g., using machine learning or deep learning) could be trained on AE data to continuously monitor stress on bone (e.g., during skull pinning in neurosurgery), detect the characteristic cascade pattern, and issue automated, timely alerts to surgical staff. This would enable proactive intervention to prevent catastrophic bone fracture and patient injury during surgical procedures.</p>

This cascade is linked to a specific rate-dependent material failure law and serves as a robust predictor of impending failure, offering a 30-70 second warning for skull fracture.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Quasi brittle materials such as rock and bone are understood to fail via
microcrack coalescence. The accompanying Acoustic Emission (AE) event rate is
known to increase as failure progresses. Here we examine the progression of the
AE event rate for both rock and bone under conditions where failure progresses
under fixed loading. The experiments for rock entail subjecting granite beams
to a fixed loading under three point bending and monitoring the time-dependent
failure. For bone, human cadaver skulls are loaded under pinning loads similar
to those used for immobilization of the head for neurosurgical procedures. AE
rates are shown to be consistent with a rate dependent material failure law
including a quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate in the lead up
to failure that is shown here to arise because of a coupling wherein a response
rate is a power law of a driver and the driver is, in turn, a power law of the
accumulated response. For both materials and experimental configurations this
cascade provides warning of impending failure. For granite beams there is
accurate prediction of failure time over the final 30 percent of the specimens
lifetimes, which ranged from 35 seconds to two days. For skull fracture, the
commencement of the failure cascade provides 30-70 seconds for warning of
failure, which would be sufficient for basic remedial action to avoid patient
injury in a surgical application.</p>
