                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research investigates the progression of Acoustic Emission (AE) event rates in quasi-brittle materials, specifically rock and bone, under fixed loading conditions leading to failure. The study identifies a predictable "quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate" preceding failure, consistent with a rate-dependent material failure law. This AE cascade provides a critical warning of impending failure for both materials, offering a significant window for intervention in medical applications.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a crucial mechanism for predicting impending bone failure, particularly skull fracture, during medical procedures requiring head immobilization. The identified 30-70 second warning period for skull fracture could enable surgeons to take timely remedial action, significantly enhancing patient safety and preventing injury.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a predictive phenomenon ('acoustic emission cascade') that provides a warning of impending bone failure. This is a classic application for AI/machine learning. An AI model could be trained on acoustic emission data to detect these cascades in real-time during surgical procedures or when monitoring patients, providing automated, early warnings of potential fracture or material failure in bone structures or fixation devices, thus enabling timely intervention to prevent patient injury.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed experimental setups to monitor Acoustic Emission (AE) event rates during the progression to failure under fixed loading. Granite beams were tested using a three-point bending configuration. Human cadaver skulls were subjected to pinning loads designed to mimic those used for head immobilization in neurosurgical procedures. The observed AE data were then analyzed against a rate-dependent material failure law involving power law relationships to describe the cascade behavior.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the consistent observation of a "quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate" that reliably precedes material failure in both granite and human cadaver skulls. This cascade is theoretically explained by a specific coupling wherein the material's response rate follows a power law of a driving force, and this driving force, in turn, follows a power law of the accumulated material response. Critically, this cascade serves as an accurate and robust predictor of impending failure, providing a significant warning period.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The potential clinical impact is substantial, particularly in neurosurgery. The ability to predict skull fracture 30-70 seconds in advance, as demonstrated by the AE cascade, offers a critical window for intervention. This would allow surgeons to proactively adjust pinning loads or take other remedial actions to prevent skull damage and associated patient injury during procedures requiring rigid head fixation, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Quasi brittle materials such as rock and bone are understood to fail via
microcrack coalescence. The accompanying Acoustic Emission (AE) event rate is
known to increase as failure progresses. Here we examine the progression of the
AE event rate for both rock and bone under conditions where failure progresses
under fixed loading. The experiments for rock entail subjecting granite beams
to a fixed loading under three point bending and monitoring the time-dependent
failure. For bone, human cadaver skulls are loaded under pinning loads similar
to those used for immobilization of the head for neurosurgical procedures. AE
rates are shown to be consistent with a rate dependent material failure law
including a quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate in the lead up
to failure that is shown here to arise because of a coupling wherein a response
rate is a power law of a driver and the driver is, in turn, a power law of the
accumulated response. For both materials and experimental configurations this
cascade provides warning of impending failure. For granite beams there is
accurate prediction of failure time over the final 30 percent of the specimens
lifetimes, which ranged from 35 seconds to two days. For skull fracture, the
commencement of the failure cascade provides 30-70 seconds for warning of
failure, which would be sufficient for basic remedial action to avoid patient
injury in a surgical application.</p>
