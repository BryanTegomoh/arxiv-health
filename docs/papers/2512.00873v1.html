                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DeepPriorCBCT, a three-stage deep learning framework designed to achieve diagnostic-grade CBCT reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. The framework was extensively validated using a large-scale multicenter retrospective dataset of 4102 patients and further confirmed its clinical applicability in a prospective cross-over trial with 138 patients, demonstrating comparable image quality and diagnostic performance to standard methods while significantly reducing radiation exposure.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it addresses a critical patient safety concern by drastically reducing radiation exposure during CBCT-guided interventions, such as thoracic puncture, for cancer diagnosis and treatment.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a three-stage deep learning framework named DeepPriorCBCT. It involved a retrospective analysis of 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers for development and validation. Additionally, a prospective cross-over clinical trial (NCT07035977) recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture to assess clinical applicability. Image quality and diagnostic performance were evaluated by 11 physicians (retrospective), and independently by 5 radiologists and 25 interventionalists (prospective trial) comparing DeepPriorCBCT reconstructions with standard methods.</p>

                    <p>DeepPriorCBCT enabled diagnostic-grade CBCT reconstruction at approximately one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. Retrospectively, 11 physicians found reconstructed images indistinguishable from original scans, with comparable diagnostic performance and overall image quality. Prospectively, 5 radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment (all P>0.05), and 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>DeepPriorCBCT has the potential to significantly improve patient safety in CBCT-guided procedures by substantially reducing intraoperative radiation exposure without compromising image quality or clinical decision-making. This could lead to a lower incidence of radiation-induced secondary malignancies, particularly for patients requiring repeated scans, and could be broadly adopted in interventional oncology settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided puncture has become an established approach for diagnosing and treating early- to mid-stage thoracic tumours, yet the associated radiation exposure substantially elevates the risk of secondary malignancies. Although multiple low-dose CBCT strategies have been introduced, none have undergone validation using large-scale multicenter retrospective datasets, and prospective clinical evaluation remains lacking. Here, we propose DeepPriorCBCT - a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers were included to develop and validate DeepPriorCBCT. Additionally, a prospective cross-over trial (Registry number: NCT07035977) which recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture was conducted to assess the model's clinical applicability. Assessment by 11 physicians confirmed that reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans. Moreover, diagnostic performance and overall image quality were comparable to those generated by standard reconstruction algorithms. In the prospective trial, five radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment between DeepPriorCBCT and the clinical standard (all P>0.05). Likewise, 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure with DeepPriorCBCT was reduced to approximately one-sixth of that with the conventional approach, and collectively, the findings confirm that it enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk.</p>
