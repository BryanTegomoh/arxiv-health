                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Delta-XAI, a unified framework that adapts 14 existing XAI methods for explaining prediction changes in online time series monitoring, addressing the oversight of temporal dependencies in prior work. It also proposes a principled evaluation suite and a novel method, Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING). Key findings include that adapted classical gradient-based methods like Integrated Gradients can outperform recent XAI approaches, and SWING consistently demonstrates superior effectiveness by systematically capturing temporal dependencies.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as it directly addresses the critical need for interpretable AI models in healthcare for online time series monitoring, such as patient vital signs or continuous glucose monitoring, where understanding *why* a prediction changes is crucial for timely and accurate clinical decision-making, patient safety, and building trust in AI systems.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research directly contributes to enhancing the explainability (XAI) of AI models used for online time series monitoring in healthcare. For instance, in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or for remote patient monitoring, an AI system might continuously monitor vital signs (time series data) and predict a patient's deteriorating condition. Delta-XAI and SWING would allow clinicians to understand *why* the AI's prediction changed, identifying specific temporal patterns or features that led to the change, thus providing critical insights for medical intervention. This improves trust, accountability, and the interpretability of AI-driven clinical decision support systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Explaining online time series monitoring models is crucial across sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where temporal and contextual prediction dynamics underpin critical decisions. While recent XAI methods have improved the explainability of time series models, they mostly analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies. This results in further challenges: explaining prediction changes is non-trivial, methods fail to leverage online dynamics, and evaluation remains difficult. To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SWING across diverse settings with respect to diverse metrics.
