                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel two-part framework to systematically model both explicit and implicit clinical uncertainty found in radiology reports, addressing limitations of current automated analysis methods. It quantifies explicit uncertainty using an LLM-based, expert-validated ranking of hedging phrases and models implicit uncertainty by expanding reports with characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways. The work culminates in the release of Lunguage++, an enriched, uncertainty-aware benchmark dataset designed to enable improved image classification and faithful diagnostic reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.</p>
