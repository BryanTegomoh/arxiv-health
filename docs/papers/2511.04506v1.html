                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework to model and quantify clinical uncertainty in radiology reports, categorizing it into explicit (hedging phrases) and implicit (omitted reasoning) types. It leverages a combination of expert validation, large language models (LLMs), and expert-defined diagnostic pathways to address these challenges, resulting in the creation of Lunguage++, an uncertainty-aware benchmark for structured radiology reports. This resource aims to improve automated analysis, image classification, and diagnostic reasoning by incorporating a nuanced understanding of uncertainty.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) and custom frameworks to quantify explicit and model implicit uncertainty in radiology reports. This enables the creation of an 'uncertainty-aware' resource (Lunguage++) that supports improved medical image classification, more faithful diagnostic reasoning by AI systems, and a better understanding of the clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty, thereby enhancing automated analysis for clinical decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.</p>
