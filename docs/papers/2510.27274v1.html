                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TraceDR, a novel drug recommendation (DR) system built upon medical knowledge graphs (MKGs), designed to address the critical lack of traceability in existing deep learning-based DR systems. By employing a multi-task learning framework, TraceDR simultaneously predicts medication recommendations and provides explicit evidence for these suggestions, thereby ensuring the derivation process is transparent and explainable. The authors also contribute a new large-scale testbed, DrugRec, for DR, created through an automatic patient health record construction framework, to support more diverse disease and drug scenarios.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>TraceDR is a novel drug recommendation system built upon a medical knowledge graph (MKG). It employs a multi-task learning framework to concurrently predict drug recommendations and associated explanatory evidence. A key component is the automatic construction framework for patient health records, which facilitates the creation of a new, large-scale dataset named DrugRec for evaluation and training.</p>

                    <p>The abstract primarily describes the proposed system's capabilities and contributions rather than explicit results. The main 'findings' are that TraceDR successfully enables traceable drug recommendations by integrating MKGs and multi-task learning for simultaneous prediction of recommendations and supporting evidence. Furthermore, the creation of the DrugRec testbed addresses the need for more diverse and larger-scale datasets in drug recommendation research.</p>

                <p>By providing transparent and evidence-backed drug recommendations, TraceDR can significantly enhance the trust and adoption of AI-powered clinical decision support systems. This transparency allows clinicians to validate recommendations against medical knowledge, potentially leading to safer prescribing practices, reduced medication errors, and more personalized and effective patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Drug recommendation (DR) systems aim to support healthcare professionals in
selecting appropriate medications based on patients' medical conditions.
State-of-the-art approaches utilize deep learning techniques for improving DR,
but fall short in providing any insights on the derivation process of
recommendations -- a critical limitation in such high-stake applications. We
propose TraceDR, a novel DR system operating over a medical knowledge graph
(MKG), which ensures access to large-scale and high-quality information.
TraceDR simultaneously predicts drug recommendations and related evidence
within a multi-task learning framework, enabling traceability of medication
recommendations. For covering a more diverse set of diseases and drugs than
existing works, we devise a framework for automatically constructing patient
health records and release DrugRec, a new large-scale testbed for DR.</p>
