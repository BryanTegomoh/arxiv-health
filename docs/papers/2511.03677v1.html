                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study employs periodic ordinary differential equation models to investigate how different antibiotic resistance mechanisms (plasmid-induced vs. mutation-induced) impact treatment outcomes and optimal dosing strategies. It reveals that fixed dosing is more effective against plasmid-mediated resistance, while mutation-driven resistance favors the selection of fully resistant strains upon treatment failure. The research also identifies superior dosing regimens, showing twice-daily regimens outperform once-daily for infection clearance, and a "catch-up" strategy is best for missed doses of short half-life antibiotics.</p>

                <p>The findings suggest that clinical decisions regarding antibiotic dosing schedules could be tailored based on the suspected or known resistance mechanism of the pathogen, potentially improving treatment success. The research supports the adoption of more frequent dosing (e.g., twice-daily) for certain antibiotics to enhance infection clearance. Furthermore, it offers evidence-based guidance for patient education on managing missed doses of short half-life antibiotics, advocating for a 'catch-up' strategy to maintain therapeutic levels and mitigate resistance development, thus directly informing pharmacy and clinical practice.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms, with
the specific mechanism depending on the drug-bacteria pair. It remains unclear,
however, which resistance mechanism best supports favorable treatment outcomes,
specifically in clearing infections and inhibiting further resistance. In this
study, we use periodic ordinary differential equation models to simulate
different antibiotic treatment protocols for bacterial infections. Using
stability analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how different
resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-induced and mutation-induced
resistance, affect treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic
treatments with fixed dosing schedules are more likely to be effective when
resistance arises exclusively through plasmid-mediated transmission. Further,
when treatment fails, mutation-driven mechanisms tend to favor the selection of
fully resistant bacterial strains. We also investigated the efficacy of
different treatment strategies based on these mechanisms, finding that a
twice-daily regimen consistently outperforms a once-daily regimen in terms of
infection clearance. Additionally, our simulations with short half-life
antibiotics indicate that the "catch-up" strategy outperforms the "compensatory
double-dose" approach after a missed dose, a finding that aligns with general
pharmaceutical advice for short-half-life drugs.</p>
