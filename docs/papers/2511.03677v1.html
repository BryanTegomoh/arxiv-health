                <p class="abstract">Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms, with
the specific mechanism depending on the drug-bacteria pair. It remains unclear,
however, which resistance mechanism best supports favorable treatment outcomes,
specifically in clearing infections and inhibiting further resistance. In this
study, we use periodic ordinary differential equation models to simulate
different antibiotic treatment protocols for bacterial infections. Using
stability analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how different
resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-induced and mutation-induced
resistance, affect treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic
treatments with fixed dosing schedules are more likely to be effective when
resistance arises exclusively through plasmid-mediated transmission. Further,
when treatment fails, mutation-driven mechanisms tend to favor the selection of
fully resistant bacterial strains. We also investigated the efficacy of
different treatment strategies based on these mechanisms, finding that a
twice-daily regimen consistently outperforms a once-daily regimen in terms of
infection clearance. Additionally, our simulations with short half-life
antibiotics indicate that the "catch-up" strategy outperforms the "compensatory
double-dose" approach after a missed dose, a finding that aligns with general
pharmaceutical advice for short-half-life drugs.</p>
