                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MolBridge is a novel atom-level joint graph refinement framework designed to predict drug-drug interaction (DDI) events with high accuracy and robustness. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by explicitly modeling atom-level cross-molecular interactions within a joint graph and utilizing a structure consistency module to overcome over-smoothing challenges. This approach leads to superior performance across diverse molecular complexities, including long-tail and inductive scenarios, offering enhanced mechanistic interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.</p>
