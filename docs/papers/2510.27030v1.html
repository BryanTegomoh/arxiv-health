                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper extends the F-matrix framework, previously established for isochronous ranked phylogenetic tree shapes, to fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. It establishes an explicit bijection between a new class of F-matrices and these heterochronous tree shapes, offering a method for straightforward enumeration and the development of probabilistic models for evolutionary processes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate modeling and analysis of fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes are critical for understanding medical evolutionary processes, such as tracking B cell affinity maturation in the immune system, which has direct implications for vaccine development, disease progression, and pathogen evolution.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper focuses on developing a combinatorial and probabilistic mathematical framework for representing and analyzing tree shapes. While the insights and models developed could serve as foundational components or be incorporated into larger AI/machine learning systems for analyzing medical or health-related biological data (e.g., for phylogenetic inference, immune repertoire analysis, or epidemiological modeling), the paper itself does not describe a direct AI application in health. It is primarily a theoretical and methodological contribution to quantitative biology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We
consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the
internal nodes compatible the tree graph. Recent work has established an
elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called
\textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for
isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time,
such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals.
Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of
events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree,
called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods.
These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B
cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a
fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total
order.
  Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous
ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of
\textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix
representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly
constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of
all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic
models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial
objects that have a rich history in the literature: isochronous ranked tree
shapes are related to alternating permutations that Andr\'e studied over 130
years ago, and Poupard found (nearly 40 years ago) that fully heterochronous
ranked tree shapes are counted by the reduced tangent numbers.</p>
