                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper generalizes the **F**-matrix framework, previously applied to isochronous ranked phylogenetic tree shapes, to fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes, where leaves can have diverse sampling times. It establishes an explicit bijection between a specific class of **F**-matrices and these heterochronous tree shapes, offering a structured method for their enumeration and the development of probabilistic models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This generalization is crucial for analyzing phylogenetic data where sampling times vary (e.g., longitudinal studies or sequenced pathogens), enabling a more accurate understanding of dynamic biological processes like B cell affinity maturation in the immune system or the evolution of pathogens within a host.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The mathematical framework developed (matrix representation, enumeration, probabilistic models for tree shapes) could serve as a foundational computational tool for AI/ML applications in health. For instance, AI algorithms could leverage this framework to analyze phylogenetic patterns of immune cells (like B cells) to predict immune responses, identify markers for disease susceptibility or progression, track the evolution of pathogens for targeted interventions, or inform vaccine design by modeling immune repertoire dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We
consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the
internal nodes compatible the tree graph. Recent work has established an
elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called
\textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for
isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time,
such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals.
Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of
events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree,
called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods.
These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B
cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a
fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total
order.
  Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous
ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of
\textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix
representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly
constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of
all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic
models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial
objects that have a rich history in the literature: isochronous ranked tree
shapes are related to alternating permutations that Andr\'e studied over 130
years ago, and Poupard found (nearly 40 years ago) that fully heterochronous
ranked tree shapes are counted by the reduced tangent numbers.</p>
