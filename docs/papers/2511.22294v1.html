                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core method involves Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework. MVMAE processes multiple image views from a radiology study (e.g., AP/PA and lateral chest X-rays) by applying masking to portions of the images. It then learns to reconstruct the masked regions while simultaneously enforcing alignment between the representations learned from different views. This cross-view alignment serves as a self-supervisory signal, promoting the learning of view-invariant features. The MVMAE-V2T extension incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal during pretraining to enrich the semantic understanding of the visual features. Crucially, text is used only for pretraining, ensuring that downstream inference remains purely vision-based.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>MVMAE consistently achieved superior performance compared to both fully supervised baselines and existing vision-language models in downstream disease classification across MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest datasets. MVMAE-V2T further enhanced these results, demonstrating significant gains, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data (low-label regimes). This indicates that integrating structural multi-view information and textual reports leads to more robust and semantically grounded representations.</p>

                <p>This work has a substantial potential clinical impact by enabling the creation of more accurate, robust, and generalizable AI models for radiology diagnostics. By efficiently utilizing readily available multi-view data and radiology reports, it can drastically reduce the reliance on costly manual annotations, accelerating the development and deployment of AI tools in clinical settings. The improved performance, particularly in data-scarce environments, suggests these models could be more effectively applied to rare diseases or settings with limited resources, ultimately enhancing diagnostic consistency and patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.</p>
