                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the limitations of conventional single-intent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in handling complex scientific questions that require evidence from multiple intents and multi-hop reasoning. It introduces the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark to evaluate heterogeneous evidence coverage and proposes an intent-aware retrieval framework. This framework leverages LLMs to decompose questions into intent-specific queries, retrieves diverse supporting passages, and aggregates them using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to achieve superior retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed intent-aware retrieval framework employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to first hypothesize potential answers to complex scientific questions. These hypothetical answers are then decomposed into multiple, fine-grained, intent-specific queries. For each of these sub-queries, the system retrieves supporting passages from a knowledge base. Finally, all the retrieved fragments are aggregated and re-ranked using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to ensure a balanced and non-redundant coverage of evidence across all identified intents, which then serves as context for answer generation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.</p>
