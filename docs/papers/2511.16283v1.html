                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MuISQA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems on complex scientific questions that entail multiple intents and require heterogeneous evidence. To address the limitations of conventional single-intent RAG systems, the authors propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose questions into intent-specific queries. The framework retrieves supporting evidence for each intent, aggregates, and re-ranks it using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), demonstrating superior performance in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage compared to conventional approaches.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.</p>
