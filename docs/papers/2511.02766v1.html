                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This review synthesizes current understanding of how the gut microbiota fundamentally regulates sleep physiology via the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA), influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. It highlights how microbial dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering key neurotransmitter and metabolic pathways (e.g., serotonin, GABA, SCFAs), with significant implications for neurodegenerative, metabolic, and mood disorders, and explores microbiota-targeted interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep
physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the
gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system
modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic
homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to
sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent
findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by
altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with
implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood
disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and
immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation
mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and
the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted
therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and
chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and
improve health outcomes</p>
