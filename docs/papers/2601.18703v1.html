                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper advances infectious disease modeling by introducing chemotaxis-inspired Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models, which more realistically capture airborne infection spread towards susceptible populations compared to traditional reaction-diffusion models. It provides an epidemiologically interpretable framework, including a novel spatially-aware basic reproduction number ($R_0$), and demonstrates improved accuracy in simulating spatiotemporal disease dynamics in real-world scenarios like the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The development of these enhanced predictive models can significantly impact clinical and public health strategies. Policymakers can leverage more accurate spatiotemporal forecasts to implement targeted interventions (e.g., localized lockdowns, contact tracing, resource deployment like hospital beds or vaccines) in specific areas at critical times. A spatially-aware $R_0$ allows for more precise risk assessments, potentially leading to earlier and more effective clinical responses, thus mitigating disease spread and reducing morbidity and mortality.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the presented model. However, inherent limitations might include: the simplification of complex human mobility into a chemotaxis term; computational demands for solving complex PDEs with high spatial resolution; reliance on the availability and accuracy of detailed geospatial demographic and epidemiological data; and the generalizability of the model across all types of airborne diseases or socio-geographic contexts without further calibration and validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious diseases, while less common than their ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts, have found successful applications for many years. Such models are typically of reaction-diffusion type, and model spatial propagation as a diffusive process. However, given the complex nature of human mobility, such models are limited in their ability to describe airborne infectious diseases in human populations. Recent work has advocated for the inclusion of an additional chemotaxis-type term as an alternative; spatial propagation of infection fronts is assumed additionally to flow from low-to-high concentrations of susceptible populations. The present work extends the study of such models by providing an epidemiologically interpretable analysis, directly connecting model behavior to information readily available to policymakers. In particular, we derive a spatially-aware basic reproduction number, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density. Furthermore, we discuss several important aspects concerning the numerical solution of the model, including the introduction of a stabilization scheme. Finally, we perform a series of simulation studies in the Italian region of Lombardy (severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020) and in the US state of Georgia, in which we demonstrate the model's potential to better capture important spatiotemporal dynamics observed in real-world data compared to pure reaction-diffusion models.</p>
