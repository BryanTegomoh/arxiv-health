                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>TauFlow has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by enabling rapid, accurate, and localized medical image segmentation on portable or low-power edge devices. This can facilitate faster diagnostic insights, aid real-time decision-making during surgeries or interventional procedures (e.g., using portable ultrasound), and expand the accessibility of advanced AI-powered diagnostics to remote clinics or emergency settings. Ultimately, it could lead to more efficient patient care and improved outcomes through ubiquitous access to intelligent imaging analysis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deploying lightweight medical image segmentation models on edge devices
presents two major challenges: 1) efficiently handling the stark contrast
between lesion boundaries and background regions, and 2) the sharp drop in
accuracy that occurs when pursuing extremely lightweight designs (e.g., <0.5M
parameters). To address these problems, this paper proposes TauFlow, a novel
lightweight segmentation model. The core of TauFlow is a dynamic feature
response strategy inspired by brain-like mechanisms. This is achieved through
two key innovations: the Convolutional Long-Time Constant Cell (ConvLTC), which
dynamically regulates the feature update rate to "slowly" process low-frequency
backgrounds and "quickly" respond to high-frequency boundaries; and the STDP
Self-Organizing Module, which significantly mitigates feature conflicts between
the encoder and decoder, reducing the conflict rate from approximately 35%-40%
to 8%-10%.</p>
