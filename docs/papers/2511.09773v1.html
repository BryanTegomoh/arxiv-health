                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">NeuroLingua introduces a novel language-inspired hierarchical framework for automated sleep stage classification, addressing current limitations in expressive temporal hierarchies, multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and deep learning model interpretability. By conceptualizing sleep as a structured physiological language and employing dual-level Transformers with Graph Convolutional Network-based fusion, it achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. This framework not only improves classification accuracy but also enhances the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, paving the way for more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.</p>

                    <p>NeuroLingua uses a CNN-based tokenizer to convert 30-second sleep epochs into 3-second overlapping subwindow "tokens."

Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.</p>
