                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations) introduces a novel weakly supervised framework for refining anatomical segmentations, addressing the limitations of existing methods that require extensive user interaction or dense annotations. It leverages 'light feedback' in the form of region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels to significantly improve initial automated predictions. Demonstrated on humerus CT scans, SCORE achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods while drastically reducing supervision requirements and annotation time.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SCORE is a weakly supervised deep learning framework. Its central methodological innovation lies in its novel loss function, designed to learn from 'light feedback' rather than dense pixel-level annotations. This feedback comprises two types of regional evaluations: region-wise quality scores (e.g., indicating the overall quality of a segmented region) and specific labels for over-segmentation or under-segmentation errors within a region. By optimizing this loss, SCORE trains a model to correct and refine initial mask predictions generated by existing automated segmentation tools (e.g., foundation models like TotalSegmentator). The training process effectively guides the model to minimize these regional errors, leading to improved segmentation accuracy.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that SCORE considerably improves the accuracy of initial automated segmentations, specifically demonstrated on humerus CT scans, where it refined predictions from TotalSegmentator. Crucially, SCORE achieved this enhanced performance at a level comparable to existing segmentation refinement methods that typically demand significantly more supervision (e.g., dense ground truth masks or extensive user interactions). The study highlights the framework's capability to deliver high-quality refinement while drastically reducing the resource burden in terms of training data annotation time and expert involvement.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>SCORE holds significant clinical impact by making high-quality anatomical segmentation more accessible and less labor-intensive. It can accelerate the integration of AI-powered segmentation tools into routine clinical practice by mitigating the need for extensive manual correction or costly dense annotations for training. This could lead to faster and more consistent reporting, improved pre-surgical planning, and more reliable quantitative analysis in various diagnostic and interventional procedures, particularly benefiting departments with limited resources or expertise for manual annotation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis.
Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to
variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently,
a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across
diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the
clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can
improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or
require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE
(Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised
framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback
during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image
annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality
scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on
humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from
TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement
methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation
time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.</p>
