                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SCORE is a weakly supervised deep learning framework designed for segmentation refinement. Instead of relying on dense, pixel-level ground truth annotations for training, it utilizes a novel loss function incorporating 'light feedback' signals. These signals include region-wise quality scores and binary labels indicating over-segmentation or under-segmentation errors. The framework was evaluated by refining initial humerus segmentations generated by the TotalSegmentator model on CT scans.</p>

                    <p>SCORE considerably improves the accuracy of initial automated segmentations, as demonstrated on humerus CT scans using TotalSegmentator predictions. It achieves a level of refinement performance comparable to existing methods, while critically reducing their supervision requirements and annotation time. This validates its effectiveness in enhancing segmentation quality with greater resource efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact lies in enabling more accurate and efficient anatomical segmentation for medical professionals. By providing a method to refine automated segmentations with minimal expert input, SCORE can significantly reduce the manual workload for radiologists and clinicians. This could lead to faster turnaround times for image analysis, more precise diagnosis, improved surgical planning, and a higher standard of care, especially in scenarios where manual segmentation is prohibitively time-consuming.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis.
Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to
variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently,
a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across
diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the
clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can
improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or
require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE
(Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised
framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback
during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image
annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality
scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on
humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from
TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement
methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation
time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.</p>
