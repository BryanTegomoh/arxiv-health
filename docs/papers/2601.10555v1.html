                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The `causalfe` package provides a Python implementation of Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE), designed to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects robustly in panel data settings. It addresses the common challenge of spurious heterogeneity caused by unit and time fixed effects in standard causal forest methods by employing node-level residualization during tree construction. The paper details the methodology, software interface, and validates its performance through simulation studies across various data generating processes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant for medicine as it enables robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in longitudinal patient data, such as electronic health records or clinical trials, controlling for unobserved patient-level and time-specific confounding factors. This capability is crucial for developing personalized treatment strategies and understanding differential treatment responses in real-world clinical settings, improving the precision of medical interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This package provides a machine learning (Causal Forests) method for robust causal inference, specifically tailored for heterogeneous treatment effects. In a health AI context, this could be used to: 1) Develop AI models that predict individual patient responses to specific treatments, informing precision medicine. 2) Evaluate the differential impact of health interventions or policies across patient subgroups using real-world data. 3) Optimize treatment strategies based on a deeper understanding of varying causal effects. As a Python implementation, it provides a practical tool for data scientists and researchers applying AI/ML techniques to medical and health datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper introduces the Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE) approach, implemented in the `causalfe` Python package. The core methodology involves performing node-level residualization during the construction of the causal forest trees. This means that within each candidate split for tree growth, unit-specific and time-specific fixed effects are estimated and removed from the outcome and treatment variables. This localized residualization prevents these fixed effects from spuriously driving heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates, a problem common in standard causal forests when applied to panel data. The performance is validated via extensive simulation studies.</p>

                    <p>The simulation studies conducted validate the CFFE estimator's performance across various data generating processes. This indicates that the method successfully and robustly estimates heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data while effectively controlling for unit and time fixed effects, thereby overcoming the limitations faced by standard causal forest implementations in such contexts.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This method can significantly enhance personalized medicine by allowing clinicians and researchers to more accurately identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from specific treatments, or conversely, those who might experience adverse effects or no benefit. It facilitates more precise risk stratification, optimizes treatment allocation, and refines individualized patient care pathways in longitudinal settings, moving towards a more data-driven and evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The causalfe package provides a Python implementation of Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE) for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data settings. Standard causal forest methods struggle with panel data because unit and time fixed effects induce spurious heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates. The CFFE approach addresses this by performing node-level residualization during tree construction, removing fixed effects within each candidate split rather than globally. This paper describes the methodology, documents the software interface, and demonstrates the package through simulation studies that validate the estimator's performance under various data generating processes.</p>
