                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The causalfe package introduces a Python implementation of Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE) to accurately estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data settings. This method addresses the challenge of unit and time fixed effects, which typically induce spurious heterogeneity in standard causal forest estimates, by performing node-level residualization during tree construction. Through simulation studies, the package demonstrates validated performance, offering a robust tool for causal inference in longitudinal settings relevant to precision medicine and health research.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is crucial for precision medicine and real-world evidence generation in healthcare, allowing researchers to accurately identify patient subgroups who respond differently to treatments in longitudinal studies (e.g., EHR data, observational cohorts). By correctly accounting for stable patient characteristics and time-varying confounders, it enables more precise and reliable estimations of treatment efficacy and safety for diverse patient populations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This package provides a machine learning tool for robust causal inference, enabling the identification of subgroups that respond differently to treatments or interventions. This is a core capability for developing AI-driven precision medicine strategies and decision support systems aimed at personalizing patient care. It can be used to inform treatment recommendations, optimize resource allocation, and evaluate the impact of health policies based on individual or group characteristics.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper describes Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE), an ensemble machine learning method that builds multiple causal trees specifically adapted for panel data. The core innovation lies in 'node-level residualization,' where unit-specific and time-specific fixed effects are removed within each candidate split of a decision tree. This ensures that splits identifying treatment effect heterogeneity are driven by true patient-level or time-level variation rather than confounding fixed effects. The methodology is implemented in the Python package `causalfe` and validated through extensive simulation studies that test its performance under various data generating processes.</p>

                    <p>The `causalfe` package successfully implements Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE), which is demonstrated to accurately estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data. The key to its success is the novel node-level residualization technique, which effectively addresses the confounding influence of unit and time fixed effects. Simulation studies confirm the estimator's robust performance and validity across different data generating processes, showcasing its ability to prevent spurious heterogeneity.</p>

                <p>This method can significantly improve clinical decision-making by providing more reliable estimates of personalized treatment effects, helping clinicians identify which patients are most likely to benefit from specific interventions, or conversely, who might experience adverse effects. It supports the development of precision medicine strategies, enables robust evaluation of public health policies or medical guidelines using longitudinal real-world data, and aids in identifying subgroups for targeted interventions or further study, ultimately leading to more effective and safer patient care.</p>
