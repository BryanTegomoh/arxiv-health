                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper demonstrates a generic mechanism to prevent stochastic extinction in finite excitable systems. It shows that in inhomogeneous settings, a vulnerable subsystem diffusively coupled to an adjacent stable patch can be reanimated and stabilized through continuous immigration flux from the interface, provided the absorbing region sustains spreading activity fronts. This process effectively eliminates finite-size extinction instabilities, ensuring population persistence.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides fundamental insights into how biological populations, such as pathogens, immune cells, or beneficial microbes, can persist within a host despite intrinsic stochastic fluctuations. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for developing strategies to manage chronic infections, bolster immune system resilience, or maintain the stability of critical microbiomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper provides foundational insights into complex system dynamics relevant to health. While not an AI paper itself, its findings could inform the development of AI models for: 1) Predicting epidemic spread and persistence based on spatial connectivity and population movements. 2) Identifying vulnerable populations or regions susceptible to disease extinction/re-emergence. 3) Optimizing public health interventions by understanding how 'stable patches' (e.g., highly vaccinated populations) can protect or reanimate 'vulnerable subsystems' (e.g., unvaccinated pockets) against disease outbreaks. AI could be used to simulate these complex models, analyze large-scale epidemiological data to find such patterns, or develop predictive analytics for disease control.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs theoretical and computational modeling to analyze various dynamical systems. It investigates inhomogeneous settings where a vulnerable subsystem is diffusively coupled to a stable region, focusing on how 'spreading activity fronts' generate continuous 'immigration flux' to prevent extinction. This is applied to established models like predator-prey, epidemic spreading, and cyclic competition to demonstrate the generic nature of the stabilization mechanism.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that invading activity fronts, originating from a stable subsystem and propagating into an adjacent vulnerable region, can generate a continuous immigration flux. This flux acts as a 'reanimation' mechanism, effectively stabilizing the vulnerable subsystem and generically eliminating the finite-size extinction instabilities that would otherwise lead to the demise of the population due to stochastic fluctuations.</p>

                <p>This work could inform novel clinical strategies for maintaining beneficial microbial populations (e.g., gut microbiome following antibiotic treatment), enhancing the persistence of therapeutic immune responses (e.g., CAR-T cells in cancer immunotherapy), or understanding the long-term survival of pathogens despite host defenses. It suggests that establishing 'stable reservoirs' or 'source populations' and facilitating their spatial spread could be a powerful tool for population stabilization in biological systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Stochastic chemical reaction or population dynamics in finite systems often terminates in an absorbing state. Yet in large spatially extended systems, the time to reach species extinction (or fixation) becomes exceedingly long. Tuning control parameters may diminish the survival probability, rendering species coexistence susceptible to stochastic extinction events. In inhomogeneous settings, where a vulnerable subsystem is diffusively coupled to an adjacent stable patch, the former is reanimated through continuous influx from the interfaces, provided the absorbing region sustains spreading activity fronts. We demonstrate this generic elimination of finite-size extinction instabilities via immigration flux in predator-prey, epidemic spreading, and cyclic competition models.</p>
