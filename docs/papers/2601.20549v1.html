                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study comprehensively assessed the significant variability in quantitative Lutetium-177 (177Lu) measurements using radionuclide calibrators (RNCs) and SPECT/CT systems across multiple clinical centers. It revealed RNC measurement differences up to 11% and SPECT quantification variability up to 58%, concluding that current practices lack standardization crucial for accurate dosimetry in 177Lu-based therapies. The research strongly advocates for harmonized calibration and reconstruction protocols to improve multicenter reproducibility.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a multicenter phantom-based experimental design. Two types of phantoms—a uniform cylindrical phantom and a NEMA phantom with hot spheres—were prepared with traceable 177Lu activities. These phantoms were imaged at 8 different hospitals using 13 distinct SPECT/CT systems (comprising 9 conventional systems and 4 3D Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) systems). Both site-specific clinical protocols and standardized acquisition/reconstruction protocols were utilized. Image Calibration Factors (ICFs) were derived from cylindrical phantom images, and Recovery Coefficients (RCs) from NEMA images to assess quantitative SPECT accuracy and image quality. Concurrently, the accuracy of radionuclide calibrators was tested by measuring two 177Lu vials across centers.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Radionuclide calibrator measurements exhibited up to 11% difference between participating centers. Quantitative 177Lu SPECT/CT imaging showed substantial variability, with differences reaching up to 20% for the uniform cylindrical phantom and a notable 58% for the NEMA phantom (hot spheres) when using site-specific clinical protocols. While Image Calibration Factors (ICFs) were found to be consistent for SPECT/CT systems of the same type, image quality and overall quantification varied significantly. Standardized reconstruction protocols effectively reduced variability for each specific SPECT/CT system type, irrespective of the acquisition protocol. However, considerable differences in quantification and image quality persisted between different SPECT/CT system types (e.g., conventional vs. 3D CZT) even after harmonizing both acquisition and reconstruction protocols.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings underscore a critical need for standardization in 177Lu measurement practices. The observed high variability directly impacts the reliability of quantitative dosimetry for 177Lu-based radioligand therapies, potentially leading to inaccurate dose delivery and hindering the optimization of patient treatment. Implementing standardized calibration and reconstruction protocols would significantly improve the accuracy, reproducibility, and comparability of quantitative 177Lu SPECT/CT data across institutions, which is essential for robust multicenter clinical trials, personalized dosimetry, and ultimately, safer and more effective patient care.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study's primary limitation is the reliance on phantom measurements rather than *in vivo* patient data, which may not fully replicate all complexities of clinical imaging, such as patient motion, attenuation variations, and organ specific uptake. Additionally, despite harmonization efforts, persistent differences between distinct SPECT/CT system types (conventional vs. 3D CZT) suggest that a universal, one-size-fits-all standardization approach might still face technological challenges.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research and clinical efforts should prioritize the development and rigorous implementation of globally harmonized and standardized calibration and reconstruction protocols for quantitative 177Lu-SPECT/CT. This includes addressing the remaining differences between various SPECT/CT system technologies to achieve consistent quantitative results across all platforms. Further studies could also explore the impact of these variabilities on patient dosimetry in real-world clinical scenarios and the development of robust quality control programs to monitor and maintain standardization over time.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: Following the clinical success of 177Lu-based therapies for neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, accurate quantification of 177Lu using radionuclide calibrators (RNCs) and 177Lu-SPECT/CT is gaining importance as prerequisite for accurate treatment delivery and dosimetry. However, the lack of standardization can introduce inter-system variability, compromising multi-center clinical trials. This study aimed to assess the accuracy and variability of 177Lu measurements using RNCs and SPECT/CT across different systems and hospitals. Methods: A uniform cylindrical phantom and a NEMA phantom with hot spheres were prepared using traceable activities and imaged at 8 different hospitals using 13 SPECT/CT systems (9 conventional and 4 3D CZT). Acquisitions and reconstructions were performed using both site-specific and standardized protocols. The cylindrical phantom images were used to establish image calibration factors (ICFs), the NEMA images to evaluate image quality by calculating recovery coefficients (RCs). Both were used to evaluate quantitative SPECT accuracy. In parallel, two vials were measured to test RNC accuracy. Results: RNC measurements differed up to 11% between centers, while SPECT quantification differed up to 20% and 58% for the cylindrical and NEMA phantoms respectively. While ICFs were consistent for systems of the same type, image quality varied strongly when using clinical protocols. Standardized reconstruction reduced variability for each system type, regardless of acquisition protocol, but differences between system types persisted when harmonizing acquisition and reconstruction. Conclusion: Current 177Lu measurement practices yield significant variability in quantification and image quality. Harmonization efforts should prioritize standardized calibration and reconstruction protocols to improve multicenter reproducibility of quantitative 177Lu-SPECT/CT.</p>
