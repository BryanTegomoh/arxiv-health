                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The RepAir framework employs a sequential, three-stage approach. First, an nnU-Net-based deep learning network performs an initial segmentation to generate a 3D airway mask. Second, a skeleton-based algorithm processes this mask to detect and localize disconnected segments, subsequently proposing potential reconnections between them. Third, a 1D convolutional classifier then evaluates each proposed reconnection, classifying it as either a true anatomical airway branch or an erroneous connection/obstructed path, thereby correcting the topology.</p>

It demonstrated improvements in both voxel-level segmentation accuracy and, critically, topological metrics, resulting in significantly more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.</p>
