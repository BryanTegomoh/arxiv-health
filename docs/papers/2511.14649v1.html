                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">RepAir is a novel three-stage framework designed for robust 3D airway segmentation from CT scans, specifically addressing the common issue of disconnected components produced by conventional U-Net-based methods. It combines an nnU-Net for initial segmentation with an anatomically informed topology correction pipeline that uses skeletonization and a 1D convolutional classifier to identify and reconnect true airway branches. Evaluated on datasets spanning healthy to severe pathological airways, RepAir significantly outperforms existing approaches, yielding more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees with high accuracy.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>RepAir employs a three-stage pipeline. First, an nnU-Net-based segmentation network generates an initial 3D airway mask from CT scans. Second, a skeleton-based algorithm analyzes this mask to identify potential discontinuities and propose candidate reconnections between disconnected airway segments. Third, a 1D convolutional classifier evaluates these proposed links, classifying them as either true anatomical branches or false/obstructed paths to reconstruct a topologically correct airway tree.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.</p>
