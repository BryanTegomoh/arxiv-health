                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This retrospective multi-model study evaluated 11 different forecasting models using U.S. COVID-19 wastewater surveillance data from March 2022 to September 2024 across national and regional levels. It identified that n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles excelled at 3-4-week forecasting horizons, particularly nationally and in the Midwest and West, while ARIMA and GAM performed best for shorter 1-2-week forecasts. The research highlights the critical need for region-specific modeling strategies to optimize public health responses during pandemics.</p>

                    <p>The study performed a retrospective multi-model analysis using sequential weekly COVID-19 wastewater surveillance data obtained from the CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS). Data covered the United States, nationally and across four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), from March 2022 through September 2024. A total of 133 weekly forecasts were generated using 11 distinct models, including ARIMA, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Prophet, and variants of the n-sub-epidemic framework. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Weighted Interval Score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage for various forecast horizons.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensemble models proved most effective for longer-term (3-4-week) COVID-19 forecasts, showing superior performance at the national level and specifically in the Midwest and West regions. For shorter-term (1-2-week) forecasts, ARIMA and GAM models performed optimally across most U.S. regions. Conversely, Prophet and Simple Linear Regression (SLR) consistently demonstrated poor forecasting accuracy across all regions and horizons tested. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring forecasting model selection to the specific forecast horizon and geographic context.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate and reliable forecasting models are critical for guiding public health responses and policy decisions during pandemics such as COVID-19. Retrospective evaluation of model performance is essential for improving epidemic forecasting capabilities. In this study, we used COVID-19 wastewater data from CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System to generate sequential weekly retrospective forecasts for the United States from March 2022 through September 2024, both at the national level and for four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We produced 133 weekly forecasts using 11 models, including ARIMA, generalized additive models (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Prophet, and the n-sub-epidemic framework (top-ranked, weighted-ensemble, and unweighted-ensemble variants). Forecast performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), weighted interval score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles outperformed all other models at 3-4-week horizons, particularly at the national level and in the Midwest and West. ARIMA and GAM performed best at 1-2-week horizons in most regions, whereas Prophet and SLR consistently underperformed across regions and horizons. These findings highlight the value of region-specific modeling strategies and demonstrate the utility of the n-sub-epidemic framework for real-time outbreak forecasting using wastewater surveillance data.</p>
