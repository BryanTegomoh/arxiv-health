                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the reliability of AI-driven medication recommendations by leveraging multi-LLM collaboration guided by a framework called "LLM Chemistry." By quantifying collaborative compatibility among LLMs, this method aims to create ensembles that are effective, stable, and calibrated, thereby overcoming issues of hallucination and inconsistency often found in individual LLMs or naive ensembles. Preliminary results suggest this interaction-aware collaboration can generate credible and patient-specific medication recommendations from brief clinical vignettes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As healthcare increasingly turns to AI for scalable and trustworthy clinical decision support, ensuring reliability in model reasoning remains a critical challenge. Individual large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistency, whereas naive ensembles of models often fail to deliver stable and credible recommendations. Building on our previous work on LLM Chemistry, which quantifies the collaborative compatibility among LLMs, we apply this framework to improve the reliability in medication recommendation from brief clinical vignettes. Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations. Preliminary results are encouraging, suggesting that LLM Chemistry-guided collaboration may offer a promising path toward reliable and trustworthy AI assistants in clinical practice.</p>
