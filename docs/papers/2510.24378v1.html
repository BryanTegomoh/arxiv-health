                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces StrokeSeg, a modular, lightweight, and deployment-ready software framework designed to translate high-performing deep learning stroke lesion segmentation models, typically challenging to integrate clinically, into practical applications. By decoupling preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing, and leveraging ONNX Runtime with Float16 quantization, StrokeSeg reduces model size by 50% while maintaining equivalent segmentation performance to original PyTorch pipelines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.</p>
