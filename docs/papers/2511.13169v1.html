                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved developing TCM-5CEval, an extended multi-dimensional benchmark for LLM evaluation in TCM. This benchmark comprises five distinct categories: TCM-Exam (Core Knowledge), TCM-LitQA (Classical Literacy), TCM-MRCD (Clinical Decision-making), TCM-CMM (Chinese Materia Medica), and TCM-ClinNPT (Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy). Fifteen prominent LLMs were then subjected to a thorough evaluation using this benchmark. A critical aspect of the methodology was the implementation of permutation-based consistency testing to assess the robustness and stability of model inference by varying the ordering of question options.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Significant performance disparities were observed among the fifteen evaluated LLMs in TCM-related tasks, with deepseek_r1 and gemini_2_5_pro showing superior performance. While models exhibited competence in recalling foundational TCM knowledge, they consistently struggled with the interpretive complexities inherent in classical TCM texts. A critical discovery was the pervasive inference fragility across all models: permutation-based consistency testing revealed a substantial performance degradation when question option ordering was varied, indicating a widespread sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust, stable understanding of the underlying concepts.</p>

            </div>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings critically highlight that current LLMs, even top-performing ones, are not yet sufficiently robust or reliable for sensitive clinical applications in Traditional Chinese Medicine due to their observed inference fragility and susceptibility to positional bias. This instability could lead to inconsistent or erroneous clinical decision-making, potentially jeopardizing patient safety and treatment efficacy. TCM-5CEval provides a crucial diagnostic tool to identify and address these fundamental weaknesses, guiding the development of more stable, unbiased, and clinically trustworthy AI models essential for future integration into TCM practice.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study identifies critical limitations in the evaluated LLMs themselves, rather than the benchmark. Specifically, it reveals that all models, even the highest-scoring ones, exhibit widespread fragilities in their inference mechanisms and a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias in question option ordering. This indicates a fundamental lack of robust and stable understanding when processing TCM clinical data.</p>

                <p>The release of TCM-5CEval on the Medbench platform is intended to foster further research and standardize comparisons of LLM capabilities in TCM. Future work should focus on developing LLM architectures and training paradigms that specifically address and mitigate issues of positional bias and inference fragility, aiming to achieve more stable, robust, and clinically reliable reasoning in specialized medical domains.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in general domains, yet their application in highly specialized and culturally-rich fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) requires rigorous and nuanced evaluation. Building upon prior foundational work such as TCM-3CEval, which highlighted systemic knowledge gaps and the importance of cultural-contextual alignment, we introduce TCM-5CEval, a more granular and comprehensive benchmark. TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\_r1 and gemini\_2\_5\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability. To promote further research and standardized comparison, TCM-5CEval has been uploaded to the Medbench platform, joining its predecessor in the "In-depth Challenge for Comprehensive TCM Abilities" special track.</p>
