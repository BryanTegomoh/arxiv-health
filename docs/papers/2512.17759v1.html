                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed machine learning models to predict pathologic complete response (PCR) and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), utilizing longitudinal contrast-enhanced MRI and clinical data. The research demonstrated that an image registration-based approach significantly enhanced feature extraction from MRI, and that radiomic features, particularly with logistic regression, outperformed deep learning-based features for these prognostic predictions.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a comprehensive framework involving processing longitudinal contrast-enhanced MRI and clinical data. Key steps included tumour segmentation, followed by image registration to align images at different time points for precise tracking of intratumoral changes. Four feature extraction methods were compared: a traditional radiomics approach and three deep learning models (MedicalNet, Segformer3D, SAM-Med3D). These extracted features were then subjected to three feature selection methods and subsequently used to train four different machine learning models for binary classification of PCR and RFS. Model performance was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and classification accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers a promising non-invasive prognostic tool that could enable clinicians to more accurately predict breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and their 5-year relapse-free survival. Such predictions could inform individualized treatment plans, potentially guiding decisions on surgical de-escalation for strong responders, or prompting alternative, more aggressive therapies for those predicted to have a poor response, thus optimizing patient care and reducing treatment-related morbidities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Aim: This study investigates treatment response prediction to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer patients, using longitudinal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (CE-MRI) and clinical data. The goal is to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict pathologic complete response (PCR binary classification) and 5-year relapse-free survival status (RFS binary classification). Method: The proposed framework includes tumour segmentation, image registration, feature extraction, and predictive modelling. Using the image registration method, MRI image features can be extracted and compared from the original tumour site at different time points, therefore monitoring the intratumor changes during NACT process. Four feature extractors, including one radiomics and three deep learning-based (MedicalNet, Segformer3D, SAM-Med3D) were implemented and compared. In combination with three feature selection methods and four ML models, predictive models are built and compared. Results: The proposed image registration-based feature extraction consistently improves the predictive models. In the PCR and RFS classification tasks logistic regression model trained on radiomic features performed the best with an AUC of 0.88 and classification accuracy of 0.85 for PCR classification, and AUC of 0.78 and classification accuracy of 0.72 for RFS classification. Conclusions: It is evidenced that the image registration method has significantly improved performance in longitudinal feature learning in predicting PCR and RFS. The radiomics feature extractor is more effective than the pre-trained deep learning feature extractors, with higher performance and better interpretability.</p>
