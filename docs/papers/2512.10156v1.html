                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Batched Ordinary Least Squares (BOLS) test statistic to address challenges in causal inference for adaptive experiments, which are increasingly adopted across various fields, including medicine. The BOLS statistic offers a precision-equalizing aggregation of per-period treatment-control differences, effectively handling heteroskedasticity. It enables the construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals for treatment effects and has been validated through simulations comparing rejection rates in common experimental settings.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The statistical methods for inference in batched adaptive experiments are crucial for the development and validation of AI applications in healthcare. For instance, AI algorithms can guide adaptive clinical trials to optimize treatment arms or dose selection. Similarly, AI-driven personalized medicine strategies could be evaluated and refined using adaptive experimental designs that leverage these inference methods. The methodology is also applicable for A/B testing and evaluating the causal impact of AI-powered digital health interventions.</p>

                    <p>The authors developed a novel statistical test statistic, BOLS (batched ordinary least squares), which performs a precision-equalizing aggregation of per-period treatment-control differences. This aggregation is achieved by computing a normalized average of heteroskedastic per-period z-statistics.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The advantages of adaptive experiments have led to their rapid adoption in economics, other fields, as well as among practitioners. However, adaptive experiments pose challenges for causal inference. This note suggests a BOLS (batched ordinary least squares) test statistic for inference of treatment effects in adaptive experiments. The statistic provides a precision-equalizing aggregation of per-period treatment-control differences under heteroskedasticity. The combined test statistic is a normalized average of heteroskedastic per-period z-statistics and can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We provide simulation results comparing rejection rates in the typical case with few treatment periods and few (or many) observations per batch.</p>
