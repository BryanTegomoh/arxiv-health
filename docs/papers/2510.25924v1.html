                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenge of estimating causal effects in multi-domain settings where a key confounder is unobserved, but a proxy variable for it is available. It proposes a novel methodology to identify and estimate these causal effects in a target domain, even when the causal effect itself changes across domains and only the proxy is observed. The work provides theoretical proofs for identifiability and introduces two consistent estimation techniques with derived confidence intervals, supported by simulations and a real-world application.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant to medicine by enabling more robust estimation of treatment effects despite pervasive unobserved confounding (e.g., genetic predispositions, unmeasured lifestyle factors, sub-clinical conditions) and variability across patient populations or clinical settings, using accessible proxy measures like biomarkers or surrogate endpoints.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides foundational causal inference methodology critical for medical AI applications. It can be used to: 1) Infer robust treatment effects from observational patient data, accounting for unobserved confounders using available proxies (e.g., biomarkers, lifestyle factors). 2) Enhance personalized medicine by estimating individual causal effects across different patient populations or conditions (multi-domain) where some confounders are unobserved. 3) Improve drug safety and effectiveness studies by disentangling causal relationships from confounded real-world evidence. 4) Evaluate the causal impact of public health interventions or policies with incomplete confounder information.</p>

                    <p>The paper employs theoretical causal inference frameworks to prove the identifiability of causal effects under unobserved confounding conditions, given a proxy variable. It then develops two distinct statistical estimation techniques, rigorously proving their consistency and deriving methods for constructing confidence intervals. The proposed methods are validated through computational simulations and applied to a real-world dataset to demonstrate practical utility.</p>

                <p>This research can lead to more accurate and reliable assessments of treatment efficacy and safety across diverse patient groups, particularly when comprehensive confounder data is unavailable. It could significantly improve the generalizability of research findings across different clinical settings or populations, thereby facilitating more informed and data-driven clinical decision-making and personalized medicine strategies.</p>

While identifiability is proven for continuous treatment and response, the abstract does not explicitly detail the scope and applicability of the *estimation techniques* themselves for continuous variables, potentially implying their primary focus might be on discrete/categorical variables or requiring further adaptation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.</p>
