                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenging problem of estimating a causal effect in multi-domain settings where the true confounder is unobserved and the causal effect may vary across domains. It proposes a novel methodology that leverages a proxy variable of the hidden confounder to achieve identifiability and consistent estimation of the causal effect in a target domain, even when only the proxy is observable there.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This methodology is highly relevant for medicine and health research by enabling robust causal inference in complex real-world settings where key confounders are often unmeasured, and studies span diverse patient populations or clinical environments, potentially leading to varied treatment effects.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This methodology can be applied to develop more sophisticated and reliable AI systems in medicine. For instance, it could be used to: 1) Estimate the causal effect of a new drug or treatment on patient outcomes, even when relevant patient characteristics are unobserved and trial results need to be generalized to different patient populations. 2) Evaluate the true impact of public health interventions or policies across various regions or demographics by accounting for unmeasured confounding factors. 3) Build AI models that provide more accurate and generalizable predictions of disease risk or treatment response by properly adjusting for unobserved confounders and adapting to different healthcare data sources.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology involves utilizing a proxy variable for an unobserved confounder to estimate a causal effect in a multi-domain setting.

These techniques are proven consistent, and methods for deriving confidence intervals are also provided.</p>

                <p>This research could significantly enhance the reliability of evidence-based medicine by providing tools to derive more accurate causal claims from observational data, even when ideal conditions (e.g., randomized control trials) are not feasible or when transferring findings across different patient cohorts or healthcare systems. It could enable better drug efficacy assessments, risk factor identification, and treatment guideline development by accounting for unmeasured biases and heterogeneous treatment effects.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the identifiability proof extends to continuous treatment and response, the proposed estimation techniques are specified for discrete or categorical variables, potentially limiting direct application to continuous medical outcomes or interventions without further methodological extensions. The methodology's effectiveness is inherently dependent on the quality and validity of the chosen proxy variable, which can be challenging to ascertain in real-world medical contexts. The abstract does not explicitly state other limitations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.</p>
