                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel mathematical model for epidemic spread that challenges conventional immunity assumptions, proposing that recovered individuals only gain immunity if continuously infected for a period, otherwise reverting to susceptibility. Utilizing field theory, the model identifies distinct 'pandemic' and 'response' phases and accurately describes the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, suggesting only 30% of recovered agents developed immunity.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This model offers a critical re-evaluation of immunity mechanisms in infectious disease epidemiology, particularly relevant for novel pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 where post-infection immunity is uncertain, thus providing a refined theoretical basis for public health interventions and pandemic preparedness strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study develops a novel mathematical model incorporating a specific conditional immunity mechanism: individuals only develop immunity if continuously infected for a certain duration; otherwise, they revert to a susceptible state after recovery. This model's dynamics are subsequently analyzed using principles derived from field theory, which helps bound the infectious rate and characterize distinct phases of disease spread.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a theoretical framework that could significantly inform public health strategies for managing infectious diseases with uncertain immunity, like COVID-19. Understanding the 'response regime' allows policymakers to implement targeted disease control measures to prevent surges ('second waves') and optimize resource allocation. The model's insights can guide decisions on non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccination strategies, and balancing public health protection with economic and societal functioning, leading to more resilient pandemic responses.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests a novel type of disease spread dynamics. WHO states that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are immune from a second infection [WHO]. Conventional mathematical models consider cases for which a recovered individual either becomes susceptible again or develops an immunity. Here, we study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become susceptible again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious rate. Consequently, the theory's phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes the epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. We find that only 30% of the recovered agents have developed an immunity. We anticipate our paper to influence the decision making upon balancing the economic impact and the pandemic impact on society. As long as disease controlling measures keep the disease dynamics in the "response regime", a pandemic escalation ('second wave') is ruled out.</p>
