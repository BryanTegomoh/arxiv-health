                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel epidemiological model addressing diseases like SARS-CoV-2, where immunity post-recovery is not guaranteed but contingent on sustained infection. Utilizing field theory, the model defines distinct disease dynamics phases and accurately describes the Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak, suggesting only 30% of recovered individuals developed immunity. The findings offer a framework for public health decision-making to prevent pandemic escalation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to public health policy and infectious disease management, especially for novel pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 where immunity dynamics are uncertain. It provides a theoretical framework to predict disease progression, inform intervention strategies, and ultimately prevent uncontrolled outbreaks and subsequent waves.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper's methodology uses 'field theory' from physics and is a mathematical model rather than an AI model itself, the type of computational modeling and prediction of disease dynamics it performs is fundamental to many AI applications in public health. Specifically, such models serve as inputs or foundational components for AI-driven predictive analytics for outbreaks, resource allocation optimization, and developing decision-support systems for public health interventions and policy making.</p>

                    <li>Field theory is applied to this model, which establishes an upper bound for the peak of the infectious rate, providing a theoretical constraint on disease spread.</li>
                    
                    <li>The model identifies two distinct phases of disease dynamics: a 'pandemic phase' characterized by widespread, uncontrolled transmission, and a 'response regime' where the disease is manageable.</li>
                    
                    <li>The model demonstrates an excellent fit to the real-world epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a novel mathematical modeling approach that extends conventional SIR/SIRS models by introducing a conditional immunity mechanism, where immunity is acquired only upon prolonged infection. It then applies theoretical physics methods, specifically field theory, to analyze the dynamics and derive bounds on key epidemiological parameters. The model's validity is tested by fitting it to real-world SARS-CoV-2 outbreak data from Wuhan, China.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Key findings include the demonstration that field theory bounds the peak infectious rate in this new model. The model characterizes disease dynamics into a 'pandemic phase' and a 'response regime'. Crucially, it accurately describes the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, estimating that only 30% of recovered individuals developed immunity. This suggests that maintaining the 'response regime' through interventions can effectively prevent 'second waves'.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This model has significant potential to inform public health strategies and clinical decision-making during novel epidemics by providing a more realistic understanding of immunity dynamics. It offers a theoretical basis for maintaining disease control and preventing large-scale outbreaks or 'second waves' through sustained, targeted interventions, thereby enabling a more informed balance between public health imperatives and economic considerations.</p>

Future directions would likely involve applying this model to other geographical regions and outbreaks, refining its parameters with broader datasets, and potentially integrating additional factors such as vaccine efficacy or socio-behavioral responses.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests a novel type of disease spread dynamics. WHO states that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are immune from a second infection [WHO]. Conventional mathematical models consider cases for which a recovered individual either becomes susceptible again or develops an immunity. Here, we study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become susceptible again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious rate. Consequently, the theory's phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes the epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. We find that only 30% of the recovered agents have developed an immunity. We anticipate our paper to influence the decision making upon balancing the economic impact and the pandemic impact on society. As long as disease controlling measures keep the disease dynamics in the "response regime", a pandemic escalation ('second wave') is ruled out.</p>
