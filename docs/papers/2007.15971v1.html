                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel epidemiological model that challenges conventional assumptions about post-infection immunity, proposing that individuals only develop lasting immunity if continuously infected for a specific duration, otherwise reverting to susceptibility. Utilizing field theory, the model identifies distinct pandemic and response regimes, accurately describing the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan and estimating only 30% of recovered individuals developed immunity. The research aims to provide a framework for balancing economic and pandemic impacts through informed decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This model offers a critical new perspective for understanding infectious diseases like COVID-19 where immunity may not be complete or long-lasting, providing a more realistic framework for public health planning, resource allocation, and the design of intervention strategies, especially in the context of emerging pathogens with uncertain immunodynamics.</p>

                <p>Not applicable, as this paper presents a mathematical model of disease dynamics using field theory, not an AI application itself. However, the theoretical framework and insights derived from this model could be used to inform or validate AI models for epidemic forecasting, public health policy optimization, or resource allocation during future pandemics.</p>

                    <li>The model deviates from traditional SIR-type models by positing that immunity after recovery is not guaranteed but conditional on being continuously infected for a certain period; otherwise, individuals become susceptible again.</li>
                    
                    <li>Field theory is employed as the mathematical framework, which notably provides bounds for the peak of the infectious rate.</li>
                    
                    <li>The theory identifies two distinct phases of disease dynamics: a 'pandemic phase' characterized by uncontrolled spread and a 'response regime' where spread is contained.</li>
                    
                    <li>The model demonstrates excellent descriptive power for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggesting its relevance to real-world scenarios.</li>
                    
                    <li>A key quantitative finding is that an estimated 30% of recovered agents in the Wuhan outbreak developed lasting immunity under the model's assumptions.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study emphasizes that maintaining disease dynamics within the 'response regime' through appropriate control measures is crucial to prevent pandemic escalation, including potential 'second waves'.</li>
                    
                    <li>The authors anticipate the model will inform policy decisions, helping to balance economic impacts with pandemic control strategies.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs field theory to construct a novel mathematical model of epidemic spread. This model integrates a unique mechanism for immunity acquisition, where recovery leads to immunity only if the individual was continuously infected for a period, otherwise reverting to susceptibility. The model's validity is then demonstrated by fitting it to real-world epidemiological data from the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, China.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The model has significant potential to impact clinical and public health decision-making by providing a more nuanced understanding of immunity. It can inform policies regarding the duration and stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the timing and targeting of vaccination campaigns (especially if vaccine-induced immunity mimics natural, non-guaranteed immunity), and resource allocation for healthcare systems by offering better predictions for disease resurgence. It also underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance even after initial infection waves.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests a novel type of disease spread dynamics. WHO states that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are immune from a second infection [WHO]. Conventional mathematical models consider cases for which a recovered individual either becomes susceptible again or develops an immunity. Here, we study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become susceptible again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious rate. Consequently, the theory's phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes the epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. We find that only 30% of the recovered agents have developed an immunity. We anticipate our paper to influence the decision making upon balancing the economic impact and the pandemic impact on society. As long as disease controlling measures keep the disease dynamics in the "response regime", a pandemic escalation ('second wave') is ruled out.</p>
