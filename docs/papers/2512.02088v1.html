                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study demonstrates that 24-hour (J1) diffusion MRI, combined with clinical and lesion-volume features, provides superior prognostic value for predicting three-month functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients compared to baseline (J0) imaging. Utilizing multimodal deep embeddings from 3D ResNet-50, fused with clinical variables and classified by SVM, the J1-based models achieved significantly higher predictive performance (AUC = 0.923) than J0 models (AUC <= 0.86). The robust multimodal framework offers a promising tool for personalized stroke prognosis.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized a multimodal deep learning framework. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 was employed to generate deep embeddings from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) MRI scans obtained at baseline (J0) and 24 hours (J1) post-stroke. These image embeddings were then fused with structured clinical variables and specific lesion-volume features. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the combined features to 12 or fewer components. Finally, linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used for classification to predict three-month functional outcomes, with model evaluation performed via eight-fold stratified group cross-validation.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This study provides compelling evidence that imaging performed 24 hours post-stroke treatment is more valuable for predicting long-term functional recovery than pre-treatment imaging. Clinically, this could lead to a paradigm shift in prognostic imaging for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS), allowing clinicians to make earlier, more informed decisions regarding patient management, resource allocation for rehabilitation, and realistic outcome expectations. The robust and interpretable multimodal framework offers a promising tool for personalized prognosis, potentially optimizing patient care pathways.</p>

                <p class="abstract">This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.</p>
