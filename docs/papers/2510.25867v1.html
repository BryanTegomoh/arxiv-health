                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedVLSynther employs a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework. The generator automatically produces multiple-choice VQA questions (stems and mutually exclusive options) from figures, captions, and in-text references within open biomedical literature (specifically PubMed Central), structured by a machine-checkable JSON schema. A multi-stage verifier rigorously checks generated items against essential criteria such as self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, and image-text consistency, utilizing a system of positive points and penalties for acceptance. The resulting MedSynVQA dataset is then used to train open-weight LMMs via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, and their performance is evaluated across six diverse medical VQA benchmarks. Ablation studies and contamination analyses were conducted to validate the framework's components and ensure data integrity.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The MedVLSynther pipeline successfully created MedSynVQA, a dataset containing 13,087 high-quality, audited VQA questions derived from 14,803 images across 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with MedSynVQA significantly improved accuracy on medical VQA benchmarks, achieving average scores of 55.85% (3B LMM) and 58.15% (7B LMM), with notable peak performance on VQA-RAD (77.57%) and PathVQA (67.76%), thereby outperforming other strong medical LMMs. Critical to this success, both the generation and multi-stage verification components were empirically proven necessary, and increasing the quantity of verified data consistently led to better model performance. No data leakage from evaluation suites was detected.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.</p>
