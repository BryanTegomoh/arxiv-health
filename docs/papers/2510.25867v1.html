                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedVLSynther employs a rubric-guided generator-verifier LMM framework. A generator LMM synthesizes multiple-choice VQA items (self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options) from open biomedical literature, specifically conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references, adhering to a machine-checkable JSON schema. A multi-stage verifier LMM then evaluates these generated questions, enforcing essential gates such as self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, and image-text consistency, while awarding positive points and penalizing common failure modes. The accepted, high-quality VQA data (MedSynVQA) is subsequently used to train open-weight LMMs via reinforcement learning, leveraging verifiable rewards to optimize performance on medical VQA tasks.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The MedVLSynther pipeline successfully produced MedSynVQA, a robust dataset of 13,087 audited medical VQA questions across 14,803 images, covering 13 diverse imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions from PubMed Central. Training open-weight LMMs (3B and 7B parameters) with this synthetic data through reinforcement learning yielded substantial performance improvements, achieving average accuracies of 55.85% (3B) and 58.15% (7B) across six medical VQA benchmarks. Notably, it attained up to 77.57% accuracy on VQA-RAD and 67.76% on PathVQA, outperforming existing strong medical LMMs. Ablation studies confirmed the indispensable roles of both the generation and verification components, and that increasing the volume of verified data consistently enhanced model accuracy. A targeted contamination analysis also confirmed no leakage from evaluation suites.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a scalable, auditable, and reproducible method for generating high-quality medical VQA training data, which is critically important for advancing AI applications in clinical practice. Enhanced medical LMMs can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy by offering more precise and context-aware answers to image-related clinical queries, enriching medical education with comprehensive VQA resources, and streamlining research by enabling more efficient and reliable analysis of medical literature and images. The system's transparency and privacy-preserving nature further contribute to its potential for trusted adoption in healthcare environments.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implies that the generation process requires a sophisticated multi-stage verifier to enforce strict quality gates and penalize failure modes, suggesting that initial raw generations may not consistently meet high standards, necessitating rigorous filtering. While the system operates on 'open biomedical literature,' the inherent quality, completeness, and potential biases of these source documents from PubMed Central could implicitly influence the diversity and complexity of the synthesizable questions.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The paper highlights that MedVLSynther offers an 'auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data,' suggesting future work could focus on further scaling up data generation, exploring the application of this framework to other challenging multimodal medical AI tasks, and refining the generator and verifier LMMs to potentially reduce the need for extensive post-generation auditing or improve efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.</p>
