                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and evaluated Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs) to address the scalability issues of human-delivered MI. By fine-tuning three Chinese-capable LLMs on a GPT-4-generated MI-style dialogue corpus, the researchers demonstrated that these MI-LLMs achieved core MI-consistent behaviors, with evaluation metrics approaching those of real MI dialogues, though complex MI skills require further development.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Motivational Interviewing is a powerful, evidence-based approach for improving adherence to medical advice, managing chronic conditions, and promoting healthy lifestyles. Developing scalable AI-driven MI tools could dramatically expand access to personalized behavior change support, making it available to a wider population and alleviating the burden on human counselors in healthcare settings.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved curating five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and leveraging GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt to transcribe multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style conversations. Of these, 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat, Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this custom corpus. Evaluation was conducted using both round-based automatic metrics (BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores) and expert manual coding applying the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Fine-tuning demonstrably improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores across all three models compared to their base versions. Manual coding via MITI 4.2.1 revealed that the MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, as well as MI-adherent ratios, that approached those observed in real MI dialogues. However, the models showed a lower frequency of complex reflections and reduced reflection-to-question ratios, indicating areas for improvement in advanced MI skill application.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides initial evidence for a scalable AI-assisted pathway to support health behavior change. By endowing general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, these MI-LLMs could potentially serve as valuable tools for augmenting human counselors, providing accessible first-line support, or delivering personalized behavior change interventions in various clinical and public health settings, ultimately improving health outcomes without requiring extensive human training resources.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study noted that MI-LLMs were less adept at generating complex reflections and exhibited lower reflection-to-question ratios. The current models were evaluated on a relatively small test set (40 dialogues) and against a specific MI-style corpus generated by GPT-4, which may not fully capture the nuances of real-world MI interactions. Furthermore, the findings are based on a Chinese-language context, and the generalizability to other linguistic and cultural settings needs to be investigated. The study also acknowledges the need for further work on data scale and real-world intervention trials.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future work should focus on increasing the data scale for fine-tuning, particularly to improve the LLMs' proficiency in complex MI skills like evoking and rolling with resistance. Real-world intervention trials are necessary to validate the efficacy and practical utility of MI-LLMs in clinical and health behavior change settings. Further research could also explore the integration of these models into hybrid human-AI counseling systems and their application across diverse populations and languages.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective counseling approach for promoting health behavior change, but its impact is constrained by the need for highly trained human counselors. Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.</p>
