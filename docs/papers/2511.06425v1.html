                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern
machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as
neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to
balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility,
limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex
data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a
general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse
matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning.
NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between
reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a
single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel
manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient
control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and
interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an
intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global
structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow
objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing
pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and
generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation
on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the
NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods
with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable,
general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science
domains.</p>
