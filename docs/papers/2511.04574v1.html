                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses a methodological discrepancy in calculating COVID-19 reproduction numbers (R_0, R_t) using the Lotka-Euler equation when considering Gaussian-distributed serial intervals (SIs) that account for presymptomatic transmission. It highlights that allowing SIs to extend to minus infinity in Lotka-Euler leads to lower R values than predicted by the discretized renewal equation. The main contribution is a reformulated Lotka-Euler equation that incorporates an explicit lower cut-off for Gaussian SI distributions, enabling more consistent and accurate estimation of reproduction numbers in the context of presymptomatic transmission.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper uses mathematical modeling and theoretical formulation. Specifically, it re-derives and formulates the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions of serial intervals, incorporating an explicit lower cut-off. This reformulated equation is then used to analytically explore the implications of presymptomatic transmission on reproduction number calculations, comparing its outputs with those from the discretized renewal equation and common practices of allowing serial intervals to extend to minus infinity.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that the common practice of applying Gaussian-distributed serial intervals (accounting for presymptomatic transmission) to the Lotka-Euler equation by allowing them to extend to minus infinity results in systematically lower reproduction number estimates than those derived from the discretized renewal equation. The paper's novel formulation, which explicitly imposes a lower cut-off on the Gaussian serial interval distribution within the Lotka-Euler equation, provides a more consistent and theoretically sound method for estimating R values, thereby resolving this discrepancy.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work directly impacts the accuracy of epidemiological modeling and the subsequent public health strategies for infectious diseases like COVID-19. More accurate R_0 and R_t estimations mean better-informed decisions on intervention intensity, resource allocation (e.g., hospital beds, testing capacity), and vaccination targets. This helps prevent both over-reaction (unnecessary economic/social disruption) and under-reaction (uncontrolled outbreaks).</p>

The paper's contribution is to address and overcome this specific methodological limitation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, "R" _"0" and "R" _"t" , are
important metrics to assess progress of an epidemic and effectiveness of
preventative interventions undertaken, and also to estimate coverage needed for
vaccination. Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive
cases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal
equation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to
the rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need
the distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections.
In practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between
symptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that
occurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values,
which can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of
the two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the
distribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus
infinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower
reproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation.
Here, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions
including an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences
of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections.</p>
