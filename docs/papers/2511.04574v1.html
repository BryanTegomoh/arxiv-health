                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses inconsistencies in calculating COVID-19 reproduction numbers (R_0, R_t) when accounting for presymptomatic transmission, which leads to negative serial intervals. It formulates the Lotka-Euler equation with an explicit lower cut-off for Gaussian-distributed serial intervals, contrasting it with the discretized renewal equation, to accurately explore the consequences of presymptomatic transmission.</p>

                    <p>The paper primarily employs mathematical modeling approaches, specifically focusing on the renewal equation and the Lotka-Euler equation. It models serial intervals using a Gaussian distribution, extending to negative values due to presymptomatic transmission.

                    <p>The central finding described in the abstract is the identification of a significant discrepancy: commonly allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus infinity within the Lotka-Euler equation leads to lower predicted reproduction numbers than those derived from the discretized renewal equation. The paper's contribution is to provide a corrected formulation of the Lotka-Euler equation with an explicit lower cut-off, addressing this inconsistency.</p>

                <p>This research directly impacts the reliability of epidemiological forecasts and public health interventions. By providing a more accurate method for calculating R numbers, it enables clinicians, epidemiologists, and policymakers to make better informed decisions regarding isolation periods, social distancing measures, healthcare resource allocation, and the design and evaluation of vaccine campaigns, especially for diseases with significant presymptomatic transmission.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract highlights a limitation in common practice: the often-unaccounted discrepancy arising from allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to negative infinity in the Lotka-Euler equation. This leads to an underestimation of R numbers, which the paper aims to correct. The paper itself, as described in the abstract, is a formulation rather than an empirical study, so it addresses a methodological limitation of prior analyses.</p>

                <p>The abstract states the formulated Lotka-Euler equation will be used to "explore the consequences of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections." This implies a direct future application of the developed methodology to analyze real-world or simulated COVID-19 data to quantify the impact of presymptomatic transmission on R-number estimations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, "R" _"0" and "R" _"t" , are
important metrics to assess progress of an epidemic and effectiveness of
preventative interventions undertaken, and also to estimate coverage needed for
vaccination. Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive
cases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal
equation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to
the rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need
the distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections.
In practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between
symptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that
occurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values,
which can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of
the two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the
distribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus
infinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower
reproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation.
Here, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions
including an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences
of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections.</p>
