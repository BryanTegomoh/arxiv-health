                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses a critical inconsistency in calculating COVID-19 reproduction numbers (R0, Rt) when accounting for presymptomatic transmission. It highlights that common applications of the Lotka-Euler equation with Gaussian-distributed serial intervals extending to negative infinity can underestimate R values compared to the renewal equation. The work proposes and formulates a corrected Lotka-Euler equation that incorporates an explicit lower cut-off for these serial interval distributions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate estimation of R0 and Rt is paramount for public health, as it directly informs the severity of an epidemic, the efficacy of preventative measures like lockdowns or mask mandates, and the necessary population immunity levels for vaccination campaigns. Miscalculations can lead to ineffective public health strategies and prolonged disease burden.</p>

                    <li>Reproduction numbers (R0, Rt) are crucial metrics for assessing epidemic progression, intervention effectiveness, and required vaccination coverage.</li>
                    
                    <li>These metrics are linked to daily case numbers via the renewal equation or, during exponential phases, the Lotka-Euler equation, both requiring generation time distribution.</li>
                    
                    <li>For COVID-19, observable serial intervals (time between symptom onsets) are used, which can be negative due to presymptomatic transmission and are often described by a Gaussian distribution.</li>
                    
                    <li>A common methodological flaw is identified: applying the Lotka-Euler equation with Gaussian serial intervals extending to minus infinity leads to lower R predictions than the discretized renewal equation.</li>

                    <p>The paper employs mathematical modeling, specifically by reformulating the Lotka-Euler equation. It adapts the equation to properly incorporate Gaussian distributions for serial intervals, crucially introducing an explicit lower cut-off to address the biological reality of negative serial intervals caused by presymptomatic transmission and to ensure consistency with the discretized renewal equation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding from this abstract is the identification of a significant discrepancy: common applications of the Lotka-Euler equation that allow Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to negative infinity result in an underestimation of reproduction numbers compared to predictions from the discretized renewal equation. The paper's core contribution is the formulation of a corrected Lotka-Euler equation designed to resolve this inconsistency by incorporating an explicit lower cut-off for the serial interval distribution.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By providing a more robust and accurate mathematical framework for calculating R0 and Rt, this research will enable public health authorities and clinicians to better interpret epidemiological data. This leads to more precise assessments of transmission risk, improved design and evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and more effective planning of vaccination strategies, ultimately aiding in better control of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

                <p>The abstract primarily highlights a significant limitation in *existing common methodological practices*: allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus infinity within the Lotka-Euler equation, which leads to an underestimation of reproduction numbers compared to the renewal equation. The paper's proposed formulation aims to directly address and correct this identified limitation.</p>

                <p>The abstract explicitly states that the formulated Lotka-Euler equation, incorporating the explicit lower cut-off for Gaussian-distributed serial intervals, will be used "to explore the consequences of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections." This indicates the next steps involve applying this new model to analyze real-world or simulated data, quantify its impact, and compare results with previous methods.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, "R" _"0" and "R" _"t" , are
important metrics to assess progress of an epidemic and effectiveness of
preventative interventions undertaken, and also to estimate coverage needed for
vaccination. Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive
cases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal
equation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to
the rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need
the distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections.
In practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between
symptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that
occurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values,
which can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of
the two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the
distribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus
infinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower
reproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation.
Here, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions
including an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences
of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections.</p>
