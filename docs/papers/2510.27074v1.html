                <p class="abstract">How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the
idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more
than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful
predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still
lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two
main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the
funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a
rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes
a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two
fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful
experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and
hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the
folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational
breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized
static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning
toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the
first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold,
and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</p>
