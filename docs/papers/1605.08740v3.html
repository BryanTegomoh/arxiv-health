                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper leverages 'spatial big data' for 'surveillance and inference' in infectious diseases. This inherently involves advanced computational methods, often machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI), to process, analyze, and extract insights from diverse data sources like geo-tagged tweets, mobile phone data, and medical claims. This supports applications such as predictive modeling for disease outbreaks, real-time population movement tracking for disease spread, and automated early warning systems for public health threats.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Spatial big data have the "velocity," "volume," and "variety" of big data sources and additional geographic information about the record. Digital data sources, such as medical claims, mobile phone call data records, and geo-tagged tweets, have entered infectious disease epidemiology as novel sources of data to complement traditional infectious disease surveillance. In this work, we provide examples of how spatial big data have been used thus far in epidemiological analyses and describe opportunities for these sources to improve public health coordination and disease mitigation strategies. In addition, we consider the technical, practical, and ethical challenges with the use of spatial big data in infectious disease surveillance and inference. Finally, we discuss the implications of the rising use of spatial big data in epidemiology to health risk communications, across-scale public health coordination, and public health policy recommendation.</p>
