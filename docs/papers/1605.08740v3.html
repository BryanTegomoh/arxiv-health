                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The core findings highlight that spatial big data offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance infectious disease surveillance and inference through novel data sources. However, its effective and ethical deployment necessitates careful consideration and navigation of significant technical (e.g., data integration, processing), practical (e.g., resource allocation, skill gaps), and ethical (e.g., privacy, bias) challenges. The integration of such data has profound implications for health communication, inter-agency coordination, and evidence-based policy formulation.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical and public health impact includes more precise and timely identification of disease outbreaks, improved allocation of healthcare resources during epidemics, enhanced effectiveness of public health interventions through spatially informed targeting, and the development of proactive disease mitigation strategies. It can lead to better health risk communication tailored to specific geographic populations and more responsive public health policies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Spatial big data have the "velocity," "volume," and "variety" of big data sources and additional geographic information about the record. Digital data sources, such as medical claims, mobile phone call data records, and geo-tagged tweets, have entered infectious disease epidemiology as novel sources of data to complement traditional infectious disease surveillance. In this work, we provide examples of how spatial big data have been used thus far in epidemiological analyses and describe opportunities for these sources to improve public health coordination and disease mitigation strategies. In addition, we consider the technical, practical, and ethical challenges with the use of spatial big data in infectious disease surveillance and inference. Finally, we discuss the implications of the rising use of spatial big data in epidemiology to health risk communications, across-scale public health coordination, and public health policy recommendation.</p>
