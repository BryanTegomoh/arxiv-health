                    <p>The study utilized a dataset of 20 paired tissue samples, comprising H&E stained images and non-linear multimodal images. These pairs underwent several preprocessing steps, including four color transformation techniques (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. Image registration was performed using the VALIS method, which sequentially applies rigid registration and then a two-step non-rigid registration on both low and high-resolution images. Performance was quantitatively assessed using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE), specifically the median of median rTRE (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE (AMrTRE), alongside a custom point-based evaluation using ten manually selected key points. The entire process was evaluated under two conditions: using original multimodal images and using inverted multimodal images.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.</p>
