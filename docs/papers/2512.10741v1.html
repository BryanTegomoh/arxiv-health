                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">TRIDENT addresses critical service gaps in emergency speech recognition for Caribbean populations by proposing a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture. It integrates Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, LLM-based entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with complementary signals (transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, vocal stress indicators). This architecture enables human application of established triage protocols (ESI, START) even when automatic speech recognition performance is compromised due to accent. The system leverages low ASR confidence and vocal distress as queue prioritization signals, while also using semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators from composed callers.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This system is critically important for ensuring equitable access to emergency services and appropriate medical triage for Caribbean populations whose distinct accents often lead to ASR failures. By providing structured clinical information and distress signals, TRIDENT aims to significantly improve dispatcher efficiency and accuracy in applying established medical triage protocols like ESI and START, ultimately leading to better and faster patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>TRIDENT is an AI-powered dispatcher support system that integrates Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, large language models for local entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection. It provides dispatchers with transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. This AI application aims to prioritize emergency calls, especially those from callers in crisis or reporting life-threatening emergencies, and facilitate the human application of medical triage protocols (ESI, START), thereby ensuring more equitable and efficient access to emergency healthcare services.</p>

                    <p>The paper describes a conceptual architectural design for TRIDENT, a three-layer dispatcher-support system. It outlines the integration of Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, LLM-based local entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection. The methodology is primarily theoretical and design-oriented, establishing a framework grounded in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, rather than presenting empirical results.</p>

                    <p>The primary 'findings' are the novel architectural design and the underlying theoretical insights: (1) A redundant system combining transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators can enhance emergency triage for accent-diverse populations. (2) Low ASR confidence is not merely a failure but a valuable signal for call prioritization when paired with vocal distress. (3) Semantic analysis is crucial for extracting clinical information from composed callers who may not exhibit distress. (4) Psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching provides a theoretical foundation for understanding speech variations in crisis, informing system design.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>TRIDENT has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy, speed, and equity of emergency call triage for Caribbean-accented callers, thereby reducing health disparities. It would empower dispatchers with structured, contextually relevant clinical information from even challenging calls, enabling more precise application of established medical triage protocols (ESI, START). This could lead to more efficient allocation of emergency resources, faster response times, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes in both daily operations and disaster scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.</p>
