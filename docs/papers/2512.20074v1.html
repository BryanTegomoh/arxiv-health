                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Reason2Decide implements a two-stage training paradigm. Stage-1 focuses on fine-tuning the model for rationale generation. Stage-2 then jointly optimizes for both label prediction and rationale generation, incorporating scheduled sampling. Scheduled sampling is a technique where the model's input during training progressively transitions from using gold-standard (true) labels to using its own predicted labels, thereby mitigating exposure bias. The evaluation was conducted on three medical datasets: a proprietary triage dataset and two public biomedical question-answering datasets, measuring F1 score for prediction and BERTScore, BLEU, and LLM-as-a-Judge for rationale fidelity.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Reason2Decide consistently outperforms fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in both predictive accuracy (F1) and the quality of generated rationales across diverse medical datasets. It demonstrates significant robustness to the source of rationales (human vs. LLM-generated). Remarkably, LLM-generated rationales alone in Stage-1 proved effective for pretraining, reducing annotation dependence. These performance benefits are achieved with models that are 40 times smaller than leading foundation models.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability of Reason2Decide to provide highly accurate and aligned explanations using significantly smaller models has a profound clinical impact. It enables the deployment of explainable AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings, democratizing access to advanced decision support. Clinicians can benefit from transparent recommendations in critical areas like patient triage, enhancing trust, reducing cognitive load, and potentially leading to more consistent and effective patient management and improved outcomes. The reduced reliance on human annotation for training also makes such systems more scalable and cost-effective to develop.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.</p>
