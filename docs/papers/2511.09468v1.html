                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research paper investigates the nuclear reactions occurring during proton therapy, specifically focusing on the production of short-lived $β^+$ emitting radioisotopes like $^{11}$C, $^{13}$N, and $^{15}$O. The authors measured the cross sections for the creation of these isotopes using various target materials relevant to biological tissues (C, BN, SiO$_2$). Their experimental results, obtained with proton beams below 58 MeV, precisely follow previously established excitation functions with high accuracy (a few percent uncertainty), contributing crucial data for in-beam Positron Emission Tomography (PET) applications.</p>

                <p>The data presented (cross-section measurements for in-situ PET isotope production) could be used to train and validate AI models for several health applications: 
1. **AI-driven Treatment Planning Systems:** To more accurately predict dose distribution, secondary radiation, and activation products within the patient during proton therapy, optimizing treatment plans for efficacy and safety. 
2. **AI-enhanced Range Verification:** Machine learning algorithms could be developed to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of these short-lived $β^+$ emitters, detected via in-beam PET or prompt gamma imaging, to provide real-time feedback on proton beam range and verify target coverage, significantly improving treatment accuracy. 
3. **AI for Quality Assurance:** AI models could monitor and analyze the activation patterns to detect deviations from expected dose delivery, indicating potential issues with treatment delivery.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">During proton therapy, the beam flux decreases due to inelastic interactions with nuclei. At the highest energies used in proton therapy around 25\% protons initiate nuclear reactions. This report presents the cross section measurements of proton-induced production of three $β^+$ emitters -- $^{11}$C, $^{13}$N, $^{15}$O -- with half-lives between 2 and 20 minutes, using solid C, BN and SiO$_2$ targets. Stacks of up to 15 targets were irradiated simultaneously with proton beams of kinetic energy below 58 MeV at the AIC-144 cyclotron of the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences. The measured cross sections follow the excitation function obtained in the previous experiments, with uncertainty of a few percent.</p>
