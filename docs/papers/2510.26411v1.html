                    <p>The methodology involves applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP, a vision-language model pre-trained on chest radiographs and associated clinical reports.

This indicates MedSAEs effectively distill complex, entangled representations into more granular, human-understandable concepts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.</p>
