                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to enhance the interpretability of MedCLIP, a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs. By applying MedSAEs to MedCLIP's latent space, the study demonstrates that the resulting MedSAE neurons achieve significantly higher monosemanticity and interpretability compared to raw MedCLIP features, evaluated on the CheXpert dataset.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.</p>
