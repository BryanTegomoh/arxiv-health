                    <p>The study involved developing the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), an FSL framework for multimodal data (speech, physiological, video). HCFSLN utilizes hyperbolic embeddings to project features into a non-Euclidean space for enhanced separability, a cross-modal attention mechanism to integrate diverse data streams, and an adaptive gating network for robust classification with limited data. The model was trained and evaluated on a newly collected multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked against six established FSL baselines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Anxiety disorders impact millions globally, yet traditional diagnosis relies
on clinical interviews, while machine learning models struggle with overfitting
due to limited data. Large-scale data collection remains costly and
time-consuming, restricting accessibility. To address this, we introduce the
Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), a novel Few-Shot
Learning (FSL) framework for multimodal anxiety detection, integrating speech,
physiological signals, and video data. HCFSLN enhances feature separability
through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating
network, enabling robust classification with minimal data. We collected a
multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked HCFSLN against
six FSL baselines, achieving 88% accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by
14%. These results highlight the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling
anxiety-related speech patterns and demonstrate FSL's potential for anxiety
classification.</p>
