                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SDE-Attention, a novel family of Stochastic Differential Equation-Recurrent Neural Networks (SDE-RNNs) augmented with channel-level attention mechanisms applied to the latent pre-RNN state. Designed to address the prevalent challenge of irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing data in fields like healthcare, the proposed models consistently outperform a vanilla SDE-RNN baseline. Notably, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model (SDE-TVF-L) demonstrated significant accuracy gains, achieving up to a 10 percentage point improvement on univariate datasets and up to 7% on multivariate benchmarks under high missingness.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Irregularly sampled data and substantial missing observations are pervasive in medical records, patient monitoring, and clinical trials due to varied sampling intervals, missed appointments, or sensor malfunctions. This research offers a robust and accurate methodology for modeling such complex and incomplete medical time series, which is crucial for reliable diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks. We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.</p>
