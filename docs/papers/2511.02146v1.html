                <p class="summary-text">CausalDDS is a novel framework for drug synergy prediction that addresses the limitations of existing black-box methods by disentangling drug molecules into causal and spurious substructures. It leverages these causal representations, combined with conditional interventions and a sufficiency-independence optimization objective, to enhance prediction accuracy and provide molecular-level interpretability. The model demonstrates superior performance, especially in challenging cold-start and out-of-distribution scenarios, and effectively identifies key substructures responsible for synergistic effects.</p>

Its core methodology involves: 1) **Substructure Disentanglement**: Decomposing drug representations into latent spaces corresponding to 'causal' substructures (those directly contributing to synergy) and 'spurious' substructures (statistically correlated but not causally related). 2) **Causal Representation Learning**: Utilizing only the causal substructure representations for the downstream synergy prediction task. 3) **Conditional Intervention Mechanism**: Implementing a causal intervention strategy during training that is conditioned on the paired molecular structures of the drug combination to robustly learn causal effects. 4) **Novel Optimization Objective**: Guiding the model's learning with an objective function designed around the principles of *sufficiency* (ensuring causal factors are adequate for prediction) and *independence* (promoting disentanglement between causal and spurious factors).</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.</p>
