                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning-radiomics framework designed for precise, joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation in contrast-enhanced CT images. The proposed multi-stage approach combines an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net for initial probability maps, inter-slice consistency enforcement, radiomics-based false-positive rejection, and a 3D patch-based CNN for final boundary refinement. This aims to overcome challenges of manual contouring, such as slowness and observer dependency, and common auto-segmentation difficulties like low contrast and blurred boundaries.</p>

                <p>The AI application is the automated, precise three-dimensional segmentation of liver tumors and the liver parenchyma from CT scans. This technology aims to overcome limitations of manual contouring (slowness, observer dependency, lack of standardization) by using deep learning (U-Net, CNNs) and radiomics.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed method is a sequential multi-stage hybrid framework. It begins with a 2.5D attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net that takes short stacks of axial slices as input to produce initial liver and tumor probability maps. This is followed by a three-slice refinement rule applied along the cranio-caudal axis to enforce inter-slice consistency, restoring small lesions and suppressing noise. Next, a radiomics module extracts 728 descriptors (intensity, texture, shape, boundary, wavelet) from candidate lesions, reduces them to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy selection, and uses a Random Forest classifier to reject false positives. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN (derived from AlexNet) performs voxel-level relabeling and contour smoothing in a narrow band around the tumor boundary.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate three-dimensional delineation of liver tumors on contrast-enhanced CT is a prerequisite for treatment planning, navigation and response assessment, yet manual contouring is slow, observer-dependent and difficult to standardise across centres. Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing.</p>
