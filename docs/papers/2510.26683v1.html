                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Evontree proposes a novel framework for domain adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in data-sensitive fields like healthcare by leveraging a small set of high-quality ontology rules. It systematically extracts, validates, and enhances domain knowledge within LLMs through a three-step process: ontology extraction, inconsistency detection, and self-distilled fine-tuning. This approach significantly improves LLM performance on medical QA benchmarks (up to 3.7% accuracy) without requiring extensive external datasets, proving effective for low-resource adaptation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.</p>
