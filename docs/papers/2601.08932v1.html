                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study employed computational simulations to investigate the impact of hemodynamic changes following neonatal Truncus Arteriosus (TA) repair on the performance of an associated quadricuspid valve, without direct leaflet intervention. The simulations accurately predicted that altered postoperative hemodynamics significantly improved valve coaptation and eliminated regurgitation, mirroring in-vivo clinical observations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a powerful in-silico tool to predict and understand the functional outcomes of truncal valve performance after TA repair, offering crucial insights that could help surgeons determine which patients may benefit from TA repair alone versus those requiring additional direct leaflet intervention, potentially improving surgical planning and long-term patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes using 'simulations' and 'in-silico modeling' to predict patient-specific valve performance and identify mechanisms of improvement after surgery. This falls under the umbrella of computational modeling and predictive analytics in healthcare. While not explicitly labeled as 'AI' (e.g., deep learning), these advanced computational methods are foundational for personalized medicine, 'digital twin' applications, and data-driven clinical decision support, which are key areas of medical AI applications.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research suggests that the primary surgical repair of Truncus Arteriosus, by normalizing patient hemodynamics, can inherently improve the function of an associated quadricuspid valve. This could potentially reduce the necessity for direct, complex, and high-risk surgical interventions on the valve leaflets during the initial repair, leading to fewer re-operations, reduced morbidity, and improved long-term prognosis for these vulnerable neonatal patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Truncus arteriosus (TA) is a rare and severe congenital heart disease. Quadricuspid valve morphology occurs in 25% of all TA patients and is linked to regurgitation and increased risk of re-operation. It remains unclear how hemodynamic changes after TA repair alter valve performance. This study simulated pre- and postoperative conditions in a neonatal TA patient to investigate valve performance without direct intervention. We hypothesize that valve performance before and after truncal repair can be predicted in-silico, matching in-vivo imaging and identifying mechanisms how hemodynamic changes after repair will reduce valve regurgitation without direct intervention. Pre- and postoperative CT images of a neonatal patient with quadricuspid valve were segmented. Free edge length and geometric height from the patient's echocardiogram were used to model the valve. For the preoperative condition, ventricular pressures were set equal modeling an unrestricted ventricular septal defect. Systemic and pulmonary resistances were tuned based on the patient's Qp:Qs ratio. For the postoperative condition, boundary conditions were modified to mimic patient-specific hemodynamics after TA repair. The preoperative simulation confirmed mild valve regurgitation seen in-vivo. Interaction between asymmetric flow and surrounding vessel resulted in asymmetric opening and closing. Poor central coaptation led to a central regurgitant jet toward the septum. Altered postoperative hemodynamics improved coaptation and eliminated regurgitation, as seen in-vivo. This modeling approach reproduced in-vivo pre- and postoperative valve performance and identified mechanisms improving coaptation after TA repair. TA repair led to elimination of regurgitation due to enhanced central coaptation. Thus, altered postoperative hemodynamic conditions after TA repair may improve valve performance without direct leaflet intervention.</p>
