                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This visual analytics framework directly supports the development, debugging, and validation of GNNs used in various medical AI applications. For example, it could enable a drug discovery scientist to understand why a GNN predicts a certain molecular compound as a viable drug candidate by visualizing the subgraph influencing the decision. It could help clinicians or researchers diagnose why a GNN misclassified a patient's disease risk by interactively perturbing patient features or network connections. Furthermore, it aids in detecting and mitigating biases within GNN models used for patient stratification or treatment recommendations, which is crucial for ethical AI in healthcare. By providing 'what-if' analysis, it allows rigorous probing of model sensitivity to input changes, enhancing the robustness and trustworthiness of medical AI systems.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in graph-based learning tasks, but their complex, non-linear operations often render them as opaque "black boxes". This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a "what-if" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.</p>
