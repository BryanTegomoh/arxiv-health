                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">CATCH is a novel plug-and-play framework designed to overcome the significant performance degradation of Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, such as LLaVA, when applied to out-of-domain data like medical imaging. It achieves this by decoupling visual and linguistic adaptation through a lightweight domain classifier and a dual adapter mechanism (Prompt and Visual Adapters), dynamically injected via a hook interface. The framework demonstrates consistent and substantial performance gains across diverse domain-specific VQA benchmarks, notably +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, without requiring retraining of the backbone VQA model.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>CATCH employs a modular, plug-and-play architecture that decouples visual and linguistic adaptation processes. It integrates a lightweight domain classifier to identify the input image's type. Subsequently, a dual adapter mechanism is utilized, consisting of a Prompt Adapter responsible for language modulation and a Visual Adapter for adjusting vision features. Both these adaptation modules are dynamically injected into the pre-trained VQA backbone via a unified hook interface, critically eliminating the need for retraining the entire backbone model.</p>

                <p>CATCH has the potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of advanced VQA models in clinical practice. By enabling existing, powerful VQA systems to effectively interpret and reason over diverse medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRI, CT scans) without extensive retraining for each specific medical domain or dataset, it reduces development costs and deployment time. This facilitates the creation of more versatile, adaptable, and accessible AI-powered diagnostic and analytical tools, potentially aiding radiologists and other clinicians in complex image interpretation and question answering tasks, ultimately improving patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.</p>
