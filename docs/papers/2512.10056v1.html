                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), a novel autoregressive forecasting method designed to mitigate exposure bias, a common issue in predictive control systems for medical applications. SoTra propagates continuous probability distributions ("soft tokens") to learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories, incorporating a risk-aware decoding module to minimize expected clinical harm. The method demonstrates significant reductions in average zone-based risk for glucose forecasting (18%) and effective clinical risk for blood-pressure forecasting (15%).</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research directly addresses a critical challenge in developing safe and effective closed-loop predictive control systems for medical applications like artificial pancreas in diabetes or automated hemodynamic management. By improving forecast stability, uncertainty awareness, and explicitly minimizing clinical risk, it paves the way for more reliable and safer automated medical interventions, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and reduced adverse events.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research develops an AI model (SoTra) for real-time predictive control in medical contexts. Specifically, it forecasts glucose levels for diabetes management (e.g., for automated insulin delivery systems) and blood pressure for hemodynamic management in critical care. The AI application aims to provide more stable, calibrated, and uncertainty-aware multi-step forecasts, ultimately reducing clinical risk and harm in safety-critical medical devices and decision-making systems.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>SoTra (Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting) addresses exposure bias by propagating continuous probability distributions, or "soft tokens," through its autoregressive structure instead of discrete predictions. This allows the model to learn more robust, calibrated, and uncertainty-aware predictive trajectories. A key component is a risk-aware decoding module that leverages knowledge of varying clinical risks across different physiological operating zones to minimize the expected clinical harm during the forecasting process.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.</p>
