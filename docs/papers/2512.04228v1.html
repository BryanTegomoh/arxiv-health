                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the susceptibility of current Large Language Models (LLMs) to logical fallacies, especially in scientific reasoning with negation or faulty premises, due to their affirmation-based inference. It demonstrates these systematic weaknesses in existing LLMs and proposes a novel dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial to foster more robust and logically sound models.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic and consistent weaknesses when performing scientific reasoning, particularly when tasks involve negation, counterexamples, or premises known to be faulty. The dominant affirmation-based inference training paradigm leaves these models vulnerable to logical fallacies and unreliable causal reasoning. The proposed dual-reasoning framework offers a principled approach to mitigate these issues by enabling models to both confirm valid inferences and actively deny invalid ones.</p>

                <p>By enhancing LLM logical soundness and robustness, this research can lead to more reliable and trustworthy clinical decision support systems, reducing the risk of medical errors stemming from flawed AI reasoning. Improved LLMs could more accurately interpret complex patient data, synthesize medical literature for evidence-based practice, and accelerate drug discovery by drawing logically sound conclusions, ultimately leading to safer and more effective patient care and research outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and hold growing promise for advancing science, healthcare, and decision-making. Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness. By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning.</p>
