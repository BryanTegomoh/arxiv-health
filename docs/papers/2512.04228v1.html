                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the susceptibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to logical fallacies, especially when reasoning with negation or faulty premises, due to their prevalent affirmation-based inference. It demonstrates these systematic weaknesses in existing LLMs within scientific domains and introduces a novel dual-reasoning training framework. This framework integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial, computationally mirroring "denying the antecedent," to enable models that both affirm valid and explicitly reject invalid inferences, enhancing robustness and logical alignment with human reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>The reliability of LLMs in healthcare hinges on their ability to perform sound causal reasoning and avoid logical fallacies when processing complex medical data or assisting in clinical decision-making. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for developing trustworthy AI tools for diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical research, where erroneous inferences could have severe consequences.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves two primary contributions: first, an empirical demonstration of logical weaknesses in existing LLMs through experiments involving scientific reasoning scenarios with negation, counterexamples, and faulty premises (with code provided for replication). Second, the introduction of a theoretical and practical 'dual-reasoning training framework' that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial, formalizing 'denying the antecedent' via negation-aware objectives and adversarial training principles.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that current LLMs from major platforms systematically struggle with scientific reasoning that requires understanding negation, processing counterexamples, or evaluating premises that are faulty. These models are vulnerable to logical fallacies due to their inherent affirmation-based inference mechanisms, failing to adequately disconfirm invalid inferences.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Improving LLM logical soundness directly translates to safer and more effective clinical applications. Enhanced causal reasoning and reduced susceptibility to logical fallacies mean more reliable diagnostic hypotheses, safer drug interaction predictions, more accurate interpretation of patient data, and better-informed treatment recommendations, ultimately reducing medical errors and improving patient outcomes in critical healthcare contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and hold growing promise for advancing science, healthcare, and decision-making. Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness. By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning.</p>
