                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces PromptCT, a deep unfolding framework for sparse-view Computed Tomography (SVCT) reconstruction that addresses two key limitations: the lack of explicit Lipschitz constraint proofs in prior networks and the high storage costs associated with training separate models for multiple view settings. PromptCT integrates LipNet, an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, and a prompt module, allowing a single model to handle various sparse-view configurations with theoretical convergence guarantees. The method achieves superior reconstruction quality and significantly reduces storage overhead compared to benchmark algorithms in both simulated and real data experiments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.
