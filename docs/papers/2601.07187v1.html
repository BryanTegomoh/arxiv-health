                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This report analyzes changes in NIH funding for medical physics research between FY24 and FY25, revealing a significant shift in award composition despite stable overall funding for AAPM members. It identifies a 50% decline in competing awards, primarily due to an 80% collapse in new NCI R01 grants, raising critical concerns about the long-term stability and innovation capacity of the medical physics research pipeline.</p>

                    <p>The study employed a data linkage approach, connecting the membership database of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) with records from the NIH RePORTER system. This allowed for the quantification and analysis of NIH funding distribution specifically for projects where the principal investigator was an AAPM researcher, comparing funding trends between fiscal years FY24 and FY25.</p>

                    <p>Total NIH funding to AAPM members remained stable; however, competing awards declined by 50%, with new NCI R01 grants collapsing by 80%. In contrast, noncompeting continuation awards saw a 10% increase. These changes are contextualized by disruptions in NIH review and grantmaking processes, including delays and increased administrative demands.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The severe decline in new competitive grants, particularly from the NCI, will likely slow the development and translation of novel medical physics technologies into clinical practice. This directly impacts advancements in cancer diagnosis and treatment, potentially limiting future options for patients and hindering the training of experts crucial for delivering cutting-edge care.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the study's methodology, but notes that the observed funding shifts occurred within a broader context of widespread disruptions to NIH review and grantmaking. This suggests external systemic factors significantly influenced the data. The analysis is also limited to a two-year period (FY24-FY25), providing a snapshot rather than a comprehensive long-term trend.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated as research directions, the findings implicitly call for urgent attention and potential policy interventions to address the identified funding vulnerabilities. Future efforts should focus on strategies to stabilize and enhance federal support for medical physics research, particularly for new and renewal competitive grants, to ensure a robust pipeline for innovation and the continued support of early-stage investigators vital for future medical advancements.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This report summarizes changes in federal research funding to the medical physics community between FY24 and FY25. By linking the AAPM membership database with NIH RePORTER records, we quantified the distribution of NIH funding for projects led by AAPM researchers. Although total NIH funding to AAPM members remained relatively stable across the two years, the composition of that funding shifted substantially. Competing (new and renewal) awards declined 50%, driven largely by an 80% collapse in new R01 grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In contrast, noncompeting continuation awards increased by 10%, following a shift in how NIH funds multi-year projects. These changes occurred in the context of widespread disruptions to NIH review and grantmaking, including delayed study sections and more stringent administrative requirements. Federal funding is essential to sustaining innovation, supporting early-stage investigators, and ensuring that patients receive the best possible care. The trends identified here raise concerns about the long-term vitality and stability of the medical physics research pipeline.</p>
