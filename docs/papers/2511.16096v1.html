                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an Agent-based model to analyze Hepatitis B prevalence dynamics in the Thai-Myanmar border region, highlighting the disparity between Thai and migrant populations. It revealed that current interventions, while effective for Thai citizens, are insufficient for national elimination targets due to persistent high prevalence among migrants, underscoring the critical need for improved healthcare access in these communities.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides vital evidence for public health policy, demonstrating that national disease elimination strategies must specifically address inequities in healthcare access for vulnerable populations like migrants. It underscores the necessity of targeted, culturally sensitive, and financially accessible interventions to achieve comprehensive public health goals.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper uses an Agent-based model, which is a computational simulation technique. While these models are powerful tools for understanding complex systems and informing decisions, they are generally not classified as 'medical AI applications' in the common sense (e.g., machine learning for diagnosis, drug discovery, or personalized medicine). It's a computational modeling application for public health, not explicitly AI.</p>

                    <li>Hepatitis B remains endemic in Thailand, with elevated prevalence observed in the Thai-Myanmar border region and among migrant populations due to physical, financial, and cultural healthcare access barriers.</li>
                    
                    <li>An Agent-based model (ABM) was developed to capture population heterogeneity, explicitly distinguishing between Thai and migrant groups by modeling individual origin, mobility, healthcare access levels, and baseline Hepatitis B prevalence.</li>
                    
                    <li>The model was utilized to simulate future Hepatitis B prevalence trends under various intervention scenarios, assessing their effectiveness towards national elimination targets.</li>
                    
                    <li>Results indicated that current Hepatitis B intervention levels, despite being effective within the Thai population, are inadequate for achieving national elimination due to the sustained high prevalence among migrants.</li>

                    <li>Existing policies aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for migrants and border communities are currently ineffective, primarily due to unresolved financial and cultural barriers.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed an Agent-based model (ABM) that explicitly captured the demographic and epidemiological differences between Thai and migrant populations in the Thai-Myanmar border region. This model incorporated factors such as higher mobility, lower healthcare access, and elevated Hepatitis B prevalence among migrants, by explicitly defining the origin of each simulated individual. The ABM was then used to project future Hepatitis B prevalence trends under different intervention scenarios.</p>

                    <p>The current Hepatitis B intervention program is effective for the Thai population but insufficient to reach national elimination targets due to the high prevalence among migrants. Improving healthcare access for migrants and the border region is crucial for achieving elimination, and the study quantified the required level of improvement. Existing policies for migrant healthcare access are hindered by unaddressed financial and cultural barriers, limiting their effectiveness.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings suggest that clinical and public health programs must explicitly address financial and cultural barriers preventing migrants from accessing healthcare. This could involve developing specific outreach programs, culturally competent health services, and financial subsidies for migrant populations. Implementing these targeted strategies could significantly reduce Hepatitis B transmission and contribute to achieving national elimination targets, directly influencing clinical practice in border regions by advocating for equitable care.</p>

                <p>The abstract highlights a key limitation of *real-world policy implementation*, stating that existing policies to improve healthcare access for migrants are "still not yet effective due to financial and cultural barriers."

                <p>The research strongly implies that future efforts should focus on actively "bringing down those [financial and cultural] barriers" to make existing healthcare access policies effective for migrants and border communities. This involves developing and implementing strategies to overcome these specific obstacles to achieve reduced Hepatitis B prevalence and contribute to national elimination targets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Introduction: In Thailand, Hepatitis B is still endemic despite a strong program to eliminate the disease. A higher prevalence is reported in the border region and among migrants due to physical, financial and cultural barriers. Policies and programs targeting the border region and migrant communities have been suggested. Models can be used to understand and quantify the impact of these policies, given they can capture the heterogeneity within the population.
  Methods: In this study, we developed an Agent-based model that captures the differences between the Thai and migrant populations living in this region, notably the higher level of mobility, lower access to healthcare, and the higher prevalence of Hepatitis B among migrants, by modelling the origin of each individual explicitly. We used the model to estimate future trends of Hepatitis B prevalence in Thailand near the border with Myanmar under different scenarios of intervention.
  Results: Our study shows that although the current intervention level is effective in the Thai population, it is insufficient to reach national elimination targets due to high prevalence in migrants. Improving access to healthcare for migrants and the border region could potentially help to reach elimination targets, and we quantified the level of improvement needed to achieve elimination.
  Conclusion: Although there already exist policies to make healthcare more accessible to migrants and the border regions, they are still not yet effective due to financial and cultural barriers. Bringing down those barriers could reduce Hepatitis B prevalence in those communities and regions and contribute to reaching elimination targets in a reasonable timeline.</p>
