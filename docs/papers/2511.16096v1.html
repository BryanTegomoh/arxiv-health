                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an Agent-based model to analyze Hepatitis B (HBV) prevalence in the Thai-Myanmar border region, explicitly differentiating between Thai and migrant populations. It found that current interventions, while effective for Thais, are insufficient for national HBV elimination targets due to high prevalence among migrants, and quantifies the necessary improvement in migrant healthcare access.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides crucial quantitative evidence highlighting health inequities as a major impediment to disease elimination goals. It underscores the necessity of targeted, culturally sensitive, and financially accessible healthcare interventions for vulnerable migrant populations to achieve broader public health objectives.</p>

                <p>Not applicable. The paper utilizes an Agent-based model for simulation, which is a computational modeling technique, but it does not fall under typical definitions of Artificial Intelligence applications in medicine (e.g., machine learning for diagnosis, predictive analytics using neural networks, natural language processing for clinical notes, etc.).</p>

                    <p>The study found that current Hepatitis B intervention levels are effective for the Thai population but insufficient to reach national elimination targets due to the persistently high prevalence within migrant communities. It demonstrated that improving healthcare access specifically for migrants and residents of the border region could enable the achievement of elimination targets, and the model quantified the necessary level of this improvement. Crucially, existing policies for migrant healthcare access are rendered ineffective by persistent financial and cultural barriers.</p>

                <p>This research provides a strong evidence base for public health policymakers to re-evaluate and enhance strategies for Hepatitis B elimination, specifically targeting migrant populations. It highlights the urgent need to implement interventions that actively dismantle financial and cultural barriers to healthcare access for these vulnerable groups, which would directly impact disease transmission and prevalence in clinical settings and communities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Introduction: In Thailand, Hepatitis B is still endemic despite a strong program to eliminate the disease. A higher prevalence is reported in the border region and among migrants due to physical, financial and cultural barriers. Policies and programs targeting the border region and migrant communities have been suggested. Models can be used to understand and quantify the impact of these policies, given they can capture the heterogeneity within the population.
  Methods: In this study, we developed an Agent-based model that captures the differences between the Thai and migrant populations living in this region, notably the higher level of mobility, lower access to healthcare, and the higher prevalence of Hepatitis B among migrants, by modelling the origin of each individual explicitly. We used the model to estimate future trends of Hepatitis B prevalence in Thailand near the border with Myanmar under different scenarios of intervention.
  Results: Our study shows that although the current intervention level is effective in the Thai population, it is insufficient to reach national elimination targets due to high prevalence in migrants. Improving access to healthcare for migrants and the border region could potentially help to reach elimination targets, and we quantified the level of improvement needed to achieve elimination.
  Conclusion: Although there already exist policies to make healthcare more accessible to migrants and the border regions, they are still not yet effective due to financial and cultural barriers. Bringing down those barriers could reduce Hepatitis B prevalence in those communities and regions and contribute to reaching elimination targets in a reasonable timeline.</p>
