                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces LUME-DBN, a novel Gibbs sampling-based full Bayesian method designed for learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) directly from incomplete longitudinal clinical data. It addresses the critical limitation of existing missing data imputation techniques that fail to properly account for the temporal nature of medical datasets, especially in intensive care. By treating missing values as unknown Gaussian parameters sampled from their full conditional distributions, the approach achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and convergence compared to standard model-agnostic methods like MICE, leading to more reliable imputations and supporting safer clinical decisions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.</p>
