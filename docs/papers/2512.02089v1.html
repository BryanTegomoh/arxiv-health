                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the design of a portable, inexpensive, mixed-signal data-logging system for comprehensive breath-gas analysis, aiming to revolutionize respiratory disease diagnosis. By simultaneously measuring a synergistic set of exhaled gases and mass flow, the device seeks to enable early detection of respiratory ailments, addressing the limitations of current cumbersome and late diagnostic methods. The system, developed in various form factors (mask-mounted, tabletop, handheld), is envisioned to establish a new set of clinical vitals, significantly improving disease prognosis and quality of life.</p>

                <p>This technology offers a transformative approach to respiratory diagnostics by providing an accessible, comprehensive, and proactive tool for early disease detection.

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Although the paper does not explicitly mention AI, the proposed system is a 'data-logging system' that measures a 'comprehensive set of pertinent gases and mass flow' (biomarkers). The interpretation of these 'interrelated breathing biomarkers' to gain a 'synergistic view' and enable 'early diagnosis' is an ideal application for machine learning and artificial intelligence. AI models could be trained on the collected multi-parameter data to identify complex patterns indicative of specific respiratory conditions, predict disease severity, or personalize treatment recommendations, thereby augmenting clinical decision-making and diagnostic accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Respiratory ailments are increasing globally at an alarming rate and are currently one of the leading factors of death and infirmity worldwide. Among respiratory diseases, those linked to poor air quality and pollutants are increasing at a proportionally higher rate than those linked to viral or other factors. Diagnosing disorders of the respiratory system is often performed initially by routine physical examinations and questionnaires. Once most patients have symptoms that are severe enough to warrant clinical testing, the ailment could have already caused pulmonary damage. Clinical diagnosis involves the use of cumbersome, expensive equipment that measures different parameters separately, e.g., Capnography (CO2) and spirometry (bidirectional tidal mass flow). These disparate sets of data must then be interpreted collectively by a qualified medical practitioner. This paper details the design of a portable, inexpensive, mixed-signal data-logging system that measures a chosen set of parameters in exhaled breath from humans or animals. The data is a comprehensive set of pertinent gases and mass flow that when looked at simultaneously, gives a synergistic view of these interrelated breathing biomarkers and thus the state of the respiratory system as a whole. A mask-mounted, tabletop, and handheld version was developed for different applications. The system, when fully developed, would enable a new set of clinical vitals that only require a patient to breathe through a single, small device for a few moments. This new set of clinical vitals could enable the early diagnosis of many respiratory ailments, something that could have a large positive impact on disease prognosis and quality of life.</p>
