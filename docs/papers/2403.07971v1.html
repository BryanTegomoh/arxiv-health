                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an enhanced SEIR epidemiological model for COVID-19, integrating the dynamics of vaccine hesitancy (VH) and healthcare resource availability, which were previously overlooked. Through simulations based on public VH data, the study demonstrates that reducing VH, ensuring adequate critical healthcare resources, and implementing timely vaccination programs are paramount for improving health outcomes and minimizing fatalities during a pandemic.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is medically relevant as it provides a robust epidemiological modeling framework to predict and quantify how public attitudes towards vaccination and the availability of healthcare resources directly impact patient outcomes, hospitalizations, and fatalities during a pandemic, thus informing public health policies and clinical resource allocation strategies.</p>

                <p>Not explicitly an AI application. The paper utilizes mathematical compartmental models (SEIR) and simulations. However, the insights derived from this type of quantitative modeling are highly relevant for informing and integrating into AI-driven predictive analytics, decision support systems, and optimization algorithms used in public health (e.g., predicting disease spread, optimizing vaccine distribution) and healthcare resource management (e.g., bed allocation, staffing models).</p>

                    <p>The study employs an enhanced SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model, which is explicitly modified to incorporate dynamic factors such as vaccination status, vaccine hesitancy (VH), and critical healthcare resource availability.

                    <p>The core findings indicate that mitigating vaccine hesitancy significantly improves population health outcomes and reduces disease spread. Furthermore, the availability of sufficient critical healthcare resources is crucial for minimizing fatalities, and the prompt and efficient rollout of vaccination programs plays a life-saving role in controlling the epidemic's severity.</p>

                <p>The findings can directly inform public health campaigns by providing evidence for the critical need to counter vaccine hesitancy, thereby improving vaccination uptake. Clinically, it can help healthcare systems and policymakers forecast potential resource strains (e.g., hospital beds, intensive care units, ventilators) based on vaccination rates and public attitudes, enabling proactive resource allocation and strategic planning to minimize patient fatalities and improve clinical outcomes during future pandemics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant challenges in the allocation of vital healthcare resources. Existing epidemiological models, specifically compartmental models, aimed to predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on the population, but they overlooked the influence of \ac{VH} on disease dynamics, including the expected number of hospitalizations and fatalities. We propose improvements to the \ac{SEIR} model for COVID-19 by incorporating the influence of vaccination, \ac{VH}, and resource availability on the disease dynamics. We collect publicly available data and perform data analysis to capture \ac{VH} dynamic changes over time and develop scenario paths for \ac{VH}. We simulate the proposed compartmental model for each \ac{VH} path to explain the impacts of public attitudes toward vaccination, the impacts of healthcare resources on patient outcomes, and the timing of vaccination rollout on the progression and severity of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing \ac{VH} improves health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of addressing \ac{VH} to curb the spread of infectious diseases. Our results show that adequate levels of critical healthcare resources are crucial for minimizing fatalities and also highlight the life-saving impact of timely and effective vaccination programs.</p>
