                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an enhanced SEIR compartmental model for COVID-19, which uniquely integrates vaccine hesitancy (VH), vaccination rates, and resource availability to more accurately predict disease dynamics, hospitalizations, and fatalities. Through data analysis and scenario simulations, the study demonstrates that reducing VH, ensuring adequate critical healthcare resources, and implementing timely vaccination programs are pivotal for improving public health outcomes and minimizing fatalities during a pandemic.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a more comprehensive epidemiological modeling framework for public health officials to forecast disease burden by integrating behavioral factors like vaccine hesitancy with resource limitations. It offers actionable insights for pandemic preparedness, guiding resource allocation and targeted public health messaging to mitigate the impact of future outbreaks.</p>

                <p>Not explicitly medical AI. The paper utilizes computational epidemiological models (SEIR improvements) and simulations for predictive analysis and scenario planning in public health. While these methods are foundational for advanced computational health analytics and can inform AI-driven decision support systems, the described techniques themselves are mathematical modeling rather than what is typically classified as AI (e.g., machine learning, deep learning).</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed an enhanced Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model specifically for COVID-19. This model was improved by integrating parameters representing vaccination rates, the influence of vaccine hesitancy (VH), and the availability of critical healthcare resources. They collected and analyzed publicly available data to understand and characterize the dynamic changes in VH over time, which informed the creation of several VH scenario paths. The proposed compartmental model was then simulated across these different VH paths to analyze the effects of public attitudes, resource levels, and vaccination timing on the epidemic's progression and severity.</p>

                <p>This enhanced modeling tool can serve as a crucial decision-support system for healthcare administrators and public health agencies. It enables more accurate predictions of hospital demand (e.g., ICU beds, ventilators), facilitates proactive planning for resource allocation, and informs the development of targeted public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy. By quantifying the impact of behavioral factors and resource limitations, it can optimize vaccine rollout strategies and overall pandemic response to save lives and mitigate healthcare system strain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant challenges in the allocation of vital healthcare resources. Existing epidemiological models, specifically compartmental models, aimed to predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on the population, but they overlooked the influence of \ac{VH} on disease dynamics, including the expected number of hospitalizations and fatalities. We propose improvements to the \ac{SEIR} model for COVID-19 by incorporating the influence of vaccination, \ac{VH}, and resource availability on the disease dynamics. We collect publicly available data and perform data analysis to capture \ac{VH} dynamic changes over time and develop scenario paths for \ac{VH}. We simulate the proposed compartmental model for each \ac{VH} path to explain the impacts of public attitudes toward vaccination, the impacts of healthcare resources on patient outcomes, and the timing of vaccination rollout on the progression and severity of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing \ac{VH} improves health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of addressing \ac{VH} to curb the spread of infectious diseases. Our results show that adequate levels of critical healthcare resources are crucial for minimizing fatalities and also highlight the life-saving impact of timely and effective vaccination programs.</p>
