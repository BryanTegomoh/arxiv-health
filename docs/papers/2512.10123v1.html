                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Model-Guided Neural Network (MGNN) method to address the challenges of inverse medium scattering, particularly in highly nonlinear regimes where traditional machine learning struggles to incorporate explicit physics. The method integrates a differentiable forward solver directly into an ML framework and employs a progressive, multi-frequency approach to refine reconstructions. Empirically, it achieves high-quality imaging with significantly lower computational and sampling costs compared to existing techniques.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Inverse medium scattering is an ill-posed, nonlinear wave-based imaging problem arising in medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches.</p>
