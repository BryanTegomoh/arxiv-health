                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an "immunometabolic gatekeeping" framework, positing that a host tissue's intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity are upstream determinants of anti-tumor immunity and cancer vulnerability, rather than solely tumor-intrinsic factors. It integrates evidence from human cancers and cross-species comparisons to reconcile several paradoxes, arguing that metabolically intense tissues create immune-exhausting niches even before malignant transformation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work provides a novel, integrative understanding of cancer vulnerability by shifting focus from tumor-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, offering a crucial paradigm shift for cancer prevention, risk stratification, and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies that consider the host metabolic environment.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the abstract doesn't explicitly mention AI, the integration of 'human single-cell expression data' and the goal of 'identifying high-risk patients' present significant opportunities for AI applications. AI could be used to analyze complex multi-omic data to identify immunometabolic signatures, predict patient risk, stratify patients for targeted therapies, and design personalized metabolic-immune combination strategies. AI could also assist in drug discovery for metabolic modulators or immunotherapeutic agents based on the proposed 'immunometabolic gatekeeping' framework.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.</p>
