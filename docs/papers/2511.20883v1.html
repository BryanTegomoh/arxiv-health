                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the 'immunometabolic gatekeeping' framework, proposing that a tissue's intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity are upstream determinants of anti-tumour immunity, influencing whether immune infiltration translates into effective function. It reconciles several paradoxes, including Peto's paradox and the T-cell infiltration prognostic paradox, by positing that high-metabolism tissues with poor waste clearance create immune-exhausting niches even before malignant transformation. This framework shifts focus from tumor-intrinsic mutations to host tissue metabolism as a critical factor in cancer vulnerability and immune failure.</p>

                    <li>**Human Cancer Observations:** Tumors arising in high-metabolism tissues (e.g., kidney, brain, eye) exhibit high T-cell infiltration but are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments undermine immune function.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Cross-Species Validation:** Large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox).

                    <p>The intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity of healthy tissues function as an 'immunometabolic gatekeeper,' critically determining the efficacy of anti-tumour immunity. High-metabolism tissues in humans show high T-cell infiltration but poor cancer prognosis, paralleled by cross-species observations (Peto's paradox). This indicates that metabolically intense environments with poor waste clearance create immune-exhausting niches even before malignancy, unifying several long-standing paradoxes in cancer biology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.</p>
