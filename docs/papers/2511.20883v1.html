                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes an "immunometabolic gatekeeping" framework, asserting that the inherent metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity of healthy tissues are upstream determinants of anti-tumor immunity and cancer vulnerability. It posits that high-metabolism tissues with poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before malignant transformation, thus reconciling several paradoxes in cancer biology.</p>

                <p>The abstract mentions the use of 'human single-cell expression data' which is a type of high-dimensional data that could potentially be analyzed and interpreted with AI/machine learning models to identify biomarkers for high-risk patients or predict responses to metabolic-immune combination strategies.

                    <li>The core hypothesis is that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper for anti-tumor immunity, dictating effective immune function and tissue protection from tumorigenesis.</li>
                    
                    <li>Analysis of human cancers reveals that tumors in high-metabolism tissues (e.g., kidney, brain, eye) often show high T-cell infiltration but are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments undermine immune function.</li>
                    
                    <li>Cross-species comparisons support the framework: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates exhibit lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats resist cancer via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic byproduct accumulation.</li>
                    
                    <li>The 'immunometabolic gatekeeping' framework suggests that tissues with high metabolic rates and inefficient waste clearance predispose to immune-exhausting microenvironments prior to malignant transformation.</li>
                    
                    <li>This unifying framework provides a coherent explanation for multiple cancer biology paradoxes, including Peto's paradox, the T-cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities in cancer.</li>
                    
                    <li>The research advocates for a shift in focus from tumor-intrinsic genetic mutations to the host-tissue metabolic environment as a critical determinant of cancer vulnerability and immune failure.</li>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.</p>
