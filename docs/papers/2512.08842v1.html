                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research developed a temperature-driven multi-patch Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model to simulate *Culex* mosquito dynamics and evaluate vector control interventions in a spatially heterogeneous environment. Integrating real-world entomological data, weather factors, and local abatement practices, the study found that models neglecting spatial connectivity can significantly misrepresent intervention effectiveness and vector persistence. The findings provide critical insights for optimizing control strategies to mitigate mosquito-borne disease risk.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This paper is crucial for public health by providing a data-driven framework to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control programs, directly impacting the prevention and mitigation of mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile Virus transmitted by *Culex* species.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper utilizes mathematical modeling (multi-patch ODE model) and numerical simulations to analyze and optimize vector control strategies. While it does not explicitly state the use of AI/Machine Learning techniques, the computational framework and the goal of optimizing interventions for disease risk mitigation are highly amenable to AI applications. For instance, AI could be used to build more sophisticated predictive models for mosquito populations, optimize resource allocation for control efforts, or predict disease outbreaks based on environmental and intervention data.</p>

                <p>This research directly informs public health professionals and abatement districts on how to design more effective and spatially optimized vector control strategies. By understanding the critical role of spatial connectivity and dispersal, interventions (e.g., larvicide and adulticide applications) can be timed and targeted more precisely, potentially reducing *Culex* mosquito populations, minimizing human exposure to mosquito-borne pathogens, and ultimately decreasing the incidence of diseases such as West Nile Virus.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent mosquito-borne outbreaks have revealed vulnerabilities in our abatement programmes, raising concerns about how abatement-districts should choose optimal future control strategies. Spatial dissemination of vector-borne disease is strongly shaped by the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, creating substantial overlap between vector activity and pathogen spread. We developed a mathematical model for Culex mosquito dynamics in a patchy landscape, integrating entomological observations, weather-driven factors, and the vector control practices of the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (NWMAD) in Cook County, Illinois. By coupling a temperature-driven multi-patch ODE model with NWMAD's adulticide and larvicide interventions, we investigated how spatial heterogeneity and control timing influence mosquito abundance. We also evaluated how mosquito dispersal modifies intervention effectiveness by comparing single-patch and two-patch model outcomes. Our results showed that models ignoring spatial connectivity can substantially overestimate the impact of interventions or misidentify the thresholds of vector persistence. Through numerical simulations, we analysed continuous and pulsatile control approaches under varying spatial and temporal configurations. These findings provide insight into optimal strategies for managing Culex populations and mitigating mosquito-borne disease risk in weather-driven, spatially connected environments across Cook County, Illinois.</p>
