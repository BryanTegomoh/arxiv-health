                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to
model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often
falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise
thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML)
present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural
networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse
applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on
force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an
arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy
comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network
(GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network
(LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the
derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can
be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of
approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions
with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while
offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for
future applications in drug discovery.</p>
