                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-view 3D reconstruction that unifies geometry and appearance optimization, addressing the common issue of decoupling these aspects in existing methods. It proposes a Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering approach to simultaneously optimize mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors, achieving high-quality 3D reconstructions suitable for downstream editing tasks. The core contribution lies in its joint optimization strategy, which improves the fidelity and editability of 3D models.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI/Computer Vision method can be applied to create highly accurate and editable 3D models of human anatomy (from medical scans or external body scans). These models can then be utilized for patient-specific diagnosis, pre-operative planning and simulation (e.g., simulating surgical cuts or tissue deformation), designing custom medical devices, and developing interactive AR/VR systems for surgical training or patient education. The ability to perform 'relighting and shape deformation' is particularly valuable for simulating physiological changes, predicting tissue response during surgery, or personalizing prosthetic designs.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed methodology centers on a novel Gaussian-mesh joint optimization framework. It integrates 'Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering' to simultaneously optimize both the geometric structure (vertex positions and faces) and the textural appearance (vertex colors) of a 3D mesh. This joint optimization is guided by two primary cues: photometric consistency, ensuring the rendered model matches the input multi-view images, and geometric regularization, utilizing information from normal and depth maps to maintain structural integrity and realism.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.</p>
