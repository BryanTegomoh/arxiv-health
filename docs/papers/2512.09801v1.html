                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework for brain tumor segmentation, specifically addressing challenges in integrating complementary information from various MRI modalities despite semantic discrepancies and misalignment. The proposed method utilizes a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen unique features within each modality and a Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module for adaptive cross-modal knowledge exchange. Experiments on the BraTS 2019 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Dice and Sensitivity scores over existing baselines, particularly in scenarios with scarce labeled data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p>
