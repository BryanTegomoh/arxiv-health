                    <p>The study employs a deep learning approach based on the Res-Unet architecture for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions. The model was trained on multi-sequence MRI data (T1, T2, DWI, FLAIR) from the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset. To assess the impact of transfer learning, the model was trained twice: once with pre-existing weights and once without. A Majority Voting Classifier was finally integrated to combine segmentation results from different anatomical axes, yielding a comprehensive 3D segmentation. Performance was evaluated using the Dice score and sensitivity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The accurate understanding of ischemic stroke lesions is critical for
efficient therapy and prognosis of stroke patients. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method
for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is
tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical
image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However,
previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture
the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In
this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically
segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including
T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated
on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model
using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and
then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics,
including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes.
Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes
from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method. Our efforts
culminated in achieving a Dice score of 80.5\% and an accuracy of 74.03\%,
showcasing the efficacy of our segmentation approach.</p>
