                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a novel paradigm designed to overcome inherent limitations of LLMs in complex clinical antimicrobial therapy, such as knowledge gaps, privacy concerns, high costs, and limited reasoning. KRAL achieves this by distilling teacher-model reasoning, employing semi-supervised data augmentation, and utilizing agentic reinforcement learning. It significantly outperforms traditional RAG and SFT methods in both knowledge question-answering and reasoning capabilities at a fraction of the training cost, enabling safe and effective local LLM deployment in clinical decision support.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p>
