                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study performed the first comprehensive benchmarking of CNN, Vision Transformer, and State-Space Mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs using the DC1000 dataset. Contrary to the growing trend towards complex attention-based models, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net significantly outperformed all Transformer and Mamba variants, achieving the highest segmentation metrics. These findings underscore that architecture-task alignment and domain-specific considerations are more critical than model complexity for effective medical image segmentation, particularly with limited data.</p>

                    <p>The study performed a comprehensive benchmarking experiment comparing twelve state-of-the-art deep learning architectures from three distinct families: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and State-Space Mamba models.

Performance was quantitatively evaluated using standard segmentation metrics including Dice coefficient, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and precision.</p>

                    <p>The CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest segmentation accuracy for dental caries, with a Dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145. Notably, the top three performing architectures across all metrics were CNN-based, consistently outperforming all Vision Transformer and State-Space Mamba variants. The underperformance of Transformers and Mambas was attributed to their weaker spatial priors and requirements for larger datasets, making them less suitable than CNNs for this particular medical imaging task with the given data.</p>

                <p>This research provides critical insights for clinicians and developers in selecting appropriate AI models for dental imaging, potentially leading to the deployment of more accurate and reliable automated diagnostic tools. By validating the superior performance of CNNs for dental caries segmentation, it can accelerate the integration of AI into routine dental practice, enhancing the early detection of caries, improving treatment planning precision, and ultimately contributing to better patient care and oral health outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract points to the underperformance of Transformer and Mamba models being due to factors such as limited annotated data and weaker inherent spatial priors. This implies a limitation of these complex architectures when applied to domain-specific medical imaging tasks, especially where data availability is constrained and strong spatial inductive biases are beneficial. The findings are specific to panoramic radiographs and the DC1000 dataset, potentially limiting immediate generalizability to other imaging modalities or larger, more diverse datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate identification and segmentation of dental caries in panoramic radiographs are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.
