                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Cost-Aware Prediction (CAP), a novel framework that integrates machine learning (ML) models with cost-benefit analysis, enhanced by Large Language Model (LLM) agents, to provide transparent and interpretable decision support for heart failure mortality prediction. It leverages Clinical Impact Projection (CIP) curves for population-level cost visualization and LLM agents for generating patient-specific cost-benefit descriptions, aiming to explicitly communicate value trade-offs in clinical practice. The system was developed using an XGBoost model predicting 1-year mortality in heart failure patients and was well-received by clinicians for its decision support value.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved developing an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model on a dataset of 30,021 heart failure patients to predict 1-year mortality. This ML output was then integrated into the Cost-Aware Prediction (CAP) framework. Within CAP, Clinical Impact Projection (CIP) curves were generated to provide a population-level visualization of cost dimensions, including quality of life and healthcare provider expenses (further divided into treatment and error costs), across various decision thresholds. Additionally, four distinct Large Language Model (LLM) agents were employed to synthesize ML predictions with cost-benefit analysis, generating patient-specific textual descriptions. The entire system was subsequently evaluated by clinicians for its effectiveness as a decision support tool.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The XGBoost model demonstrated robust performance in predicting 1-year heart failure mortality, with an AUROC of 0.804 (95% CI 0.792-0.816), AUPRC of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558), and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). The CAP framework, leveraging CIP curves for population-level cost overviews and LLM agents for individualized cost-benefit analyses, was well-received by clinicians.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The CAP system offers a significant clinical impact by moving towards more holistic and transparent ML-based decision support. By explicitly quantifying and communicating the clinical consequences, cost-benefit trade-offs (including financial and quality of life aspects), and error costs associated with predictions, it empowers clinicians to make more ethically sound and economically responsible decisions. This is particularly valuable in contexts like determining eligibility for home care in heart failure patients, where resource allocation and individualized patient outcomes are paramount. It increases the interpretability and trustworthiness of ML predictions in real-world clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>A primary limitation noted through clinician feedback was the need to enhance the technical accuracy of the LLM agents, particularly when tasked with generating descriptions or analyses for more speculative clinical scenarios. This suggests that while LLMs are effective for summarizing and structuring information, their reasoning capabilities for complex, hypothetical clinical tasks may still require improvement.</p>

                <p>Future research should focus on improving the technical accuracy and reliability of the LLM agents, especially for tasks involving speculative clinical reasoning and nuanced scenario generation. Further work could also explore the generalizability of the CAP framework to a broader range of medical conditions and expand the granularity and scope of cost and benefit parameters considered in the analysis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objective: Machine learning (ML) predictive models are often developed without considering downstream value trade-offs and clinical interpretability. This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.</p>
