                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper provides an introduction to statistical inference for infectious diseases, beginning with the general stochastic epidemic model. It details methods for inferring crucial model parameters, such as the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and vaccination coverage ($v_c$), utilizing various data types from outbreaks, including final outcomes, temporal series, or observations from ongoing events. The discussion also encompasses complexities like individual heterogeneities and heterogeneous mixing, alongside an overview of statistical techniques for parameter estimation and models for early outbreak detection in surveillance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate statistical inference for infectious diseases is vital for public health, enabling precise estimation of disease transmissibility and intervention effectiveness. This knowledge directly informs strategies for outbreak control, vaccination campaigns, and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of epidemics.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper describes 'statistical models' rather than explicitly 'AI' or 'Machine Learning' models, the methodologies for parameter estimation and early outbreak detection using these models are foundational. These statistical inference techniques are frequently integrated into or serve as the basis for developing AI/ML models in epidemiological surveillance, predictive modeling of disease spread, and public health informatics for automated detection and forecasting.</p>

                    <p>As an introductory review, the paper's key 'findings' are its comprehensive synthesis of methodologies. It establishes a foundational understanding of stochastic epidemic models, demonstrates diverse statistical inference techniques adaptable to different data scenarios, emphasizes the necessity of accounting for biological and social complexities (like heterogeneities), and highlights the utility of specific statistical models for real-time disease surveillance and early warning systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this paper we first introduce the general stochastic epidemic model for the spread of infectious diseases. Then we give methods for inferring model parameters such as the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and vaccination coverage $v_c$ assuming different types of data from an outbreak such as final outbreak details and temporal data or observations from an ongoing outbreak. Both individual heterogeneities and heterogeneous mixing are discussed. We also provide an overview of statistical methods to perform parameter estimation for stochastic epidemic models. In the last section we describe the problem of early outbreak detection in infectious disease surveillance and statistical models used for this purpose.</p>
