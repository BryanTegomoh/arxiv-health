                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper describes a mathematical model rather than an AI model, the methodologies for data-validated host-parasite modeling, parameter estimation, and sensitivity analysis of infectious disease dynamics are foundational. These principles and models are critical components for developing AI/ML-driven epidemiological forecasting tools, predicting outbreak severity and timing, optimizing intervention strategies, and understanding complex host-pathogen interactions in real-world public health scenarios.</p>

                <p>The abstract implicitly suggests limitations by noting future directions; specifically, the current model may lack explicit incorporation of heterogeneity in host resistance, and its direct applicability has thus far been demonstrated only in a specific fish ectoparasite system.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The use of model experimental systems and mathematical models is important to further understanding of infectious disease dynamics and strategize disease mitigation. Gyrodactylids are helminth ectoparasites of teleost fish which have many dynamical characteristics of microparasites but offer the advantage that they can be quantified and tracked over time, allowing further insight into within-host and epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we design a model to describe host-parasite dynamics of the well-studied guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system, using experimental data to estimate parameters and validate it. We estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0), for this system. Sensitivity analysis reveals that parasite growth rate, and the rate at which the guppy mounts an immune response have the greatest impact on outbreak peak and timing both for initial outbreaks and on longer time scales. These findings highlight guppy population resistance and parasite virulence as key factors in disease control, and future work should focus on incorporating heterogeneity in host resistance into disease models and extrapolating to other host-parasite systems.</p>
