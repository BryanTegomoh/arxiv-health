                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops and validates a mathematical host-parasite model using experimental data from the guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system to understand infectious disease dynamics. The model estimates the basic reproduction number (R_0) and identifies parasite growth rate and host immune response as critical factors influencing outbreak peak and timing. These findings underscore the importance of host resistance and parasite virulence in disease control strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The use of model experimental systems and mathematical models is important to further understanding of infectious disease dynamics and strategize disease mitigation. Gyrodactylids are helminth ectoparasites of teleost fish which have many dynamical characteristics of microparasites but offer the advantage that they can be quantified and tracked over time, allowing further insight into within-host and epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we design a model to describe host-parasite dynamics of the well-studied guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system, using experimental data to estimate parameters and validate it. We estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0), for this system. Sensitivity analysis reveals that parasite growth rate, and the rate at which the guppy mounts an immune response have the greatest impact on outbreak peak and timing both for initial outbreaks and on longer time scales. These findings highlight guppy population resistance and parasite virulence as key factors in disease control, and future work should focus on incorporating heterogeneity in host resistance into disease models and extrapolating to other host-parasite systems.</p>
