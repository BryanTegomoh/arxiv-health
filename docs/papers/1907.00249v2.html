                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops a data-validated mathematical model for host-parasite dynamics using the guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system, a quantifiable model for infectious diseases. It estimates the basic reproduction number (R0) for this system and identifies parasite growth rate and host immune response rate as critical factors influencing outbreak peak and timing. These findings highlight the importance of host resistance and parasite virulence in disease control strategies.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>While focused on a specific aquatic model, the identified key factors (parasite growth rate/virulence and host immune response) are universal principles in infectious disease. These insights provide a foundational understanding for developing more effective disease control strategies in clinical and public health settings, by informing interventions that target pathogen replication rates or enhance host immunity to either prevent outbreaks or mitigate their severity.</p>

                <p>The primary limitation noted, implicitly, is the focus on a specific experimental model system (guppy-Gyrodactylus), which may not fully encompass the biological complexity of all host-parasite interactions. The abstract also suggests a current limitation in not yet incorporating heterogeneity in host resistance into the developed models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The use of model experimental systems and mathematical models is important to further understanding of infectious disease dynamics and strategize disease mitigation. Gyrodactylids are helminth ectoparasites of teleost fish which have many dynamical characteristics of microparasites but offer the advantage that they can be quantified and tracked over time, allowing further insight into within-host and epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we design a model to describe host-parasite dynamics of the well-studied guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system, using experimental data to estimate parameters and validate it. We estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0), for this system. Sensitivity analysis reveals that parasite growth rate, and the rate at which the guppy mounts an immune response have the greatest impact on outbreak peak and timing both for initial outbreaks and on longer time scales. These findings highlight guppy population resistance and parasite virulence as key factors in disease control, and future work should focus on incorporating heterogeneity in host resistance into disease models and extrapolating to other host-parasite systems.</p>
