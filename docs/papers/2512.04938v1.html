                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel method for continuous neurocognitive monitoring in rare neurological diseases, utilizing smartphone speech analysis combined with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. A proof-of-concept in Phenylketonuria (PKU) demonstrates that a speech-derived metric correlates significantly with a biochemical biomarker (blood phenylalanine) but not with standard cognitive tests, highlighting its potential for detecting subtle, overlooked cognitive changes. The system aims to provide predictive alerts weeks before patient decompensation by integrating heterogeneous medical data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it offers a non-invasive, continuous, and potentially objective method to monitor subtle cognitive decline ('brain fog') in rare neurological diseases, which current standard tests fail to capture. This could lead to earlier detection of decompensation, personalized interventions, and improved quality of life for patients.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using Speech AI integrated with Relational Graph Transformers (RELGT) for continuous neurocognitive monitoring. This system aims to analyze smartphone speech to detect subtle cognitive changes ('brain fog') that traditional tests miss, integrate heterogeneous medical data (speech, lab results, assessments), and provide predictive alerts for neurological decompensation, ultimately enabling personalized and proactive patient management.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed methodology involves collecting speech data via smartphones and analyzing it using Speech AI to derive metrics like 'Proficiency in Verbal Discourse.' These speech-derived metrics are then integrated with other heterogeneous medical data, such as laboratory results (e.g., blood phenylalanine) and traditional cognitive assessment scores, within a Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architecture. This RELGT model is designed to identify complex relationships and patterns across these diverse data types to enable continuous monitoring and predictive analysis. A proof-of-concept was demonstrated in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU).</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study's primary findings from a PKU proof-of-concept indicate that a speech-derived metric, 'Proficiency in Verbal Discourse,' correlates significantly and negatively (r = -0.50, p < 0.005) with blood phenylalanine levels. Importantly, this speech-derived metric showed no significant correlation with scores from standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35), suggesting it captures subtle cognitive symptoms ('brain fog') that traditional assessments miss.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This approach has the potential to revolutionize neurological care by shifting from episodic evaluations to continuous, personalized neurocognitive monitoring. It could enable the provision of predictive alerts weeks before clinical decompensation, allowing for timely therapeutic adjustments and interventions. By detecting subtle cognitive changes currently invisible to standard tests, it offers a novel, objective biomarker for disease progression and treatment efficacy, thereby enhancing patient management and quality of life for millions globally.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Patients with rare neurological diseases report cognitive symptoms -"brain fog"- invisible to traditional tests. We propose continuous neurocognitive monitoring via smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. Proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) shows speech-derived "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse" correlates with blood phenylalanine (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35). RELGT could overcome information bottlenecks in heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments), enabling predictive alerts weeks before decompensation. Key challenges: multi-disease validation, clinical workflow integration, equitable multilingual deployment. Success would transform episodic neurology into continuous personalized monitoring for millions globally.</p>
