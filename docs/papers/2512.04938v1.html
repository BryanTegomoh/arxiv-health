                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel approach for continuous neurocognitive monitoring in patients with rare neurological diseases, particularly focusing on subtle cognitive symptoms like "brain fog" often missed by traditional tests. It integrates smartphone-based speech AI for analyzing verbal discourse proficiency with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures to process diverse medical data. A proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) demonstrates that a speech-derived metric correlates significantly with a biochemical marker (blood phenylalanine) but not with standard cognitive assessments, suggesting its potential as an early, sensitive digital biomarker.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it offers a non-invasive, continuous, and potentially early detection method for cognitive decline in rare neurological diseases, addressing a critical gap in current diagnostic and monitoring practices. By leveraging readily available technology, it could significantly improve patient outcomes through timely intervention and personalized management.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a system for continuous neurocognitive monitoring, leveraging smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformers. It aims to detect subtle cognitive changes ('brain fog') in patients with rare neurological diseases, correlate them with medical biomarkers (e.g., blood phenylalanine), integrate various medical data types (speech, labs, assessments), and provide predictive alerts for patient decompensation weeks in advance. This could transform episodic neurological care into continuous, personalized monitoring.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves analyzing smartphone-derived speech to extract metrics like 'Proficiency in Verbal Discourse.' For the proof-of-concept, these speech metrics were correlated with biochemical markers (blood phenylalanine) and results from standard cognitive tests in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU). The proposed future architecture integrates these speech analytics with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) models to handle and synthesize heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments) for continuous predictive monitoring.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding from the proof-of-concept study in PKU patients is that the speech-derived 'Proficiency in Verbal Discourse' inversely correlates significantly with blood phenylalanine levels (p = -0.50, p < 0.005). Notably, this novel speech metric did not correlate with scores from traditional cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35), suggesting it captures unique cognitive information relevant to disease state that current standard assessments miss.</p>

This approach could enable early detection of subtle cognitive decline ('brain fog'), facilitate predictive alerts weeks before clinical decompensation, and allow for proactive, personalized therapeutic adjustments. Such a system could significantly improve the quality of life and management for patients with rare neurological diseases globally.</p>
