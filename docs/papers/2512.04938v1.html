                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel method for continuous neurocognitive monitoring in rare neurological diseases by integrating smartphone-based speech AI with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. A proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) demonstrated that a speech-derived metric, "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse," significantly correlates with blood phenylalanine levels (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not with traditional cognitive tests, suggesting its unique ability to capture subtle cognitive changes. The ultimate goal is to enable predictive alerts for cognitive decompensation weeks in advance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it offers a non-invasive, accessible, and potentially more sensitive method for continuous neurocognitive monitoring in rare neurological diseases, enabling early detection of subtle cognitive decline ('brain fog') often missed by current tests, thus facilitating timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is continuous neurocognitive monitoring using smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformers (RELGT). This system processes speech and other heterogeneous medical data (labs, assessments) to detect subtle cognitive changes, correlate them with biomarkers, and provide predictive alerts for potential clinical decompensation in patients with rare neurological diseases, thereby transforming episodic care into continuous personalized monitoring.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes a system for continuous neurocognitive monitoring using smartphone-based speech analysis. It provides a proof-of-concept by applying this approach to Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, where a speech-derived metric ('Proficiency in Verbal Discourse') was correlated with blood phenylalanine levels and standard cognitive test scores. The broader system design integrates these speech AI components with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures to process diverse, heterogeneous medical data.</p>

                    <p>In a proof-of-concept within PKU, a speech-derived metric, 'Proficiency in Verbal Discourse,' significantly correlated with blood phenylalanine levels (p = -0.50, p < 0.005), indicating its ability to reflect metabolic control impacting cognitive function. Notably, this speech metric showed no significant correlation with standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35), highlighting its unique contribution to capturing specific aspects of neurocognitive status.</p>

                <p>This technology holds the potential to transform neurological care by providing continuous, personalized neurocognitive monitoring, moving beyond episodic assessments. It could enable predictive alerts weeks before cognitive decompensation, allowing clinicians to intervene earlier, optimize treatment strategies, and potentially mitigate the impact of 'brain fog' and cognitive decline in millions of patients with rare neurological diseases globally.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Patients with rare neurological diseases report cognitive symptoms -"brain fog"- invisible to traditional tests. We propose continuous neurocognitive monitoring via smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. Proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) shows speech-derived "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse" correlates with blood phenylalanine (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35). RELGT could overcome information bottlenecks in heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments), enabling predictive alerts weeks before decompensation. Key challenges: multi-disease validation, clinical workflow integration, equitable multilingual deployment. Success would transform episodic neurology into continuous personalized monitoring for millions globally.</p>
