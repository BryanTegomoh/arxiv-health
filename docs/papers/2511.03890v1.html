                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is
essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess
valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to
generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across
different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with
irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and
inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline
with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)
meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing
aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a
uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element
correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the
learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function
with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness
regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and
element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and
shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to
the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad
meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh
correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.</p>
