                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical issue of 'partial prototype collapse' in prototypical self-supervised learning (SSL), where multiple learned prototypes converge to identical representations, diminishing their utility for guiding diverse representation learning. The authors diagnose the collapse as a consequence of joint optimization between encoders and prototypes, which promotes shortcut learning. They propose a novel, fully decoupled training strategy that models prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated via an online EM-style procedure, independent of the encoder's loss, effectively eliminating collapse and leading to more diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Self-supervised learning is vital in medicine due to the scarcity and cost of labeled data. This work's ability to learn diverse and stable 'prototypes' (e.g., distinct disease subtypes, cell types, or patient cohorts) from large, unlabeled medical datasets can lead to more accurate diagnostic models, better patient stratification, and the discovery of novel biological insights.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The improved Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning method can lead to more accurate and robust AI models for medical image analysis (e.g., detecting anomalies in X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or segmenting organs/tumors), better feature extraction from digital pathology slides for cancer diagnosis, and enhanced representation learning from electronic health records for predictive analytics. This ultimately contributes to more effective diagnostic tools and personalized treatment strategies in healthcare.</p>

                <p>By enabling the learning of more robust, distinct, and interpretable 'archetypes' (prototypes) from vast amounts of unlabeled medical data, this research can significantly enhance the foundation for medical AI models. This could translate to more precise disease classification, early detection of subtle disease variations, improved patient risk stratification, and the potential for developing personalized treatment strategies based on finely differentiated patient subgroups, all without heavy reliance on expensive expert annotations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.</p>
