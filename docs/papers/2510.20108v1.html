                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper diagnoses prototype collapse in self-supervised learning (SSL) as a direct consequence of joint encoder-prototype optimization, which encourages redundant representations. It introduces a fully decoupled training strategy where prototypes are modeled as a Gaussian mixture updated via an online EM-style procedure, independent of the encoder's loss. This method effectively eliminates prototype collapse without regularization, yielding diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance, which is critical for robust medical AI.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves a novel 'fully decoupled training strategy.' Instead of co-optimizing encoders and prototypes, prototypes are modeled as a Gaussian mixture and updated iteratively using an online Expectation-Maximization (EM)-style algorithm, entirely independently from the encoder's loss function. This separation ensures that prototype evolution is driven by diversity and statistical modeling rather than encoder loss minimization, preventing shortcut learning.</p>

The proposed decoupled training strategy, by modeling prototypes as an independently updated Gaussian mixture, effectively eliminates this collapse, leading to consistently diverse prototypes and ultimately stronger performance on downstream tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.</p>
