                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) to address algorithmic bias in machine learning models used in healthcare, particularly focusing on disparities in cross-group risk rankings within survival analysis. Applied to breast cancer prognosis using SEER data, FASM substantially improves fairness and mitigates misranking across patient groups, while preserving discrimination performance comparable to fairness-unaware models. The approach demonstrates stable fairness improvements over a 10-year horizon, especially in the mid-term follow-up.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for medical equity as it directly confronts how AI/ML models can perpetuate or amplify health disparities. By ensuring fairness in survival predictions, FASM can prevent biased clinical decision-making, promote equitable care, and challenge biological essentialism reinforced by misranked risk assessments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.</p>
