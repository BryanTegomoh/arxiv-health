                    <p>The paper proposes a novel Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) approach. This method is specifically designed to address algorithmic bias by mitigating disparities in both intra-group (within a specific demographic group) and cross-group (between different demographic groups) risk rankings over time. It accounts for the unique complexities of survival analysis, such as censoring and time-varying risks. FASM was applied to real-world SEER breast cancer data for prognosis prediction, with time-stratified evaluations conducted over a 10-year horizon.</p>

                    <p>FASM substantially improved fairness in survival predictions for breast cancer patients, particularly in mitigating disparities in risk rankings. Crucially, these fairness gains were achieved while preserving discrimination performance comparable to traditional, fairness-unaware survival models. The model demonstrated stable fairness over a 10-year follow-up period, with the most significant improvements in fairness observed during the mid-term of patient follow-up.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.</p>
