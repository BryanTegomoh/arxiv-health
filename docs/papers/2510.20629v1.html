                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), an approach designed to mitigate algorithmic bias in survival prediction by addressing both intra-group and cross-group risk ranking disparities over time. Applied to SEER breast cancer prognosis data, FASM significantly enhances fairness without compromising discrimination performance, maintaining stable improvements over a 10-year horizon, particularly in the mid-term.</p>

                    <p>The authors propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) approach. FASM is specifically designed to mitigate algorithmic bias by explicitly addressing disparities in both intra-group and cross-group risk rankings over time in survival analysis.

                    <p>FASM substantially improves fairness metrics in survival prediction without compromising discrimination performance, which remains comparable to fairness-unaware models. This improved fairness is robust and stable over a 10-year follow-up period, with the greatest enhancements observed during the mid-term of patient follow-up.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.</p>
