                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the persistent problem of test overfitting in Automated Program Repair (APR), specifically examining its prevalence when Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to generate code fixes. The study experimentally assesses if LLM-based repairs pass known tests but fail on hidden, hold-out tests, utilizing repository-level SWE-bench tasks to determine how significant this issue remains today. It highlights the risk that an automated 'fix' might be brittle, ultimately being 'worse than the disease' by introducing subtle, undetected failures.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is profoundly relevant to medicine as software reliability is paramount in healthcare, from medical devices and electronic health records to AI diagnostics. If LLMs are deployed to generate or repair code for these critical systems, test overfitting could introduce hidden, life-threatening bugs, making the 'fix' itself a direct threat to patient safety and the integrity of medical data.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research addresses a foundational problem (test overfitting) relevant to the use of LLMs in the development, maintenance, and automated repair of software components for medical AI applications (e.g., diagnostic models, drug discovery platforms) and general healthcare IT systems. Mitigating overfitting is crucial for ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and safety of these AI-driven tools in healthcare.</p>

                    <li>The core problem investigated is test overfitting, where automated code repairs pass readily available tests but fail on unseen, hidden tests.</li>
                    
                    <li>The research specifically focuses on how modern Large Language Models (LLMs) used for Automated Program Repair (APR) exhibit this overfitting phenomenon.</li>
                    
                    <li>Methodology involves experimental evaluation using repository-level SWE-bench tasks, which represent complex, realistic software engineering challenges.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study aims to quantify the extent to which LLM-generated fixes are susceptible to superficial correctness that does not hold up under more comprehensive, hidden testing.</li>
                    
                    <li>It addresses a critical concern for software reliability: ensuring that AI-generated code corrections are robust and genuinely resolve issues without introducing new, hidden vulnerabilities.</li>
                    
                    <li>The paper's title metaphorically warns that an LLM's 'cure' (a code fix) could be 'worse than the disease' (the original bug) if it leads to unaddressed, deeper failures.</li>
                    
                    <li>Findings will significantly impact the trustworthiness and safe deployment of LLM-powered software development tools, particularly in safety-critical domains.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs an experimental approach to evaluate LLM-based Automated Program Repair systems. It utilizes repository-level SWE-bench tasks, which provide realistic software bugs within complex codebases. The researchers will apply LLMs to these tasks to generate code fixes and then rigorously evaluate these repairs by comparing their performance on a known set of tests against a hold-out set of hidden, more comprehensive tests. The incidence and characteristics of failures on hidden tests will quantify test overfitting.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding will be a quantitative assessment of the extent to which test overfitting persists as a problem in automated program repair when Large Language Models are utilized. The research will specifically reveal the frequency and nature of LLM-generated code fixes that successfully pass observed test suites but subsequently fail when subjected to hidden, repository-level SWE-bench tests, thereby establishing the current prevalence of this critical reliability issue.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact is potentially immense. Unreliable, overfit LLM-generated code in medical software could lead to undetected malfunctions in critical medical devices (e.g., pacemakers, MRI machines), erroneous diagnoses from AI systems, or vulnerabilities in electronic health records that only surface under specific, untested conditions. This research provides vital insights into the inherent risks of leveraging AI for software development in healthcare, directly influencing regulatory scrutiny, safety protocols, and the ethical deployment of such technologies to protect patient lives and maintain trust in digital health solutions.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While utilizing realistic SWE-bench tasks, the study's findings may be specific to the particular LLMs and repair methodologies employed, potentially limiting their generalizability across all evolving LLM architectures or diverse software ecosystems. The efficacy of the 'hidden tests' in comprehensively exposing all subtle forms of overfitting is also a critical factor and could influence the completeness of the findings.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research could focus on developing novel testing methodologies specifically designed to uncover overfitting in LLM-generated code, exploring new LLM architectures or training paradigms that inherently mitigate this issue. Further work might also include analyzing the long-term safety and economic implications of deploying LLM-repaired software in highly regulated, safety-critical sectors like healthcare, and expanding benchmarks to cover an even broader spectrum of real-world medical software complexities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated program repair has been shown to be susceptible to generating repaired code that passes on seen tests but fails on a hold-out set of hidden tests. This problem, dubbed test overfitting, has been identified and studied before the rise of large language models. We experimentally study how much test overfitting is still a problem today, using repository-level SWE-bench tasks.</p>
