                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a unified, self-contained theoretical framework for understanding diffusion models across general state spaces, integrating both continuous data (e.g., medical images) and discrete/categorical data (e.g., genomic sequences). By clarifying the foundational mathematics, connecting discrete-time to continuous-time limits, and deriving common variational treatments, it provides a comprehensive roadmap for applying these powerful generative AI tools to diverse medical and health research challenges.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Diffusion models are at the forefront of generative AI, with significant potential in medicine for tasks like realistic medical image synthesis (for data augmentation, privacy-preserving data sharing), de-novo drug discovery, protein design, and genomic sequence generation. This paper's unified, foundational approach makes these powerful models more accessible, robust, and adaptable for handling the inherently diverse, often mixed (continuous and discrete), and complex data found across healthcare and biomedical research.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The unified theoretical framework presented in this paper underpins the development of various medical AI applications using diffusion models. For continuous data, this includes generating synthetic medical images for data augmentation, privacy-preserving research, or image reconstruction/denoising. For discrete data, it enables applications such as designing novel drug molecules, proteins, or antibodies; generating realistic genetic or protein sequences for research; and creating synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) for privacy-conscious data sharing and model training. The fundamental insights from this paper contribute to making these medical AI applications more robust, efficient, and versatile across different types of healthcare data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Although diffusion models now occupy a central place in generative modeling, introductory treatments commonly assume Euclidean data and seldom clarify their connection to discrete-state analogues. This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.</p>
