                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper demonstrates that reinforcement learning (RL) with clinically grounded rewards significantly enhances the performance of medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Chest X-ray (CXR) report generation and visual grounding. By combining strong supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the RL-optimized RadVLM achieves state-of-the-art results. This positions clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs, even though explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") did not provide further improvements in this context.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involved three main phases: (1) Initial model development through large-scale Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) of a Qwen3-VL base model on Chest X-ray (CXR) data to create an updated RadVLM. (2) A subsequent cold-start SFT stage to imbue the model with basic explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") capabilities. (3) The application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using carefully designed, clinically grounded, task-specific rewards to further optimize the model for report generation and visual grounding tasks. Comparative experiments were run on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without the "thinking" component, under a unified evaluation pipeline.</p>

                    <p>Strong supervised fine-tuning is indispensable for establishing a high baseline performance in medical Vision-Language Models. Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically aligned rewards, provides substantial additional performance gains for both Chest X-ray report generation and visual grounding. Conversely, the incorporation of explicit intermediate reasoning or "thinking" did not yield further improvements in this specific medical VLM setting. The RL-optimized RadVLM models achieved state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming their SFT-only baseline counterparts.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to significantly enhance the clinical workflow in radiology. More accurate and clinically aligned AI-generated radiology reports can reduce the workload for radiologists, improve reporting consistency, and minimize errors. Furthermore, superior visual grounding can lead to more precise identification and localization of pathologies on Chest X-rays, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing missed findings, and facilitating earlier intervention, ultimately benefiting patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.</p>
