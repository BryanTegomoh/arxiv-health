                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an iterative post-deployment alignment framework using Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the safety and trustworthiness of healthcare AI assistants. Evaluating four LLMs on the CARES-18K benchmark, the framework achieved up to 42% improvement in harmful query detection, while highlighting critical trade-offs with erroneous refusals and architecture-dependent calibration biases.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized an iterative post-deployment alignment framework. This framework refines Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) against domain-specific safety signals. Four distinct LLM architectures (Llama-3B, Llama-8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) were evaluated over multiple alignment cycles using the CARES-18K benchmark, designed for adversarial robustness in healthcare. Ablation studies were conducted to compare the effectiveness and reliability of self-evaluation mechanisms against external or finetuned human judges for maximizing performance gains.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The alignment framework led to a substantial improvement in safety, with up to a 42% increase in harmful query detection. However, this safety gain presented trade-offs, often leading to an increase in erroneous refusals for benign queries. The research also revealed architecture-dependent calibration biases among the evaluated LLMs, indicating varying responses to alignment strategies. Furthermore, the study identified specific conditions for when self-evaluation mechanisms are reliable versus when external or finetuned judges are essential for achieving optimal alignment performance.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has significant clinical impact by providing a practical methodology to develop safer and more trustworthy conversational AI assistants for healthcare settings. By mitigating risks of unsafe medical advice and inappropriate query refusals, it can foster greater adoption of AI tools by clinicians and patients. This enhanced reliability can improve patient education, support symptom assessment, streamline administrative tasks, and ultimately contribute to safer and more efficient patient care within the medical ecosystem.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implicitly notes several limitations, including the observed 'interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals,' indicating that achieving perfect safety without impacting helpfulness remains a challenge. The finding of 'architecture-dependent calibration biases' suggests that the alignment framework's effectiveness may vary significantly across different LLM models, necessitating tailored approaches. Additionally, the identification of scenarios where 'external or finetuned judges are necessary' implies that fully automated and universally reliable alignment without human oversight is not yet achieved.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The paper underscores the importance of 'adopting best practices that balance patient safety, user trust, and clinical utility.' This suggests future research should focus on further refining these best practices, optimizing the delicate balance between safety and helpfulness, and potentially developing more robust, architecture-agnostic alignment strategies. Continued efforts to enhance self-evaluation mechanisms to reduce reliance on resource-intensive external or finetuned judges would also be a valuable future direction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare, yet ensuring their safety and trustworthiness remains a barrier to deployment. Conversational medical assistants must avoid unsafe compliance without over-refusing benign queries. We present an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that applies Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine models against domain-specific safety signals. Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases. We also perform ablation studies to identify when self-evaluation is reliable and when external or finetuned judges are necessary to maximize performance gains. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting best practices that balance patient safety, user trust, and clinical utility in the design of conversational medical assistants.</p>
