                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper challenges the conventional reliance on Word Error Rate (WER) for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in clinical dialogue, demonstrating its poor correlation with the actual clinical impact of transcription errors. To address this, the authors introduce and validate an LLM-as-a-Judge, optimized with GEPA, which effectively replicates expert clinical assessments of ASR transcription discrepancies, offering a scalable solution for safety-focused evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate medical documentation and communication are vital for patient safety and quality of care. ASR systems widely deployed in clinical settings must be evaluated based on their impact on clinical understanding, not just textual fidelity, to prevent misdiagnoses, medication errors, and other adverse events resulting from transcription errors.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper addresses the application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in healthcare for transcribing 'clinical dialogue' and 'patient-facing dialogue.' Furthermore, it introduces an 'LLM-as-a-Judge' (a Large Language Model acting as an evaluator) specifically optimized to 'replicate expert clinical assessment' of ASR transcription errors. This LLM serves as an AI tool for evaluating the 'clinical impact' and 'safety' of other AI systems (ASR) within healthcare, effectively an AI-driven quality assurance system for medical AI.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved two primary phases: 1) Gold-standard creation: Expert clinicians compared ground-truth patient-doctor dialogue utterances with ASR-generated counterparts from two distinct datasets, meticulously labeling the clinical impact (No, Minimal, or Significant) of any transcription discrepancies. 2) LLM-as-a-Judge development: An LLM (Gemini-2.5-Pro) was programmatically optimized using GEPA (a method likely for prompt engineering or fine-tuning) to replicate these expert clinical assessments. The performance of this optimized LLM was then validated against the human-labeled gold standard using accuracy and Cohen's Kappa.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.</p>
