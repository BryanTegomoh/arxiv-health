                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated pretreatment MRI descriptors in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer (BC) patients. It found that specific MRI features, particularly unifocality and non-spiculated margins, were independently associated with pCR and significantly enhanced the performance of machine learning models when combined with clinicobiological variables.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is medically relevant as it provides crucial insights into identifying breast cancer patients likely to achieve pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This predictive capability can personalize treatment strategies, avoid ineffective therapies, and optimize patient outcomes by considering alternative treatments for potential non-responders.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper uses Random Forest classifiers, a machine learning technique, to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients. Its clinical relevance statement explicitly states the goal to 'develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response' and 'optimizing treatment outcomes'. This is a direct application of AI (specifically machine learning) to enhance diagnostic prediction and guide therapeutic strategies in a medical context, moving towards personalized medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This was a retrospective observational single-center study conducted between 2016 and 2020, involving 129 breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had a pretherapeutic breast MRI. MR studies were standardized using BI-RADS descriptors and T2-weighted breast edema scores. Statistical analyses included univariable and multivariable logistic regression to assess variable associations with pCR. Random forest classifiers were developed on a 70% training split of the database and validated on the remaining 30% to predict pCR.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Pathological complete response was achieved in 46% (59/129) of patients, with higher rates in triple-negative (55%) and HER2+ (59%) subtypes. Clinical and biological factors significantly associated with pCR included BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005), and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p=0.016). Univariate analysis revealed that oval/round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (p=0.024), and a lower MRI size (p=0.031) were significant MRI predictors. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins independently predicted pCR in multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers increased sensitivity (0.67 vs 0.62), specificity (0.69 vs 0.67), and precision (0.71 vs 0.67) for pCR prediction.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This study demonstrates that specific, routinely available pretreatment MRI features, combined with clinicobiological data (including TILs), can significantly improve the prediction of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This multimodal approach could lead to the development of robust machine learning models to identify patients at high risk of non-response early in their treatment pathway, allowing clinicians to consider alternative or intensified therapeutic strategies, thereby optimizing individual patient outcomes and potentially reducing unnecessary exposure to ineffective treatments.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study's limitations include its retrospective and observational design, as well as its single-center nature, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader populations or other clinical settings. The sample size of 129 patients, while sufficient for initial associations, might benefit from larger multi-center validation cohorts for more robust machine learning model development.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on developing and validating multimodal machine learning models that integrate pretreatment MRI features with comprehensive clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, across larger, prospective, multi-center cohorts. These models could then be employed in clinical trials to prospectively identify patients at risk of non-response to NAC, guiding the personalized consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes</p>
