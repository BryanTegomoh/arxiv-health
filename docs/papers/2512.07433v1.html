                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces FairGHDC, a novel fairness-aware training framework for Graph Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) that aims to mitigate bias in graph-structured data. FairGHDC achieves this by incorporating a demographic-parity-based bias correction directly into the hypervector update process. The framework substantially reduces fairness gaps while maintaining high accuracy and offering a significant speedup in training time compared to traditional Graph Neural Networks.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>The development of robust, efficient, and *fair* AI models, particularly those that emulate brain-like computation on complex graph-structured data, is crucial for equitable and effective healthcare. This work directly addresses the critical issue of bias in such models, which could be applied to patient data, disease networks, or treatment prediction, ensuring that AI-driven medical decisions do not perpetuate or amplify existing health disparities across different demographic groups.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper doesn't present a specific medical AI application, its proposed bias mitigation framework, FairGHDC, is crucial for ensuring fairness in any potential medical AI system built using Graph Hyperdimensional Computing. For instance, if Graph HDC were used for tasks such as disease risk prediction based on patient graphs, drug discovery on molecular graphs, medical image analysis, or patient stratification for treatment, FairGHDC could prevent the system from perpetuating or amplifying biases against certain demographic groups, thereby promoting health equity and preventing unequal treatment in healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Graph hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for cognitive tasks, emulating brain-like computation with high-dimensional vectors known as hypervectors. While HDC offers robustness and efficiency on graph-structured data, its fairness implications remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study fairness in graph HDC, where biases in data representation and decision rules can lead to unequal treatment of different groups. We show how hypervector encoding and similarity-based classification can propagate or even amplify such biases, and we propose a fairness-aware training framework, FairGHDC, to mitigate them. FairGHDC introduces a bias correction term, derived from a gap-based demographic-parity regularizer, and converts it into a scalar fairness factor that scales the update of the class hypervector for the ground-truth label. This enables debiasing directly in the hypervector space without modifying the graph encoder or requiring backpropagation. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGHDC substantially reduces demographic-parity and equal-opportunity gaps while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard GNNs and fairness-aware GNNs. At the same time, FairGHDC preserves the computational advantages of HDC, achieving up to about one order of magnitude ($\approx 10\times$) speedup in training time on GPU compared to GNN and fairness-aware GNN baselines.</p>
