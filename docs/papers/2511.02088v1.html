                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study utilized in silico trials (ISTs) to model acute ischemic stroke (AIS) outcomes, quantifying the potential benefit of improved recanalization outcomes and shorter treatment times. It predicted a significant increase in functional independence for patients with full recanalization and early treatment, highlighting recanalization as more beneficial than faster treatment. This work establishes a novel proof-of-concept for ISTs as a tool to evaluate the maximum potential for improvement to patient outcomes, useful in early therapy development.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This study is crucial for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment as it offers a novel computational method to predict and quantify the maximal achievable improvements in patient functional outcomes.

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes 'in silico trials' (ISTs) which involve creating 'virtual patients' and 'in silico models of blood flow, perfusion, and tissue death' to predict patient functional independence. This represents a significant application of computational modeling and simulation in healthcare, which is a foundational aspect of medical AI. While not explicitly using terms like machine learning or deep learning, the methodology leverages advanced computational techniques for predictive modeling and simulating complex biological systems, which is critical for developing AI-driven personalized medicine, optimizing clinical trial design, and predicting treatment efficacy without extensive human trials.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study uses in silico trials (ISTs) to quantify the potential for benefit
due to improved recanalisation outcomes and shorter time to treatment for acute
ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients. We use an IST framework to run trials on
cohorts of virtual patients with early and late treatment after stroke onset,
and with successful (full) and unsuccessful (no) recanalisation outcomes. Using
a virtual population of AIS patients, and in silico models of blood flow,
perfusion, and tissue death, we predict the functional independence of each
patient at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
  Results predict 57% of the virtual population achieve functional independence
with full recanalisation and a treatment time of 4 hours or less, compared to
29% with no recanalisation and more than 4 hours to treatment. Successful
recanalisation was more beneficial than faster treatment: the best-case common
odds ratio (improved mRS) due to recanalisation was 2.7 compared to 1.6 for
early treatment.
  This study provides a proof-of-concept for a novel use-case of ISTs:
quantifying the maximum potential for improvement to patient outcomes. This
would be useful during early stages of therapy development, to determine the
target populations and therapy goal with the greatest potential for population
improvements.</p>
