                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">UniX introduces a novel unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation that overcomes the conflicting goals of these tasks by decoupling them into an autoregressive and a diffusion branch, respectively. It employs a crucial cross-modal self-attention mechanism to dynamically guide generation with understanding features. This architecture achieves significant improvements: 46.1% in understanding (Micro-F1) and 24.2% in generation (FD-RadDino) with high parameter efficiency, establishing a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image AI.</p>

                    <p>UniX utilizes a novel decoupled neural architecture comprising an autoregressive branch for visual understanding and a separate diffusion branch for high-fidelity image generation. A core innovation is the cross-modal self-attention mechanism, which enables dynamic guidance of the generative diffusion process by features extracted from the understanding branch. The model's training is further bolstered by a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, optimizing the synergistic collaboration between the distinct understanding and generation tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.
