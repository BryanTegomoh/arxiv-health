                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">UniX is a novel medical foundation model designed for chest X-ray understanding and generation, addressing the inherent conflict between semantic abstraction and pixel-level reconstruction tasks. It achieves this by decoupling the tasks into distinct autoregressive (understanding) and diffusion (generation) branches, synergistically linked by a cross-modal self-attention mechanism. This architecture, combined with rigorous data processing and multi-stage training, significantly improves both understanding and generation performance compared to prior unified models, establishing a scalable paradigm for medical imaging AI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.
