                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel, minimally invasive optical tweezers method combined with high-speed video microscopy to simultaneously quantify local membrane forces and displacements in single red blood cells. This technique allowed for the creation of a mechano-dynamic phase space, successfully differentiating metabolic and structural states based on unique fluctuation-force signatures. Key findings include that membrane softening enhances fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation, offering a robust framework for mapping active cellular mechanics and detecting biomechanical dysfunction.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a novel experimental methodology for characterizing cellular states based on 'fluctuation-force signatures' to 'differentiate between metabolic and structural states.' While such complex data analysis and classification tasks are amenable to machine learning or AI for automated diagnosis or biomarker identification, the research paper itself does not propose or utilize AI in its methodology or applications. Therefore, no direct AI health application is described within this research.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.</p>
