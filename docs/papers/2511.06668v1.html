                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates how contradictory medical evidence in source documents degrades Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance in healthcare. It establishes a novel benchmark using Australian TGA consumer medicine information documents and temporally stratified PubMed abstracts to evaluate five LLMs. The study finds that contradictions between highly similar abstracts significantly reduce LLM consistency and factual accuracy, underscoring the necessity for advanced contradiction-aware filtering strategies in high-stakes domains.</p>

                    <p>The study involved three main steps: i) creating a benchmark dataset by converting headings from Australian TGA consumer medicine information documents into natural language questions; ii) retrieving PubMed abstracts for these questions, deliberately stratifying them by publication year to introduce temporal inconsistencies and potential contradictions; and iii) conducting a comparative analysis of five different LLMs to assess how they integrate and reconcile this temporally inconsistent information, evaluating the frequency and impact of contradictions on response consistency and factual accuracy.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that contradictions present in highly similar retrieved source documents significantly degrade the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. This degradation manifests as increased inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in the LLM-generated responses to medicine-related queries, indicating that current RAG mechanisms based solely on retrieval similarity are inadequate for reliable medical information synthesis.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Unreliable RAG systems in healthcare could lead to the dissemination of incorrect or outdated medical advice, potentially resulting in suboptimal treatment decisions, medication errors, or patient confusion. The findings underscore that for RAG to be safely deployed in clinical decision support, patient education, or drug information systems, robust mechanisms are essential to detect, reconcile, and present conflicting evidence accurately, thereby safeguarding patient outcomes and maintaining trust in AI-driven healthcare tools.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In high-stakes information domains such as healthcare, where large language
models (LLMs) can produce hallucinations or misinformation, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) has been proposed as a mitigation strategy, grounding model
outputs in external, domain-specific documents. Yet, this approach can
introduce errors when source documents contain outdated or contradictory
information. This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating
RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are
three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine
information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration
(TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the
retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple
publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated
evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of
outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how
LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings
show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade
performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model
answers. These results highlight that retrieval similarity alone is
insufficient for reliable medical RAG and underscore the need for
contradiction-aware filtering strategies to ensure trustworthy responses in
high-stakes domains.</p>
