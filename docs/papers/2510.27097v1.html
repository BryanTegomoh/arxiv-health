                <p>This methodology holds significant potential for enhancing the understanding and management of fertility and endometrial disorders. By pinpointing cell-type-specific molecular changes, it can facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for diagnostic purposes (e.g., identifying underlying causes of recurrent implantation failure or infertility) and the identification of therapeutic targets for conditions like endometriosis, Asherman's syndrome, or other endometrial dysfunctions. This could lead to more personalized and effective treatments in reproductive medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.</p>
