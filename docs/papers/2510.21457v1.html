                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces HINet, a novel method that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Domain Adversarial Training (DAT) to accurately estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings. HINet addresses two critical challenges: the often-unrealistic assumption of known exposure mappings, and the newly identified problem of network-level covariate shift arising from homophily and treatment assignment interactions. The approach demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets, providing robust treatment effect estimates under complex interference patterns.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and public health as many interventions and disease dynamics occur within interconnected networks (e.g., social networks influencing health behaviors, disease transmission networks, drug interaction networks). Accurately estimating treatment effects in such settings, accounting for direct and indirect influences, is crucial for designing effective public health policies, targeted clinical interventions, and understanding disease propagation.</p>

                <p>This research provides a foundational machine learning method that could power AI applications in health to: 1) More accurately estimate the causal impact of medical interventions (e.g., drugs, vaccines, behavioral therapies) in real-world populations where individuals influence each other. 2) Develop robust predictive models for health outcomes that account for complex social or biological networks and can generalize across different patient populations or clinical settings (mitigating covariate shift). 3) Optimize public health strategies by better understanding how interventions propagate through communities. 4) Inform personalized medicine by considering the patient's network context (e.g., family, social connections, comorbidity networks).</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>HINet combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Domain Adversarial Training (DAT). GNNs are utilized to capture the complex relational structure of the network and model interference effects, learning representations that encode both individual features and neighborhood information. DAT is then applied to these representations to create a 'domain-invariant' feature space, effectively mitigating network-level covariate shift induced by treatment assignment and homophily, thereby enabling robust and unbiased estimation of treatment effects.</p>

                    <p>HINet effectively estimates heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings, demonstrating robust performance even when the precise exposure mapping (how others' treatments affect an individual) is unknown. It successfully mitigates the impact of network-level covariate shift, a previously unaddressed challenge that can significantly bias causal estimates. Extensive empirical validation on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets confirms the superior accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This methodology can significantly improve the design and evaluation of health interventions, particularly in public health, by more accurately predicting the overall impact of treatments or campaigns that propagate through social or epidemiological networks. It enables better assessment of policies like vaccination drives or health education programs, by accounting for peer influence. Furthermore, it could refine drug efficacy assessments or adverse event prediction in patient cohorts where individuals' health outcomes are interdependent, leading to more targeted and effective clinical strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>
