                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ARC (Approach for identifying pRoxies of demographic Correction), a novel framework to identify explanatory factors for group-level differences in clinical equations, specifically addressing the debate around race-based adjustments. Applying ARC to spirometry tests across two large cohorts, the authors found that anthropometric measures like sitting height and waist circumference, rather than coarse sociodemographic factors, explain significant portions of observed lung function differences. The resulting $ARC_{PFT}$ equations, incorporating these factors, surpassed current race-neutral and race-stratified models in predictive performance and reduced vulnerability to domain shift.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a data-driven method to replace imprecise demographic proxies with more accurate biological or anthropometric factors in clinical equations, leading to improved diagnostic precision, reduced health disparities, and more personalized patient care in areas like pulmonary function assessment.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper introduces a 'framework to identify explanatory factors' and 'develop personalized clinical equations' that surpass existing predictive performance. While not explicitly using terms like 'machine learning' or 'deep learning,' the process of analyzing large observational cohorts (CDC NHANES, UK Biobank) to 'disentangle proxies' and construct robust 'equations' for improved predictive accuracy strongly aligns with applications of advanced statistical modeling and machine learning in health. This falls under medical AI in predictive analytics, precision medicine, and clinical decision support, where data-driven approaches are used to optimize clinical algorithms and personalize care.</p>

                    <p>The study employed the ARC framework to systematically identify explanatory factors for group-level differences in clinical measurements. It utilized two large observational cohorts (CDC NHANES and UK Biobank) comprising 159,893 participants for spirometry data. Statistical modeling was used to assess the contribution of various factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric like sitting height and waist circumference) to observed differences in lung function. New reference equations, $ARC_{PFT}$, were then developed incorporating these identified factors. Performance was evaluated by comparing $ARC_{PFT}$ against the GLI-Global race-neutral equation and race-stratified models using mean absolute error (MAE) across different racial/ethnic groups and for domain shift vulnerability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This approach offers a pathway to developing more accurate and precise clinical diagnostic tools, particularly for conditions assessed via spirometry, by moving away from coarse race-based adjustments towards physiologically relevant measures. This could lead to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases, reduced misclassification, and fewer health disparities. The ARC framework itself has the potential to be applied across diverse medical specialties, fostering the development of personalized clinical equations that improve patient outcomes by basing adjustments on individual biology rather than population-level demographic proxies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The use of coarse demographic adjustments in clinical equations has been increasingly scrutinized. In particular, adjustments for race have sparked significant debate with several medical professional societies recommending race-neutral equations in recent years. However, current approaches to remove race from clinical equations do not address the underlying causes of observed differences. Here, we present ARC (Approach for identifying pRoxies of demographic Correction), a framework to identify explanatory factors of group-level differences, which may inform the development of more accurate and precise clinical equations. We apply ARC to spirometry tests across two observational cohorts, CDC NHANES and UK Biobank, comprising 159,893 participants. Cross-sectional sociodemographic or exposure measures did not explain differences in reference lung function across race groups beyond those already explained by age, sex, and height. By contrast, sitting height accounted for up to 26% of the remaining differences in lung volumes between healthy Black and White adults. We then demonstrate how pulmonary function test (PFT) reference equations can incorporate these factors in a new set of equations called $ARC_{PFT}$, surpassing the predictive performance of the race-neutral GLI-Global equation recommended by major pulmonary societies. When compared to GLI-Global, inclusion of sitting height and waist circumference in $ARC_{PFT}$ decreased mean absolute error by 13% among Black participants in the UK Biobank and by 24% in NHANES. $ARC_{PFT}$ also had reduced vulnerability to domain shift compared to race-based methods, with mean absolute error 19.3% and 35.6% lower than race-stratified models in out-of-sample Asian and Hispanic populations, respectively. This approach provides a path for understanding the proxies of imprecise demographic adjustments and developing personalized clinical equations.</p>
