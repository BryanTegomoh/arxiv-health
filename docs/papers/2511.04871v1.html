                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Clinical-ComBAT, a novel harmonization method for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data, specifically designed to address scanner-specific biases in real-world clinical applications. It overcomes the limitations of existing methods like ComBAT by enabling independent, non-linear harmonization of sites, making multi-site data more reliable for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and white matter properties. The method demonstrates improved alignment of diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling on simulated and real data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.</p>
