                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves 'generative joint diffusion modeling.' Instead of learning conditional distributions for specific tasks, MetaVoxel learns a single diffusion process that captures the joint probability distribution across both high-dimensional imaging data (T1-weighted MRI) and various clinical metadata (e.g., age, sex). This allows it to perform diverse tasks by inverting or sampling from this learned joint distribution.</p>

Crucially, its performance across these tasks is comparable to specialized, task-specific baseline models. Furthermore, the model demonstrates robust capabilities for flexible, zero-shot inference using varying input subsets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.</p>
