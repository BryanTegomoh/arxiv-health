                <p class="summary-text">This paper demonstrates that annealed population heterogeneity, where distinct individuals experience varying environmental conditions over time, acts as an implicit regularizer to bias evolutionary systems towards generalist solutions. This mechanism, mathematically analogous to a variant of mini-batching in stochastic gradient descent, introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise that promotes generalization crucial for anticipating future environmental changes and developing robust adaptive strategies.</p>

Such AI models could be designed to predict the evolution of pathogens (e.g., for novel vaccine design or anticipating drug resistance in bacteria/viruses) or the evolution of cancer cells in response to therapy, thereby contributing to 'future-proof' medical strategies and personalized medicine approaches.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Evolutionary systems must learn to generalize, often extrapolating from a
limited set of selective conditions to anticipate future environmental changes.
The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite
their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design
future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed
population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population
experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a
form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization.
Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted
demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and
effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward
generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the
mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an
effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering
noise-induced transitions.
  Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the
conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental
selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across
environments and anticipate novel challenges.</p>
