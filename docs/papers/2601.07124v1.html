                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper developed and validated a novel lead-aware deep learning framework, Lead-Aware Spatial Attention Networks (LASAN), for the automated multi-class classification of inherited arrhythmia syndromes (Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), and control) from ECGs. By optimally integrating LASAN with ECG foundation models via fine-tuning, the framework achieved state-of-the-art diagnostic performance (macro-AUROC 0.990) and demonstrated clinically plausible lead dependence, supporting its potential for automated ECG screening. It outperforms all existing published models for both binary and multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed deep learning, evaluating four pre-trained ECG foundation models with three transfer learning strategies: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined approaches. A novel Lead-Aware Spatial Attention Network (LASAN) was developed and integrated with these foundation models. Performance was benchmarked using macro-AUROC for multi-class tasks and AUROC for binary tasks. Model interpretability was assessed through 'lead-group masking,' quantifying the impact of specific ECG lead groups on diagnostic accuracy.</p>

                    <p>Fine-tuning was found to be the superior transfer learning strategy (mean macro-AUROC 0.904).

Lead masking confirmed physiological plausibility by demonstrating V1-V3 leads are crucial for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction upon masking), and lateral leads are preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% AUROC drop).</p>

Its potential to detect ARVC and LQTS earlier and more reliably could revolutionize preventative care, facilitating prompt genetic testing, risk stratification, and the implementation of life-saving therapies (e.g., ICD implantation, lifestyle modifications) before critical events occur, ultimately reducing sudden cardiac death rates.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) are inherited arrhythmia syndromes associated with sudden cardiac death. Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence. These findings support potential utility for automated ECG screening pending validation.</p>
