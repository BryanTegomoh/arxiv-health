                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the lack of comparative analysis between general Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) and specialized EEG-specific Foundation Models (EEGFMs) for EEG tasks. It introduces STAMP (Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling), a novel adapter that leverages univariate embeddings from general TSFMs to implicitly model EEG's spatial-temporal characteristics. STAMP achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs on 8 clinical EEG classification benchmarks while being lightweight and flexible.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on the development of STAMP, a Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling. This adapter is designed to integrate with pre-trained general Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) by taking their univariate embeddings as input. STAMP implicitly models the complex spatial-temporal relationships within multi-channel EEG data. The adapter's performance was rigorously evaluated through a comprehensive analysis on 8 distinct benchmark datasets, all involving clinical EEG data for classification tasks. Ablation studies were also conducted to understand the contribution of STAMP's individual components. The performance was benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art EEGFMs.</p>

Crucially, STAMP is lightweight in terms of trainable parameters and flexible in handling various input structures, demonstrating that general TSFMs can be effectively adapted for specialized EEG analysis without requiring extensive domain-specific model training.</p>

                <p>This work has significant clinical impact by providing a more accessible, efficient, and lightweight method for developing robust AI models for EEG-based clinical diagnostics. Clinicians and researchers can leverage powerful general TSFMs, augmented with STAMP, to analyze complex EEG patterns for conditions like epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other neurological impairments, potentially leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment strategies without the overhead of training massive domain-specific models from scratch.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.</p>
