                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and validated an interpretable data-driven approach, using Constrained Score Optimization (CSO), to recalibrate the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT). The CSO model significantly improved fall risk prediction (AUC-ROC=0.91 vs. 0.86 for original JHFRAT) over a retrospective cohort of 54,209 inpatient admissions, translating to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients weekly.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions to develop and validate Constrained Score Optimization (CSO) models. These models were designed to reweight the existing JHFRAT scoring items while explicitly maintaining its additive structure, interpretability, and clinical thresholds. Model performance was evaluated using AUC-ROC, comparing the CSO model against the original JHFRAT and a benchmark black-box XGBoost model. The study also assessed the CSO model's performance with and without additional EHR variables and its robustness to variations in risk labeling.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The CSO model significantly improved fall risk prediction, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.91, a 0.05 increase over the current JHFRAT's AUC-ROC of 0.86. This performance gain is projected to protect an additional 35 high-risk patients weekly within the Johns Hopkins Health System. Notably, CSO models demonstrated consistent performance with and without the inclusion of additional EHR variables, indicating efficiency. While a black-box XGBoost model achieved a higher AUC-ROC of 0.94, the CSO model exhibited superior robustness to variations in risk labeling, making it more reliable for clinical deployment.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The optimized JHFRAT, leveraging CSO, promises a more accurate and efficient identification of inpatients at high risk for falls. This precision allows healthcare providers to implement timely and appropriately scaled fall prevention interventions, reducing fall rates, preventing patient injuries, and potentially shortening hospital stays. Its interpretable nature ensures that clinicians can understand and trust the updated scoring, facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows and optimizing the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated as limitations, the abstract highlights a trade-off where a black-box model (XGBoost) achieved a higher predictive AUC (0.94) compared to the CSO model (0.91), suggesting that the chosen approach prioritizes interpretability and robustness over maximal predictive power. The study was also conducted within a single health system, and generalizability to diverse patient populations and healthcare settings may require further external validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.</p>
