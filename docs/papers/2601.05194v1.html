                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an interpretable data-driven approach, Constrained Score Optimization (CSO), to recalibrate the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) for improved fall risk prediction. By reweighting JHFRAT items while preserving its structure and clinical thresholds, the CSO model significantly outperformed the original tool, demonstrating improved predictive performance (AUC-ROC 0.91 vs. 0.86). This enhancement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients weekly across the health system and provides a robust, interpretable solution for optimizing inpatient fall prevention protocols.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.</p>
