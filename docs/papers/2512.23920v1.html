                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework for automated and objective fetal ultrasound skill assessment, addressing the subjectivity and time-intensity of traditional methods. It assesses skills by quantifying how well a clinical task is performed on acquired ultrasound images, utilizing jointly optimized clinical task and skill predictor networks without relying on manually predefined skill ratings. Validation on real-world fetal head scan videos demonstrates the framework's feasibility in predicting and indicating ultrasound skills through optimized task performance.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an automated skill assessment system for medical professionals (e.g., sonographers, obstetricians) performing fetal ultrasound scans. It utilizes a novel bi-level optimization framework consisting of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, jointly optimized, to objectively evaluate and quantify the performance of scanning tasks on acquired fetal ultrasound images, without relying on manual skill ratings. This aims to enhance medical training, standardize skill evaluation, and improve the quality of diagnostic imaging.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on a novel bi-level optimization framework. This framework comprises two interconnected neural networks: a 'clinical task predictor' and a 'skill predictor.' These two networks are not trained independently but are optimized jointly and simultaneously. The skill assessment is derived from the performance of the clinical task predictor on the acquired ultrasound images, where the skill predictor learns to identify characteristics indicative of better task outcomes. This 'optimized task performance' is then quantified and used as the objective skill indicator, bypassing the need for manual, pre-labeled skill ratings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.</p>
