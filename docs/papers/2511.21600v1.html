                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme designed for generative tabular data, addressing critical concerns regarding data provenance and misuse in fields like healthcare. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) after normalizing heterogeneous features, and employs a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method for enhanced robustness and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate its strong detectability, robustness against post-processing attacks, high data fidelity, and full support for mixed-type features.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.</p>
