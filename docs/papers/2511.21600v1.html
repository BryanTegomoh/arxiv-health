                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme designed for generative tabular data, addressing critical concerns about data provenance and misuse in fields like healthcare. By embedding watermark signals in the frequency domain via Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation, TAB-DRW ensures strong detectability and robustness against post-modifications. The method preserves high data fidelity and fully supports mixed discrete-continuous features, outperforming existing computationally expensive or limited techniques.</p>

                    <p>TAB-DRW is a post-editing watermarking scheme. It first normalizes heterogeneous features using Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization. Then, it applies the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the processed data. Watermark signals are embedded by adjusting the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries in the DFT output. This process relies on a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method, which allows for efficient, row-wise retrieval of watermark bits without needing additional storage.</p>

                <p>TAB-DRW can significantly enhance data governance and trust in the use of synthetic patient data within healthcare. It allows for the secure sharing of high-fidelity synthetic datasets for medical research, AI model development, and clinical decision support systems by ensuring accountability and traceability.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.</p>
