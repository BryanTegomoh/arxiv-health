                    <p>FAPEX is a novel neural architecture featuring a learnable fractional neural frame operator (FrNFO). The FrNFO utilizes fractional-order convolutions to perform adaptive time-frequency decomposition, allowing it to capture a wider range of electrophysiological signal dynamics (both high and low frequencies) than models with conventional convolutions. This process generates informative instantaneous phase and amplitude representations. The architecture further integrates structural state-space modeling and channelwise attention mechanisms to accommodate variability in electrode montages and recording modalities. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using nested cross-validation across 12 diverse benchmarks, comparing it against 33 supervised and self-supervised baselines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Precise, generalizable subject-agnostic seizure prediction (SASP) remains a
fundamental challenge due to the intrinsic complexity and significant spectral
variability of electrophysiological signals across individuals and recording
modalities. We propose FAPEX, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable
fractional neural frame operator (FrNFO) for adaptive time-frequency
decomposition. Unlike conventional models that exhibit spectral bias toward low
frequencies, our FrNFO employs fractional-order convolutions to capture both
high and low-frequency dynamics, achieving approximately 10% improvement in
F1-score and sensitivity over state-of-the-art baselines. The FrNFO enables the
extraction of instantaneous phase and amplitude representations that are
particularly informative for preictal biomarker discovery and enhance
out-of-distribution generalization. FAPEX further integrates structural
state-space modeling and channelwise attention, allowing it to handle
heterogeneous electrode montages. Evaluated across 12 benchmarks spanning
species (human, rat, dog, macaque) and modalities (Scalp-EEG, SEEG, ECoG, LFP),
FAPEX consistently outperforms 23 supervised and 10 self-supervised baselines
under nested cross-validation, with gains of up to 15% in sensitivity on
complex cross-domain scenarios. It further demonstrates superior performance in
several external validation cohorts. To our knowledge, these establish FAPEX as
the first epilepsy model to show consistent superiority in SASP, offering a
promising solution for discovering epileptic biomarker evidence supporting the
existence of a distinct and identifiable preictal state and clinical
translation.</p>
