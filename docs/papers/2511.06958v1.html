                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>WISE-MAE utilizes a two-stage wavelet-driven patch selection strategy within a Vision Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) framework. The first stage involves applying wavelet analysis to low-magnification whole-slide images to effectively screen and locate structurally rich, biologically relevant tissue regions. The second stage then extracts high-resolution patches exclusively from these identified regions, which are subsequently used for the MAE's self-supervised representation learning task, focusing computational effort on diagnostically valuable areas.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Whole-slide images are central to digital pathology, yet their extreme size
and scarce annotations make self-supervised learning essential. Masked
Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown
strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However,
conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes
irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful
tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted
framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based
learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies
a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification
to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for
detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of
pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations
across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues,
show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream
classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.</p>
