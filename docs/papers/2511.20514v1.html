                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel interventional ultrasound system designed for simultaneous real-time 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a core biopsy needle. The system utilizes a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle's bevel and a sparse receiver array to determine the needle tip's 3D location via time-of-flight measurements. This innovation provides clinicians with a quantitative 3D visualization of the needle tip superimposed on B-mode images, addressing the limitations of current 2D methods and poor needle visibility in complex tissues.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed system integrates a novel core biopsy needle containing a photoacoustic beacon within its bevel. Upon activation, the beacon emits ultrasound pulses, which are detected by a sparse array of ultrasound receivers positioned around a curvilinear ultrasound probe. The 3D coordinates of the needle tip are then computed in real-time based on the time-of-flight of these received signals. System performance was quantitatively evaluated in water and ex vivo tissue phantoms, utilizing X-ray CT as the ground truth reference for needle positions. Usability was further assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsy procedures on a separate ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present an interventional ultrasound system capable of simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a novel, trackable needle core biopsy tool. Interventional radiology procedures such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions are ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, during which having a clear understanding of the location of the needle tip is essential to avoid adverse events and the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>
