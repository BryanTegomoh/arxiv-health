                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel interventional ultrasound system that enables simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a core biopsy needle equipped with a photoacoustic beacon. The system addresses critical limitations of current 2D ultrasound guidance, which suffers from poor needle visibility and confusion over true tip location, by providing real-time, quantitative 3D visualization of the needle tip. Its performance was assessed in water and ex vivo tissue, and usability was evaluated by clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This innovation is highly relevant to interventional radiology as it promises to significantly improve the safety and accuracy of procedures like core needle biopsies by providing unambiguous 3D needle tip localization. This can reduce adverse events, the need for repeat procedures, and the reliance on ionizing and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The system employs a novel biopsy needle featuring a photoacoustic beacon in its bevel, which generates ultrasound. A sparse receiver array, integrated around a curvilinear ultrasound probe, detects these signals. The 3D needle tip location is then computed in real-time using time-of-flight measurements and superimposed onto live B-mode ultrasound images. Performance was assessed in water and ex vivo tissue phantoms, using X-ray computed tomography as a reference for accuracy. Usability was further evaluated by 12 clinicians conducting simulated biopsies on an ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present an interventional ultrasound system capable of simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a novel, trackable needle core biopsy tool. Interventional radiology procedures such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions are ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, during which having a clear understanding of the location of the needle tip is essential to avoid adverse events and the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>
