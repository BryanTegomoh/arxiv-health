                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel interventional ultrasound system designed for real-time 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a core biopsy needle featuring an embedded photoacoustic beacon. The system aims to overcome limitations of poor needle visibility and 2D guidance in conventional ultrasound, providing clinicians with precise, volumetric visualization of the needle tip's location. Performance was validated in phantom studies, and usability assessed by clinicians, indicating its potential to enhance procedure safety and efficiency.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The system integrates a photoacoustic beacon into the bevel of a core biopsy needle. This beacon, when activated, generates ultrasound waves. A sparse receiver array, strategically distributed around a standard curvilinear ultrasound probe, detects these emitted ultrasound signals. The 3D position of the needle tip is then precisely calculated based on the time-of-flight of these ultrasound waves. This calculated 3D location is subsequently superimposed in real-time onto the B-mode ultrasound images. The system's performance was quantitatively assessed in both water and ex vivo tissue phantoms, referencing positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. Its usability was qualitatively evaluated by a cohort of 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present an interventional ultrasound system capable of simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a novel, trackable needle core biopsy tool. Interventional radiology procedures such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions are ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, during which having a clear understanding of the location of the needle tip is essential to avoid adverse events and the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>
