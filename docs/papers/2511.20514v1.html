                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel interventional ultrasound system that provides simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance for core needle biopsies using a specialized trackable needle. It addresses the common challenge of poor needle visibility and positional ambiguity in conventional ultrasound guidance by enabling real-time, quantitative visualization of the needle tip's 3D location superimposed on B-mode images. The system's performance was assessed in phantoms, and its usability was evaluated by clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate needle tip visualization is crucial during interventional radiology procedures like core needle biopsies to prevent adverse events, repeat procedures, and reliance on ionizing X-ray CT guidance. This system directly addresses these critical needs by providing unambiguous 3D real-time guidance, enhancing safety, efficiency, and potentially reducing procedural costs and radiation exposure.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The developed system incorporates a photoacoustic beacon into the bevel of a core biopsy needle. This beacon emits ultrasound signals, whose time-of-flight to a sparse receiver array, integrated around a standard curvilinear ultrasound probe, is measured to calculate the real-time 3D position of the needle tip. This 3D location is then quantitatively displayed and superimposed onto live B-mode ultrasound images. System performance was rigorously assessed in water and ex vivo tissue phantoms, referencing positions against X-ray computed tomography. Usability was evaluated through simulated biopsies performed by 12 clinicians on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>

It could reduce adverse events, decrease the necessity for costly and radiation-emitting X-ray CT guidance, lower the incidence of repeat procedures, and broaden the accessibility of complex biopsies by providing clear, real-time guidance to clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present an interventional ultrasound system capable of simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a novel, trackable needle core biopsy tool. Interventional radiology procedures such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions are ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, during which having a clear understanding of the location of the needle tip is essential to avoid adverse events and the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.</p>
