                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a framework for building trusted and auditable agentic AI systems using a combination of LangChain-based multi-agent systems and permissioned blockchain. In a healthcare context, this framework could be applied to AI agents performing tasks such as real-time patient monitoring (as explicitly mentioned 'healthcare monitoring' experiment), automated medical decision support, managing medical supply chains (linking to 'smart inventory management'), ensuring data integrity in electronic health records, or overseeing autonomous systems in remote care. The blockchain component ensures immutable audit trails, policy enforcement, and verifies inputs/outputs, which is critical for accountability and preventing unauthorized practices in high-stakes healthcare scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.</p>
