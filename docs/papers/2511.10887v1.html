                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MedPath introduces a novel, large-scale, multi-domain biomedical Entity Linking (EL) dataset designed to address the fragmentation of data and the lack of explainable models in biomedical NLP. It unifies and normalizes entities from nine existing datasets using UMLS, enriching them with extensive cross-vocabulary mappings and hierarchical ontological paths. This dataset is poised to enable the development of semantic-rich, interpretable, and interoperable clinical NLP systems.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedPath was constructed as a dataset creation effort by aggregating and unifying nine pre-existing expert-annotated biomedical Entity Linking datasets. The methodology involved three key steps: 1) Normalizing all identified entities to the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) for consistent semantic representation. 2) Augmenting these normalized entities with extensive cross-references and mappings to 62 additional biomedical vocabularies to broaden their contextual understanding. 3) Critically, enriching each entity by extracting and integrating its full hierarchical ontological path (general-to-specific relationships) from up to 11 relevant biomedical vocabularies, thereby embedding deep semantic structure.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary 'finding' is the successful creation and comprehensive structuring of the MedPath dataset itself, which represents a significant advancement in biomedical NLP resources. This dataset successfully addresses the identified challenges by: providing a unified, large-scale, and multi-domain resource for biomedical Entity Linking; standardizing entities through robust UMLS normalization; and, most notably, enhancing semantic richness and interpretability through extensive cross-vocabulary mappings (62 vocabularies) and deep ontological path integration (11 vocabularies). This foundational work enables the development of future semantic-aware and explainable AI models.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>MedPath directly impacts clinical practice by enabling the development of more accurate, robust, and explainable AI models for clinical NLP. This will enhance the automated extraction of critical information from electronic health records, improve clinical decision support systems by providing contextually rich and verifiable entity links, and facilitate advanced medical knowledge discovery from vast amounts of biomedical literature. Ultimately, this can lead to more precise diagnostics, personalized treatment strategies, improved pharmacovigilance, and increased trust in AI-driven healthcare solutions.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily discusses the limitations of the *current field* (fragmented data, lack of explainable models, semantically-blind metrics) that MedPath aims to overcome, rather than explicit limitations of MedPath itself. While not detailed in the abstract, inherent challenges in creating such a large-scale, integrated dataset typically include ensuring complete and up-to-date coverage of all medical terminologies, managing the dynamic evolution of biomedical vocabularies, and potential propagation of biases or inconsistencies from the aggregated source datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.</p>
