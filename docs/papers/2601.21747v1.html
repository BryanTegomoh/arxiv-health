                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel machine learning framework for temporal sepsis modeling that prioritizes extreme interpretability, addressing the limitations of existing deep learning models which often lack transparency. It proposes a relational approach to process temporal electronic medical record (EMR) data, constructing interpretable features via a propositionalisation technique, and classifying them using a selective Naive Bayesian classifier. The framework's relevance and comprehensive fourfold interpretability (univariate, global, local, and counterfactual) are demonstrated through experimental validation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.</p>
