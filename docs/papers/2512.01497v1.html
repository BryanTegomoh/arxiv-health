                <p>The algorithms developed can have significant clinical impact by enabling more effective strategies for disease intervention. In epidemiology, they can identify key individuals or communities (nodes) whose isolation or vaccination would most efficiently halt an epidemic's spread. In drug discovery, these methods could pinpoint critical molecular targets within disease pathways, leading to more precise and effective therapeutic interventions by disrupting specific biological networks.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the proposed methods. However, a common limitation for algorithmic papers using random graphs is the need for validation on real-world, complex biological or epidemiological network data, which often exhibit non-random structures and specific statistical properties not fully captured by synthetic graphs. The generalizability to highly specific, heterogeneous biological systems might require further adaptation.</p>

Further research could explore more complex stochastic models for edge existence, incorporate temporal dynamics into node criticality, or integrate domain-specific biological knowledge to refine the node detection process.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Given a network, the critical node detection problem finds a subset of nodes whose removal disrupts the network connectivity. Since many real-world systems are naturally modeled as graphs, assessing the vulnerability of the network is essential, with applications in transportation systems, traffic forecasting, epidemic control, and biological networks. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Heuristic methods often illustrate the strongest results with high scalability, while learning-based methods maintain nearly constant inference time as the network size and density grow.</p>
