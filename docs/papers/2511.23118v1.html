                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This systematic review critically appraises machine learning (ML) models developed for violence prediction, synthesizing data from 38 studies on 40 models. It reveals that while discrimination (AUC 0.68-0.99) is often reported, crucial aspects like calibration and external validation are largely neglected, and most studies suffer from high risk of bias. The paper concludes that current black-box ML models have limited clinical utility due to methodological flaws but offer promise for identifying high-risk individuals, outlining five key recommendations for future, more robust development.</p>

                    <li>A systematic review identified 38 studies reporting the development and/or validation of 40 machine learning models for predicting various forms of violent behavior.</li>
                    
                    <li>Model discrimination performance, primarily reported by Area Under the Curve (AUC), ranged widely from 0.68 to 0.99, indicating varying levels of predictive accuracy.</li>
                    
                    <li>Critical performance metrics like calibration were reported in only 8 studies, and external validation in a mere 3, highlighting significant gaps in assessing model generalizability and reliability.</li>
                    
                    <li>A substantial majority (31 out of 38) of the reviewed studies were found to have a high risk of bias, particularly in the analysis domain, severely impacting the trustworthiness of their findings.</li>
                    
                    <li>The overall clinical utility of existing violence prediction models is deemed poor due to high risks of overfitting from small samples, inadequate transparent reporting, and limited generalizability.</li>

                    <p>The authors conducted a systematic search across nine bibliographic databases and Google Scholar (up to September 2025) for studies on ML methods for violence prediction.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The review identified 38 studies developing/validating 40 ML models. Most reported AUC (range 0.68-0.99), but calibration was reported by only eight studies, and external validation by three. 31 studies had a high risk of bias (mainly analysis-related), while only three had low risk. The overall clinical utility is poor due to overfitting, lack of transparent reporting, and low generalizability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Currently, black-box ML models for violence prediction have limited direct applicability in clinical settings due to their poor methodological quality, lack of validation, and generalizability issues. However, with significant methodological improvements, they hold promise for more effectively identifying high-risk individuals, which could inform stratified interventions and risk management strategies in forensic and mental health services.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The systematic review highlighted significant limitations within the studies reviewed, including high risks of overfitting due to small sample sizes, lack of transparent reporting of methods and results (especially calibration and external validation), and consequently, poor generalizability of the models. A high prevalence of bias, particularly in the analysis domain, further undermines the validity of current findings.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Purpose To conduct a systematic review of machine learning models for predicting violent behaviour by synthesising and appraising their validity, usefulness, and performance.
  Methods We systematically searched nine bibliographic databases and Google Scholar up to September 2025 for development and/or validation studies on machine learning methods for predicting all forms of violent behaviour. We synthesised the results by summarising discrimination and calibration performance statistics and evaluated study quality by examining risk of bias and clinical utility.
  Results We identified 38 studies reporting the development and validation of 40 models. Most studies reported Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the discrimination statistic with a range of 0.68-0.99. Only eight studies reported calibration performance, and three studies reported external validation. 31 studies had a high risk of bias, mainly in the analysis domain, and three studies had low risk of bias. The overall clinical utility of violence prediction models is poor, as indicated by risks of overfitting due to small samples, lack of transparent reporting, and low generalisability.
  Conclusion Although black box machine learning models currently have limited applicability in clinical settings, they may show promise for identifying high-risk individuals. We recommend five key considerations for violence prediction modelling: (i) ensuring methodological quality (e.g. following guidelines) and interdisciplinary collaborations; (ii) using black box algorithms only for highly complex data; (iii) incorporating dynamic predictions to allow for risk monitoring; (iv) developing more trustworthy algorithms using explainable methods; and (v) applying causal machine learning approaches where appropriate.</p>
