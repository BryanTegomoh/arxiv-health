                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper establishes an exact equivalence between two prominent policy learning approaches‚ÄîEmpirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) and the plug-in method based on Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation. By demonstrating that both approaches are rooted in the same underlying optimization problem via a reparameterization, it unifies their theoretical foundations and introduces a novel, computationally efficient regularization method for policy learning that bypasses the typically NP-hard steps associated with EWM.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The methods developed in this paper could be applied to build AI systems that recommend optimal medical treatments or interventions for individual patients based on their unique characteristics (covariates). This would enable personalized treatment plans, help clinicians choose the most effective therapies, and optimize resource allocation in healthcare. For instance, an AI could learn from patient data to recommend which cancer therapy, medication dosage, or preventive measure is most likely to maximize a patient's health outcomes, considering their genetic profile, lifestyle, and medical history. The proposed computationally efficient training procedure would make such applications more feasible in real-world clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.</p>
