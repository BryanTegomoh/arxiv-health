                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper establishes a fundamental equivalence between two prominent policy learning paradigms: Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) and the plug-in approach based on Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation. By demonstrating that both are based on essentially the same optimization problem via a reparameterization, the study unifies their theoretical guarantees and interchangability. Leveraging this insight, the author proposes a novel regularization method that offers a convex and computationally efficient training procedure for policy learning, circumventing the typically NP-hard combinatorial step of EWM.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.</p>
