                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper establishes an exact equivalence between two major policy learning paradigms, Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) and the plug-in approach based on Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation, through a reparameterization of the policy class. This unification reveals their interchangeability and shared theoretical guarantees, leading to the development of a novel, convex, and computationally efficient regularization method for policy learning that circumvents the NP-hard combinatorial step inherent in traditional EWM.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research would enable the development of more sophisticated and efficient AI systems for personalized treatment recommendations. For instance, an AI could learn from patient data (covariates) to suggest the optimal treatment or intervention (policy) that maximizes an individual patient's health outcome, minimizes adverse effects, or optimizes public health initiatives. The proposed methods provide a computational framework to train these 'treatment recommendation policies' more effectively, bridging theoretical approaches and making them more applicable in real-world healthcare AI applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.</p>
