                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed methodology for patient-level information extraction is multi-modal, leveraging both structured and unstructured EHR data. Expert-informed Bayesian networks are utilized to process and model relationships within tabular features (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, lab results). Concurrently, neural text classifiers are employed to extract symptomatic information from unstructured clinical notes (e.g., discharge summaries). The predictions from these distinct models are then probabilistically fused using virtual evidence, which is significantly enhanced by a novel 'consistency node' designed to improve prediction calibration, handle missing data, and resolve contradictions between the different data sources.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the successful development of a multi-modal information extraction method that effectively integrates tabular and textual EHR data. Crucially, the introduction of a 'consistency node' into the virtual evidence fusion mechanism significantly improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone. This enhancement allows the Bayesian network to more accurately adjust the outputs of neural text classifiers, demonstrating superior capability in handling missing information and resolving contradictions between the disparate data modalities, leading to more robust patient-level feature extraction.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by enabling the creation of more complete, accurate, and structured patient datasets from existing EHRs. This will empower clinicians and researchers to build more transparent, interpretable, and reliable clinical decision support systems, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, more personalized treatment plans, enhanced patient safety, and accelerated medical research by making complex EHR data more accessible and actionable.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.</p>
