                <p>This work has the potential to significantly impact clinical translation by accelerating the early-stage discovery and design of novel therapeutic compounds for Alzheimer's disease, specifically targeting SIK3. By providing a scalable, data-efficient computational platform for molecular design, it could substantially reduce the time, cost, and experimental burden associated with identifying promising drug candidates, thereby expediting the development of new treatment options for AD and potentially other challenging diseases.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the proposed methodology. However, it highlights a strength – the ability to circumvent the need for large labeled datasets – which is often a significant limitation in early-stage drug discovery. While the approach generated molecules with 'high binding affinity,' this is implied to be computationally predicted, and experimental validation of affinity and SIK3 inhibition in biological systems would be a necessary subsequent step not covered by the abstract.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD), a progressive neuro-degenerative disorder, currently
lacks effective therapeutic strategies that can modify disease progression.
Recent studies have highlighted the circadian rhythm critical role in AD
pathophysiology, implicating circadian clock kinases, such as the
Salt-Inducible Kinase 3 (SIK3), as promising therapeutic target. Generative AI
models have surpassed traditional methods of drug discovery, untapping the vast
unexplored chemical space of drug-like molecules. We present a
sequence-to-sequence Variational Autoencoder (Seq2Seq-VAE) model guided by an
Active Learning (AL) approach to optimize molecular generation. Our pipeline
iteratively guided a pre-trained Seq2Seq-VAE model towards the pharmacological
landscape relevant to SIK3 using a two-step framework, an inner loop that
iteratively improves physiochemical properties profile, drug likeliness and
synthesizability, followed by an outer loop that steer the latent space towards
high-affinity ligands for SIK3. Our approach introduces feedback-driven
optimization without requiring large labeled datasets, making it particularly
suited for early-stage drug discovery in under-explored therapeutic targets.
Our results demonstrate the models convergence toward SIK3-specific small
molecules with desired properties and high binding affinity. This work
highlights the use of generative AI combined with AL for rational drug
discovery that can be extended to other protein targets with minimal
modifications, offering a scalable solution to the molecular design bottleneck
in drug design.</p>
