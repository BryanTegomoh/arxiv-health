                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MedGEN-Bench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to overcome limitations in existing medical visual benchmarks, which often feature ambiguous queries and oversimplified reasoning. It comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs across six imaging modalities and 16 clinical tasks, specifically structured for open-ended, contextually intertwined generation requiring sophisticated cross-modal reasoning. The benchmark, along with a novel three-tier assessment framework, systematically evaluates various Vision-Language Models to advance medical AI research towards generating integrated textual diagnoses and corresponding medical images for authentic clinical workflows.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involves the creation of MedGEN-Bench by curating 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs across six diverse imaging modalities and multiple clinical tasks. This benchmark is structured into three distinct formats (Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation) designed to prompt open-ended, contextually intertwined generative outputs requiring cross-modal reasoning. For evaluation, a novel three-tier assessment framework was developed, integrating pixel-level metrics for image quality, semantic text analysis for textual accuracy, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring for practical utility. This framework was then applied to systematically assess the performance of 18 diverse AI models, including 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 Vision-Language Models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly gain traction in medical applications, clinicians are progressively expecting AI systems not only to generate textual diagnoses but also to produce corresponding medical images that integrate seamlessly into authentic clinical workflows. Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.</p>
