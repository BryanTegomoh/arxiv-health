                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research investigates the feasibility of inferring fitness parameters and the order of genotype fitness from population-wide, whole-genome, time-stratified genomic data. Using *in silico* simulations of populations evolving under natural selection, mutation, and recombination, the study successfully delineates specific parameter ranges where such inference is possible and where it is not. The work provides a crucial framework for assessing when fitness inference is robustly feasible from genomic surveillance data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is vital for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of human pathogens, including the development of drug resistance and vaccine escape, by establishing when their fitness landscapes can be reliably inferred from genomic surveillance data. This knowledge can inform public health interventions and therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>AI/machine learning models could be applied to perform the 'fitness inference' described, utilizing large-scale genomic and temporal data from pathogen populations. This would allow for the prediction of evolutionary trajectories of pathogens, identification of mutations conferring increased fitness (e.g., drug resistance or virulence), and real-time surveillance for emerging threats. Such AI applications could inform public health interventions, drug development strategies, and biosecurity measures.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized *in silico* population genetics simulations to model populations evolving under various conditions of natural selection, mutation, and recombination. Within these simulations, the authors systematically tested the ability to accurately infer underlying fitness parameters and the fitness order of different genotypes from the generated genomic data, thereby delineating the conditions under which such inference is successful.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the identification of distinct parameter ranges (e.g., related to population size, mutation rates, selection coefficients, recombination rates) within which fitness parameters and genotype fitness order can be reliably inferred from genomic data. Conversely, the study also identified ranges where such inference is not feasible, providing a clear boundary for the applicability of these methods. This robust delineation forms a predictive framework for fitness inference.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By defining the feasibility landscape for fitness inference, this framework can guide the design of genomic surveillance programs for rapidly evolving pathogens (e.g., viruses like SARS-CoV-2, drug-resistant bacteria). It allows researchers and public health officials to assess the likelihood of accurately predicting pathogen evolution, anticipating the emergence of new variants with altered transmissibility, virulence, or drug resistance, thereby enabling more timely and effective clinical interventions and public health responses.</p>

                <p>The primary limitation noted is that fitness inference is only feasible within specific parameter ranges, implying that current methods are not universally applicable. The study's reliance on *in silico* simulations means its findings need validation with real-world genomic data from biological systems, though the paper surveys potential candidates for this application.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We consider populations evolving according to natural selection, mutation,
and recombination, and assume that the genomes of all or a representative
selection of individuals are known. We pose the problem if it is possible to
infer fitness parameters and genotype fitness order from such data. We tested
this hypothesis in simulated populations. We delineate parameter ranges where
this is possible and other ranges where it is not.Our work provides a framework
for determining when fitness inference is feasible from population-wide,
whole-genome, time-stratified data and highlights settings where it is not. We
give a brief survey of biological model organisms and human pathogens that fit
into this framework.</p>
