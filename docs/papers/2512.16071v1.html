                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SoilScanner, a novel radio frequency (RF)-based wireless system designed for the rapid detection of lead (Pb) contamination in soil, addressing the limitations of current labor-intensive and costly methods. The system leverages the discovery that different salts, including lead compounds, distinctively affect radio signal propagation patterns across various frequencies. SoilScanner demonstrated 72% accuracy in classifying soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (with a 200 ppm threshold), crucially avoiding misclassification for any samples exceeding 500 ppm Pb, thereby proving the feasibility of developing portable and affordable Pb detection devices.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved a two-pronged approach. Initially, controlled laboratory experiments were conducted by manually introducing specific salts (e.g., NaCl, Pb(NO3)2) into clean soil samples to characterize their unique effects on the reflection patterns of different radio frequency signals. Subsequently, these findings were applied and validated using uncontrolled, real-world field soil samples, with a machine learning model employed to interpret the RF signal data for classifying lead contamination levels.</p>

                    <p>The SoilScanner system demonstrated a classification accuracy of 72% for distinguishing between low-Pb and high-Pb soil samples, based on a threshold of 200 ppm. A critical finding for public health surveillance is that the system exhibited no misclassifications for any soil samples containing lead levels exceeding 500 ppm, indicating strong reliability for identifying highly contaminated sites.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology has the potential for significant clinical and public health impact by enabling rapid, portable, and affordable screening of soil lead contamination in urban and agricultural settings. This capability allows for proactive identification of hazardous areas, facilitating targeted public health interventions such as community education, advising safe gardening practices, and guiding remediation efforts, thereby reducing lead exposure and preventing associated health issues, particularly in children.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study primarily demonstrates the 'feasibility' of the approach, suggesting it is a proof-of-concept rather than a fully developed and robust solution. An accuracy of 72% for the 200 ppm threshold indicates room for improvement in classification performance for broader applicability and a higher degree of confidence in all lead concentration ranges. The specific thresholds and performance metrics presented may also be context-dependent and require further validation across diverse soil types and environmental conditions.</p>

                <p>The study's conclusion directly implies future work focused on developing, refining, and robustly validating a portable and affordable SoilScanner device for widespread field deployment. This would involve improving classification accuracy, expanding the dynamic range and sensitivity for detecting a wider spectrum of lead concentrations, and ensuring consistent performance across various soil compositions and environmental variables to transition from feasibility to practical implementation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.</p>
