                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid state-space model designed for enhanced time-series anomaly detection, addressing the limitations of direct Mamba application in capturing complex temporal and nonlinear dynamics. The architecture integrates a Fourier layer for multi-scale frequency feature extraction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for superior nonlinear representation, and the Mamba selective state-space model for efficient long-sequence processing, augmented by a temporal gating mechanism. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that Fourier-KAN-Mamba significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in anomaly detection.</p>

                    <p>The Fourier-KAN-Mamba model is a hybrid deep learning architecture.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Time-series anomaly detection plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications, including industrial monitoring and fault diagnosis. Recently, Mamba-based state-space models have shown remarkable efficiency in long-sequence modeling. However, directly applying Mamba to anomaly detection tasks still faces challenges in capturing complex temporal patterns and nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we propose Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Fourier layer, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Mamba selective state-space model. The Fourier layer extracts multi-scale frequency features, KAN enhances nonlinear representation capability, and a temporal gating control mechanism further improves the model's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.
