                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel dataset to rigorously evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) comprehension of drug mechanisms, focusing on both factual recall and counterfactual reasoning in unseen situations. The study reveals that o4-mini and Qwen3-4B-thinking models demonstrate superior performance among tested LLMs, and highlights that open-world reasoning and counterfactuals affecting internal links of drug mechanism chains pose significantly greater challenges.</p>

                    <li>LLMs require deep understanding of drug mechanisms, beyond just factual knowledge, for applications in drug development, repurposing, and personalized medicine.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study's methodology centers on the creation of a specialized dataset designed to test LLMs on two dimensions: factual knowledge of established drug mechanisms and the ability to reason under counterfactual conditions. These counterfactuals represent novel situations unlikely to be present in training data. The dataset evaluates LLMs on their capacity to infer the utility of a drug for a disease by composing the effects of interactions in a candidate mechanism chain. Performance comparisons were then made across several prominent LLMs (OpenAI's o4-mini, 4o, o3, o3-mini, and Qwen3-4B-thinking) under both open-world (knowledge recall required) and closed-world (knowledge provided) settings, and by varying the complexity of counterfactuals.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The o4-mini model demonstrated superior understanding and reasoning capabilities compared to other OpenAI models tested (4o, o3, o3-mini). Notably, the smaller Qwen3-4B-thinking model achieved comparable or even superior performance to o4-mini. The research revealed that open-world reasoning tasks, requiring LLM knowledge recall, are significantly harder than closed-world tasks. Furthermore, counterfactual scenarios altering internal links within a drug's mechanism chain posed a greater challenge for LLMs than those affecting the initial drug-target interaction.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a benchmark for developing LLMs capable of more sophisticated biomedical reasoning, which could revolutionize drug discovery by predicting novel drug-disease relationships, streamlining drug repurposing efforts, and informing personalized treatment strategies by understanding individual variability in drug response based on detailed mechanism insights. Improved LLM performance in this area could lead to faster identification of promising therapeutic candidates and more precise, individualized medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized
medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a
deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about
relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described
as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into
one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing
the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference
about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a
dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and
their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as
counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training.
Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini
models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely
matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We
demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the
model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world
setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that
counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much
harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.</p>
