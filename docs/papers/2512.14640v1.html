                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents the first multicenter lymphoma subtyping benchmark dataset for deep learning, leveraging HE-stained whole slide images. It systematically evaluates five pathology foundation models combined with two Multiple Instance Learning aggregators across various magnifications, achieving over 80% balanced accuracy on in-distribution data but revealing a substantial drop to around 60% on out-of-distribution sets, highlighting critical generalization challenges.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research aims to revolutionize lymphoma diagnosis by developing deep learning tools that can rapidly and accurately subtype lymphomas using only standard HE-stained slides, thereby potentially reducing diagnostic delays, lowering healthcare costs associated with extensive ancillary testing, and improving timely access to specific treatment regimens.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application described is the development and benchmarking of deep learning models, specifically multiple instance learning (MIL) models combined with various pathology foundation models, to automatically subtype lymphoma from whole slide images (WSIs) of HE-stained tissue. This aims to assist pathologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, potentially reducing healthcare costs and treatment delays by providing diagnostic insights from readily available slides without requiring extensive additional tests like immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved constructing a novel multicenter dataset of HE-stained whole slide images for lymphoma subtyping. Five established pathology foundation models were integrated with two Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) aggregators (attention-based and transformer-based). These deep learning systems were then rigorously benchmarked across three different magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x) on both in-distribution and challenging out-of-distribution test sets, with performance primarily measured by multiclass balanced accuracy.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Deep learning models demonstrated strong performance (>80% balanced accuracy) for lymphoma subtyping on in-distribution HE-stained WSI data. 40x magnification was determined to be optimal and sufficient. However, the models exhibited a significant vulnerability, with performance dropping substantially to approximately 60% balanced accuracy on out-of-distribution test sets, revealing a critical lack of generalization capability across unseen data sources.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings suggest that deep learning holds significant promise for automating or assisting in the complex task of lymphoma subtyping, potentially enabling faster, more accessible, and more cost-effective diagnoses by reducing the need for extensive immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular tests. While in-distribution performance is high, the generalization challenge must be robustly addressed before widespread clinical adoption to ensure reliable performance across diverse patient populations and institutions.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The most prominent limitation is the substantial drop in model performance observed on out-of-distribution test sets, indicating a critical lack of generalization across different data sources. Additionally, the multicenter dataset, while valuable, covers only four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy tissue, omitting the numerous rarer lymphoma variants.</p>

The authors also facilitate this by providing an automated benchmarking pipeline for future research efforts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</p>
