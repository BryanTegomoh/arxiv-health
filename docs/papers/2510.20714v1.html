                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study optimized clinical fall risk prediction by integrating Electronic Health Record (EHR) variables with the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) using a data-driven constrained score optimization (CSO) model. The CSO model significantly improved predictive performance (AUC-ROC=0.91) compared to the standard JHFRAT (AUC-ROC=0.86), offering a robust and interpretable method for enhancing inpatient fall prevention.</p>

                    <p>The CSO model significantly improved fall risk prediction (AUC-ROC=0.91) over the current JHFRAT (AUC-ROC=0.86). Interestingly, the additional EHR variables did not substantially improve the CSO model's performance. Although XGBoost achieved a higher AUC-ROC (0.94), the CSO model demonstrated superior robustness to variations in risk labeling, balancing predictive power with interpretability and stability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The enhanced fall risk prediction model offers health systems a more accurate and robust tool to identify high-risk patients. This can lead to more effective and targeted fall prevention strategies, better allocation of healthcare resources, and ultimately, a reduction in inpatient falls, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare outcomes.</p>

                <p>Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, however, the study is limited to data from Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals, which may affect generalizability to other healthcare systems. The abstract also notes a trade-off where the CSO model (knowledge-based) has lower raw predictive power (AUC-ROC) compared to a black-box model (XGBoost) but offers higher robustness and interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.</p>
