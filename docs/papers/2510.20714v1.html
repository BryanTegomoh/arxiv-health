                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed a data-driven constrained score optimization (CSO) model to enhance the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) for inpatient fall risk prediction. The CSO model, integrating EHR variables while maintaining interpretability, significantly improved predictive performance (AUC-ROC 0.91) compared to the original JHFRAT (AUC-ROC 0.86). This approach offers a robust, evidence-based method for health systems to optimize fall prevention protocols and improve patient safety.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.</p>
