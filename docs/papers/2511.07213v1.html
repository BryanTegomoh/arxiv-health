                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Chronic pain is a global health challenge affecting millions of individuals,
making it essential for physicians to have reliable and objective methods to
measure the functional impact of clinical treatments. Traditionally used
methods, like the numeric rating scale, while personalized and easy to use, are
subjective due to their self-reported nature. Thus, this paper proposes DETECT
(Data-Driven Evaluation of Treatments Enabled by Classification Transformers),
a data-driven framework that assesses treatment success by comparing patient
activities of daily life before and after treatment. We use DETECT on public
benchmark datasets and simulated patient data from smartphone sensors. Our
results demonstrate that DETECT is objective yet lightweight, making it a
significant and novel contribution to clinical decision-making. By using
DETECT, independently or together with other self-reported metrics, physicians
can improve their understanding of their treatment impacts, ultimately leading
to more personalized and responsive patient care.</p>
