                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel transformer-based model significantly enhancing the automated de-identification of radiology reports by leveraging large-scale, diverse training data and incorporating an 'AGE' PHI category. The model achieves superior performance (F1 scores up to 0.996) for Protected Health Information (PHI) detection, outperforming both prior academic models and leading commercial cloud vendor systems. This work establishes a new benchmark for secure and accurate clinical text processing.</p>

                    <p>The study enhanced a transformer-based PHI de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning it on two large, manually annotated radiology corpora from Stanford, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT, abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.</p>
