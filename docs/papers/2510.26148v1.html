                    <p>The STAR framework utilizes a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network architecture for temporal modeling, designed for reduced computational overhead. Prior to neural network processing, raw Wi-Fi CSI amplitude data undergoes a multi-stage pre-processing pipeline: median filtering for initial noise suppression, an 8th-order Butterworth low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for extracting robust spatial-temporal features. The system is deployed on a Rockchip RV1126 processor with an integrated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for accelerated inference, receiving CSI data from an ESP32-S3-based acquisition module. Hardware-aware co-optimization, including INT8 quantization, is applied to achieve efficient on-device execution.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.</p>
