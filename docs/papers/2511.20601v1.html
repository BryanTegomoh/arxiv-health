                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper identifies and formalizes the "Driver-Blindness" phenomenon in deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting, where models consistently fail to leverage crucial clinical drivers like insulin, meals, and activity. It attributes this failure to architectural biases, data fidelity gaps, and physiological heterogeneity, proposing strategies to mitigate this issue and recommending routine reporting of driver-leveraging performance metrics.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate blood glucose forecasting is critical for effective diabetes management, and models that ignore key drivers miss opportunities for better prediction and clinical decision support. Understanding and overcoming Driver-Blindness can lead to more physiologically informed and reliable prediction tools, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia risks.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper focuses on the application of deep sequence models (a form of AI) for blood glucose forecasting. This AI application aims to predict future blood glucose levels, which is crucial for personalized diabetes management, optimization of insulin delivery (e.g., in artificial pancreas systems), and proactive health interventions for individuals with diabetes. The research helps improve the reliability and clinical utility of these AI-driven health tools.</p>

                    <li>**Driver-Blindness Definition:** Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to utilize clinically informative drivers (insulin, meals, activity), despite clear physiological mechanisms.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Quantification of Driver-Blindness:** The phenomenon is formalized by $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, representing the performance gain of multivariate models (incorporating drivers) over matched univariate baselines (relying solely on glucose history).</li>
                    
                    <li>**Empirical Observation:** Across existing literature, $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ is typically found to be near zero, indicating a widespread failure of models to benefit from driver inclusion.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Three Root Causes (C1, C2, C3):** Driver-Blindness is attributed to architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps leading to noisy and confounded driver data (C2), and physiological heterogeneity undermining population-level models (C3).</li>
                    
                    <li>**Mitigation Strategies:** The paper synthesizes methods that partially address Driver-Blindness, including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization techniques.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Call for Reporting:** It recommends that future research routinely report $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art, promoting more clinically relevant model development.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This paper's methodology involves a meta-analysis and synthesis of existing literature on deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting. It formalizes an observed phenomenon (Driver-Blindness) by defining a specific metric ($Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$), identifies and categorizes the underlying causes, and synthesizes mitigation strategies based on current research trends. It is a conceptual and analytical contribution, not an experimental one presenting new data.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The central finding is the formalization of "Driver-Blindness" as a pervasive issue in blood glucose forecasting models, quantified by a near-zero $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ across the literature. This blindness is systematically linked to three interacting factors: architectural predisposition to autocorrelation, low fidelity of driver data, and inter-patient physiological variability.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By highlighting the failure of current models to incorporate critical physiological drivers, this research directs future efforts towards developing more clinically relevant and trustworthy prediction models for diabetes. Improved models that truly leverage insulin, meal, and activity data could offer more personalized and accurate glucose predictions, leading to better-informed insulin dosing, meal planning, and activity management, ultimately enhancing glycemic control and quality of life for individuals with diabetes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily discusses limitations inherent to the *current state of the art* in blood glucose forecasting rather than limitations of the current paper itself. These include data fidelity gaps (noisy/confounded driver data) and physiological heterogeneity across individuals, which pose significant challenges for developing robust, generalizable population-level models that effectively utilize drivers.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should routinely report $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ to quantitatively assess the contribution of clinical drivers. Efforts should focus on developing models that incorporate physiological feature encoders, causal regularization techniques, and personalization strategies to effectively mitigate Driver-Blindness and create more clinically informative forecasting tools.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.</p>
