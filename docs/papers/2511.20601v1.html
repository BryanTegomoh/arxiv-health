                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper identifies and formalizes the 'Driver-Blindness Phenomenon' in deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting, where these models consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers like insulin, meals, and activity. It introduces $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, a metric to quantify the performance gain from incorporating drivers, and observes that this gain is typically near zero across the literature. The authors attribute this to architectural biases, data fidelity issues, and physiological heterogeneity, proposing mitigation strategies and recommending routine reporting of $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ to ensure models are truly leveraging clinical insights.</p>

                    <li>Driver-Blindness is formalized by $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, representing the performance gain of multivariate models incorporating drivers over matched univariate baselines that only use glucose history.</li>
                    
                    <li>Analysis of existing literature reveals that $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ is consistently near zero, indicating a widespread inability of current models to effectively leverage driver information.</li>
                    
                    <li>Three interacting causes for Driver-Blindness are identified: (C1) architectural biases in deep models favoring autocorrelation, (C2) data fidelity gaps leading to noisy and confounded driver data, and (C3) physiological heterogeneity undermining population-level model effectiveness.</li>
                    
                    <li>Strategies to partially mitigate Driver-Blindness include the development of physiological feature encoders, application of causal regularization techniques, and personalization of models.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper primarily employs a conceptual analysis and synthesis approach. It formalizes a novel metric, $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, to quantify a specific failure mode observed in deep learning models applied to medical data. The authors synthesize observations from existing literature to identify and categorize the root causes (C1, C2, C3) of this phenomenon and propose a set of mitigation strategies. The methodology is diagnostic and prescriptive, aiming to redefine evaluation standards.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The central finding is that deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting generally exhibit 'Driver-Blindness,' with their performance gain from incorporating clinical drivers ($Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$) being negligible. This blindness is systematically explained by architectural limitations, data quality issues, and patient-specific physiological variability, suggesting that current models primarily exploit glucose autocorrelation.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This analysis has significant clinical impact by highlighting a fundamental limitation in current blood glucose forecasting, which could lead to suboptimal diabetes management tools. By advocating for models that genuinely leverage physiological drivers, it pushes for the development of more effective, personalized, and robust predictive systems crucial for real-time decision-making in diabetes care. It also provides a framework for evaluating model utility beyond raw predictive accuracy, focusing on clinical interpretability and actionable insights.</p>

                <p>The identified limitations are inherent to current deep sequence modeling approaches and data environments: 1) Architectural biases (C1) in deep models that prioritize autoregressive patterns over external causal inputs. 2) Data fidelity gaps (C2) where driver data (insulin, meals, activity) are often noisy, inconsistently collected, or confounded. 3) The challenge of physiological heterogeneity (C3) among individuals, making population-level models less effective without personalization.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.</p>
