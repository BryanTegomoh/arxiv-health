                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the "Driver-Blindness phenomenon," observing that deep sequence models for blood glucose (BG) forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers like insulin, meals, and activity. It formalizes this failure using $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, the performance gain from multivariate models over univariate baselines, which is typically near zero in the literature. The authors attribute Driver-Blindness to architectural biases favoring autocorrelation, data fidelity gaps, and physiological heterogeneity, while synthesizing strategies for partial mitigation and recommending routine reporting of $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Driver-Blindness Phenomenon:** Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to utilize clinically relevant physiological drivers (insulin, meals, activity) despite their known impact on BG.</li>
                    
                    <li>**$Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ Metric:** This failure is quantified by $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, defined as the performance improvement of multivariate models (incorporating drivers) compared to matched univariate baselines (using only historical BG data).</li>
                    
                    <li>**Prevalence of Failure:** Across existing research, $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ is typically found to be near zero, indicating that incorporating drivers often provides no significant performance benefit.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Three Interacting Causes:** Driver-Blindness is attributed to (C1) architectural biases in deep sequence models that favor autocorrelation, (C2) data fidelity gaps that render physiological drivers noisy or confounded, and (C3) high physiological heterogeneity among individuals that challenges population-level models.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Mitigation Strategies:** The paper synthesizes strategies that have shown partial success in mitigating Driver-Blindness, including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization techniques, and personalized modeling approaches.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Recommendation for Research Standard:** It is recommended that future work routinely report $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ to ensure that models truly leveraging physiological drivers are recognized as state-of-the-art, preventing driver-blind models from being misclassified.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper employs a conceptual and synthesis approach, formalizing a novel phenomenon ("Driver-Blindness") and introducing a quantitative metric ($Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$) based on an analysis and synthesis of findings from existing literature. It identifies and categorizes the underlying causal factors contributing to this phenomenon and consolidates known mitigation strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Deep sequence models widely used for blood glucose forecasting are 'Driver-Blind,' consistently failing to effectively leverage crucial physiological inputs. The performance gain from incorporating these drivers ($Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$) is negligible, primarily due to architectural biases towards autocorrelation, poor data fidelity of driver information, and significant inter-individual physiological variability. Current strategies only offer partial solutions to this fundamental limitation.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This analysis can guide the development of next-generation blood glucose forecasting models that are genuinely physiologically informed, leading to more accurate, reliable, and interpretable predictions. Such models would significantly enhance decision support for individuals with diabetes and their healthcare providers, potentially leading to improved glycemic control, reduced risk of complications, and better overall quality of life.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract itself implies that current mitigation strategies only 'partially mitigate' Driver-Blindness, suggesting that a complete and robust solution remains an open challenge. The paper is a conceptual synthesis and review rather than an experimental study, meaning its findings are based on an analysis of the broader literature's limitations rather than new empirical data from a novel model.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on developing advanced models that effectively leverage physiological drivers through techniques like physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization. Crucially, all future studies in blood glucose forecasting should routinely report $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ to objectively evaluate the true contribution of incorporating physiological drivers and ensure valid comparisons of state-of-the-art models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.</p>
