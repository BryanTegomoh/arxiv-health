                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper identifies and formalizes the "Driver-Blindness Phenomenon" in deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting, where models consistently fail to leverage crucial physiological drivers like insulin, meals, and activity. It quantifies this failure using a metric $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ and attributes it to architectural biases, data fidelity gaps, and physiological heterogeneity, while synthesizing strategies to mitigate this issue.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate blood glucose forecasting is vital for effective diabetes management, enabling proactive interventions and personalized treatment. Models that ignore known physiological drivers limit the potential for precision medicine and may lead to suboptimal clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper directly addresses the application of deep sequence models (a form of AI) for predicting future blood glucose levels. This application is vital for personalized diabetes management, enabling patients and healthcare providers to make informed decisions about insulin dosage, meal planning, and activity levels to prevent hypo- or hyperglycemia. The research aims to improve the effectiveness and clinical utility of AI tools in supporting better health outcomes for individuals managing their blood glucose.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Driver-Blindness Phenomenon**: Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting largely ignore clinically informative physiological drivers (insulin, meals, activity), despite their known mechanistic roles.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Formalization with $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$**: The phenomenon is formalized by $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$, representing the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines that only use historical glucose data.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Prevalence of Driver-Blindness**: Across existing literature, $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ is typically found to be near zero, indicating that models predominantly rely on autocorrelation patterns rather than driver inputs.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Attributed Causes**: Three interacting factors are identified as primary causes: (C1) architectural biases in deep learning models favoring temporal autocorrelation, (C2) data fidelity gaps leading to noisy and confounded driver data, and (C3) significant physiological heterogeneity among individuals, undermining population-level models.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Mitigation Strategies**: The paper synthesizes strategies to partially overcome Driver-Blindness, including the use of physiological feature encoders, causal regularization techniques, and personalization approaches.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Call for New Evaluation Metric**: Future research is recommended to routinely report $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ to prevent models that are effectively 'driver-blind' from being mislabeled as state-of-the-art based solely on overall performance metrics.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Focus on Causality**: The underlying issue is the models' failure to learn causal relationships between drivers and glucose levels, instead opting for simpler correlational patterns.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The paper employs a conceptual analysis and synthesis approach, formalizing the "Driver-Blindness" phenomenon and introducing the $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ metric. It reviews existing literature on deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting to identify common failures, analyze underlying causes (architectural biases, data quality, physiological variability), and synthesize potential mitigation strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently exhibit "Driver-Blindness," meaning they do not effectively leverage clinically important inputs (insulin, meals, activity). This is quantified by $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ values near zero in the literature, indicating models default to autocorrelation. The core reasons are architectural biases towards autocorrelation, noisy/confounded driver data, and inter-individual physiological heterogeneity.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By highlighting the failure of current models to utilize crucial physiological information, this research encourages the development of more physiologically grounded and causally aware forecasting tools. Such improved models could lead to significantly better personalized diabetes management, more precise insulin dosing, reduced hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events, and overall enhanced quality of life for individuals with diabetes.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The paper implicitly addresses limitations inherent in the current state of deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting: (C1) their architectural predisposition to rely on autocorrelation rather than causal drivers, (C2) challenges with collecting high-fidelity, unconfounded physiological driver data, and (C3) the difficulty of building generalizable models due to significant inter-individual physiological variability.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on developing models that incorporate physiological feature encoders, implement causal regularization techniques, and utilize personalization strategies to better leverage driver data. It is also recommended that all future work in this domain routinely report the $Δ_{	ext{drivers}}$ metric to accurately assess the models' ability to use clinically relevant drivers.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.</p>
