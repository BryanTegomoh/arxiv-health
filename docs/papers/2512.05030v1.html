                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network for accurate, insole-based estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs). The network integrates anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors with a region-level attention mechanism and a complementary path for full sensor context. It demonstrates superior performance over strong baselines, achieving significantly lower normalized root mean square errors on both an insole dataset and a public walking dataset, proving robust performance for GRF/GRM estimation.</p>

                    <p>The study proposes a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network.

Both paths are trained jointly, and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.</p>
