                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network. This deep learning architecture is designed with two parallel processing paths: one path integrates anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors through a region-level attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on relevant foot regions and their temporal dynamics. The other complementary path concurrently captures context from the full sensor field, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of pressure distribution. Both paths are jointly trained, and their outputs are combined to generate the final three-dimensional GRF/GRM predictions. The method was evaluated using data collected from pressure-sensing insoles and validated on a publicly available walking dataset.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.</p>
