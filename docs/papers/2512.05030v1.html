                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network for accurate, insole-based estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces (GRFs) and moments (GRMs), vital for biomechanics and clinical rehabilitation. The network leverages anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors through a region-level attention mechanism alongside a complementary path capturing full sensor field context. The model demonstrates robust performance, outperforming strong CNN and CNN-LSTM baselines on two datasets with impressive normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) metrics.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network, a deep learning architecture. One path incorporates anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, focusing on specific foot regions.

Both paths are trained jointly, and their respective outputs are combined to yield the final GRF/GRM regression predictions. The model's performance was validated against CNN and CNN-LSTM baselines on an insole dataset and a public walking dataset, using Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) as the primary evaluation metric.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.</p>
