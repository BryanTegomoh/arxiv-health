                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network for accurate, insole-based estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs). The proposed deep learning model integrates anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors with a region-level attention mechanism, complemented by a path capturing full sensor field context. It significantly outperforms traditional CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, demonstrating robust performance critical for biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network. One path employs a region-level attention mechanism, integrating anatomy-inspired spatial and temporal priors to process sensor data from specific foot regions. A second, complementary path captures global context from the entire sensor field. Both paths are trained simultaneously, and their respective outputs are fused to generate the final GRF/GRM predictions. The method is applied to insole-based sensor data and validated on two distinct datasets.</p>

                    <p>The Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network significantly outperforms strong baseline models (CNN and CNN-LSTM) across two datasets. It achieved the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset. For the vertical ground reaction force (a critical component), it achieved an NRMSE of 1.42% on a public walking dataset. These results demonstrate robust and superior accuracy for estimating GRFs and GRMs.</p>

                <p>This improved accuracy in GRF/GRM estimation using readily deployable insole sensors can revolutionize clinical rehabilitation. It allows for more objective and precise assessment of gait mechanics, functional recovery, and treatment efficacy. This enables clinicians to tailor rehabilitation protocols, monitor patient progress in real-world settings, and identify subtle deviations in movement patterns indicative of injury risk or pathology, leading to better patient outcomes and personalized care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.</p>
