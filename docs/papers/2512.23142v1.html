                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper reveals that deep deformable registration models possess an inherent immunity to domain shift, a property stemming from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global image appearance. They introduce UniReg, a framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation, demonstrating robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to traditional methods, even when trained on a single dataset, while attributing conventional CNN failures to early layer biases.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Deformable image registration is fundamental in medical imaging for tasks like treatment planning, image-guided interventions, and disease progression monitoring. Achieving domain-shift immunity means deep learning models can be more reliably applied across diverse patient populations, different scanner types, and varying imaging modalities (e.g., MRI to CT), significantly broadening their clinical utility without requiring extensive re-training or data collection.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a framework (UniReg) and insights into making AI-powered medical image registration more robust and generalizable across different imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, PET) and diverse clinical datasets.

                    <p>The study introduces UniReg, a universal registration framework designed to decouple feature extraction from deformation estimation. It utilizes fixed, pre-trained feature extractors to generate local feature representations, which are then fed into a UNet-based deformation network for estimating the deformation field.

Additionally, an analysis was conducted to pinpoint the causes of modality shift failures in conventional CNN-based registration models.</p>

UniReg, leveraging this principle, achieves robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance, matching traditional optimization methods despite single-dataset training.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.</p>
