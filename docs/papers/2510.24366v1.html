                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher
and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel
switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy
under limited supervision.</p>
