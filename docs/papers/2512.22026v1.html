                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a virtual imaging simulation framework. A validated CT simulator (DukeSim) generated photon-counting CT projections of a computational head model, which were then reconstructed. Proton therapy plans (2 Gy for nasal/brain tumors) were created. A 'ground truth' plan was established directly on the computational model. SPR values were estimated from the reconstructed CT images using both a conventional stoichiometric approach and the prototype TissueXplorer software. The ground truth plan was then recalculated using SPRs from both methods, and the resulting dose distributions were quantitatively compared against the ground truth to assess accuracy.</p>

                <p>This research suggests that integrating spectral CT data, through advanced software like TissueXplorer, could significantly enhance the accuracy of proton therapy planning by reducing beam range uncertainty. This has the potential to enable more conformal dose delivery to tumors, improve tumor control probability, and minimize toxicity to critical organs at risk, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes for patients undergoing proton therapy for brain or head and neck cancers.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this work, we proposed virtual imaging simulators as an alternative approach to experimental validation of beam range uncertainty in complex patient geometry using a computational model of a human head and a photon-counting CT scanner. We validate the accuracy of stopping power ratio (SPR) calculations using a conventional stoichiometric calibration approach and a prototype software, TissueXplorer. A validated CT simulator (DukeSim) was used to generate photon-counting CT projections of a computational head model, which were reconstructed with an open-source toolbox (ASTRA). The dose of 2 Gy was delivered through protons in a single fraction to target two different cases of nasal and brain tumors with a single lateral beam angle. Ground truth treatment plan was made directly on the computational head model using clinical treatment planning software (RayStation). This plan was then recalculated on the corresponding CT images for which SPR values were estimated using both the conventional method and the prototype software TissueXplorer. The mean percentage difference in estimating the stopping power ratio with TissueXplorer in all head tissues inside the scanned volume was 0.28%. Stopping power ratios obtained with this method showed smaller dose distribution differences from the ground truth plan than the conventional stoichiometric calibration method on the computational head model. Virtual imaging offers an alternative approach to validation of the SPR prediction from CT imaging, as well as its effect on the dose distribution and thus downstream clinical outcomes. According to this simulation study, software solutions that utilize spectral information, such as TissueXplorer, hold promise for more accurate prediction of the stopping power ratio than the conventional stoichiometric approach.</p>
