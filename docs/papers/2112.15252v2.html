                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces IDSIM, a native Windows desktop application developed by Ontario Tech University and the Durham Region Health Department, designed for in-house epidemiological modeling of infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19. The app utilizes a multi-stratified compartmental model to simulate various virus variants, vaccination levels, and public health measures. Key findings include the necessity of both natural and vaccination-induced immunity for Delta variant herd immunity, the impact of waning immunity on achieving it, and predictions for an Omicron wave's significant challenges and peak timing based on booster dose administration.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides local public health units with an essential in-house tool for real-time epidemiological forecasting and scenario planning, directly supporting evidence-based decision-making for resource allocation, vaccination strategies, and implementation of public health interventions during pandemics.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a computational desktop application that implements a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model. While this is a sophisticated mathematical modeling approach used for health applications, it is not explicitly stated to leverage artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning, deep learning) in its core methodology. It represents a computational tool for health modeling and simulation, which is foundational for many AI applications in health but isn't an AI application itself in the strict sense.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>For the Delta variant, achieving herd immunity necessitates a combination of natural immunity acquired from infection and vaccination-induced immunity. Waning vaccine-induced immunity significantly extends the timeframe required to reach herd immunity. Furthermore, without additional public health measures, an Omicron variant wave is projected to cause significant public health challenges, with predicted infection peaks occurring within two to three months, a duration influenced by the rate of booster dose administration.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The IDSIM app offers public health departments a powerful, localized forecasting tool to proactively model disease transmission and potential outcomes. This enables strategic planning for vaccination campaigns, optimal allocation of healthcare resources (e.g., hospital beds, staffing), and timely implementation or adjustment of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, physical distancing), ultimately aiming to mitigate infection rates and severe disease burden.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, as an epidemiological model, its accuracy and predictive power are inherently dependent on the quality and completeness of input data, as well as the underlying assumptions of the compartmental model. Predictions, especially for future waves like Omicron, are scenario-dependent (e.g., "in the absence of additional public health measures") and subject to change with evolving viral characteristics or human behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented demands on local public health units in Ontario, Canada, one of which was the need for in-house epidemiological-modelling capabilities. To address this need, Ontario Tech University and the Durham Region Health Department developed a native Windows desktop app that performs epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases. The app is an implementation of a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model that can accommodate multiple virus variants and levels of vaccination, as well as public health measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing followed by quarantine, and testing followed by isolation. This article presents the epidemiological model and epidemiological-simulation results obtained using the developed app. The simulations investigate the effects of different factors on COVID-19 transmission in Durham Region, including vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, waning of vaccine-induced immunity, advent of the Omicron variant and effect of COVID-19 booster vaccines in reducing the number of infections and severe cases. Results indicate that, for the Delta variant, natural immunity, in addition to vaccination-induced immunity, is necessary to achieve herd immunity and that waning of vaccine-induced immunity lengthens the time necessary to reach herd immunity. In the absence of additional public health measures, a wave driven by the Omicron variant is predicted to pose significant public health challenges with infections predicted to peak in approximately two to three months, depending on the rate of administration of booster doses.</p>
