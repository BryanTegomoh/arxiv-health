                    <p>The study utilized IDSIM, a native Windows desktop application that implements a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model. This model is designed to simulate infectious disease transmission by accommodating multiple virus variants, different levels of vaccination, and various public health measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing followed by quarantine, and testing followed by isolation.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Key findings indicate that for the Delta variant, achieving herd immunity necessitates both natural immunity acquired from infection and vaccination-induced immunity, with waning vaccine immunity extending this timeline. For the Omicron variant, a significant wave is predicted to emerge, peaking in approximately two to three months in the absence of additional public health measures, with the rate of booster dose administration influencing the peak timing and severity of infections.</p>

                <p>The IDSIM app offers local public health units an invaluable in-house resource for data-driven decision-making, enabling proactive planning and targeted interventions. Its predictions for variant-specific waves, like Omicron, can inform resource allocation (e.g., hospital capacity, testing supplies), optimize booster vaccine campaigns, and guide the timely implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate disease burden and severe outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented demands on local public health units in Ontario, Canada, one of which was the need for in-house epidemiological-modelling capabilities. To address this need, Ontario Tech University and the Durham Region Health Department developed a native Windows desktop app that performs epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases. The app is an implementation of a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model that can accommodate multiple virus variants and levels of vaccination, as well as public health measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing followed by quarantine, and testing followed by isolation. This article presents the epidemiological model and epidemiological-simulation results obtained using the developed app. The simulations investigate the effects of different factors on COVID-19 transmission in Durham Region, including vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, waning of vaccine-induced immunity, advent of the Omicron variant and effect of COVID-19 booster vaccines in reducing the number of infections and severe cases. Results indicate that, for the Delta variant, natural immunity, in addition to vaccination-induced immunity, is necessary to achieve herd immunity and that waning of vaccine-induced immunity lengthens the time necessary to reach herd immunity. In the absence of additional public health measures, a wave driven by the Omicron variant is predicted to pose significant public health challenges with infections predicted to peak in approximately two to three months, depending on the rate of administration of booster doses.</p>
