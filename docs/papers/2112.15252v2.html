                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces IDSIM, a native Windows desktop application developed for in-house epidemiological modeling of infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19. It implements a multi-stratified compartmental model capable of simulating various virus variants, vaccination levels, and public health interventions, providing critical insights into transmission dynamics for local public health units. The research presents simulation results for Durham Region, Canada, highlighting the effects of immunity waning, variant emergence, and booster campaigns on COVID-19 transmission.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly medically relevant by providing a practical, accessible, and in-house epidemiological modeling tool for local public health units, enabling rapid, data-driven decision-making for pandemic response, resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes a 'native Windows desktop app that performs epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases' to investigate factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and predict future trends. While the underlying 'multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model' might not utilize advanced machine learning or deep learning algorithms commonly associated with modern AI, it is a computational application designed for forecasting, simulation, and decision support in a medical and public health context. This falls under the broader umbrella of AI/computational applications in health, as it provides data-driven insights and predictions to inform public health strategies and medical interventions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a native Windows desktop application, IDSIM, which implements a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model. This model was designed to simulate infectious disease transmission by accommodating factors such as multiple virus variants, different levels of vaccination coverage and effectiveness, waning vaccine-induced immunity, and various public health measures (e.g., physical distancing, contact tracing followed by quarantine, testing followed by isolation). Simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of these factors on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the Durham Region.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Key findings include that for the Delta variant, achieving herd immunity required a combination of natural and vaccine-induced immunity, and waning vaccine immunity extended the time to reach herd immunity. For the Omicron variant, a significant wave was predicted to emerge, posing substantial public health challenges, with infections peaking in approximately two to three months, contingent on the rate of booster vaccine administration and assuming no additional public health measures.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The IDSIM app offers a vital in-house capability for local public health units to rapidly model complex infectious disease scenarios, facilitating timely and localized assessments of vaccination strategies, the potential impact of new variants, and the effectiveness of various public health interventions. This directly informs evidence-based resource allocation, guides policy decisions for booster campaigns, and refines public health messaging, ultimately helping to mitigate outbreaks, reduce severe cases, and lessen the burden on healthcare systems.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, predictive models inherently rely on assumptions and input data accuracy, which can limit their precision. The prediction for the Omicron variant wave is specified as being "in the absence of additional public health measures," indicating a dependency on specific conditions that may not always hold true in real-world scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented demands on local public health units in Ontario, Canada, one of which was the need for in-house epidemiological-modelling capabilities. To address this need, Ontario Tech University and the Durham Region Health Department developed a native Windows desktop app that performs epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases. The app is an implementation of a multi-stratified compartmental epidemiological model that can accommodate multiple virus variants and levels of vaccination, as well as public health measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing followed by quarantine, and testing followed by isolation. This article presents the epidemiological model and epidemiological-simulation results obtained using the developed app. The simulations investigate the effects of different factors on COVID-19 transmission in Durham Region, including vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, waning of vaccine-induced immunity, advent of the Omicron variant and effect of COVID-19 booster vaccines in reducing the number of infections and severe cases. Results indicate that, for the Delta variant, natural immunity, in addition to vaccination-induced immunity, is necessary to achieve herd immunity and that waning of vaccine-induced immunity lengthens the time necessary to reach herd immunity. In the absence of additional public health measures, a wave driven by the Omicron variant is predicted to pose significant public health challenges with infections predicted to peak in approximately two to three months, depending on the rate of administration of booster doses.</p>
