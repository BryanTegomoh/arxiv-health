                    <p>The abstract outlines the research's scope and methodology but does not present specific key findings or results. It describes an ongoing investigation into lexical errors within machine translation rather than reporting the discovered error types, frequencies, or their impact.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Improving lexical accuracy in machine translation of medical texts holds significant clinical impact by enhancing the accessibility and reliability of vital health information for non-English speaking patients and healthcare providers. This can lead to safer medication use, better adherence to treatment regimens, and more informed health decisions, particularly crucial during pandemics or for globally distributed health initiatives.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by
Machine Translation from English into Romanian, and it focuses on lexical
errors found in texts which include official information, provided by the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Organization, by the patient information
leaflet (the information about the active ingredients of the vaccines or the
medication, the indications, the dosage instructions, the storage instructions,
the side effects and warning, etc.). All of these texts are related to Covid-19
and have been translated by Google Translate, a multilingual Machine
Translation that was created by Google. In the last decades, Google has
actively worked to develop a more accurate and fluent automatic translation
system. This research, specifically focused on improving Google Translate, aims
to enhance the overall quality of Machine Translation by achieving better
lexical selection and by reducing errors. The investigation involves a
comprehensive analysis of 230 texts that have been translated from English into
Romanian.</p>
