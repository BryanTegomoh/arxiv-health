                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by
Machine Translation from English into Romanian, and it focuses on lexical
errors found in texts which include official information, provided by the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Organization, by the patient information
leaflet (the information about the active ingredients of the vaccines or the
medication, the indications, the dosage instructions, the storage instructions,
the side effects and warning, etc.). All of these texts are related to Covid-19
and have been translated by Google Translate, a multilingual Machine
Translation that was created by Google. In the last decades, Google has
actively worked to develop a more accurate and fluent automatic translation
system. This research, specifically focused on improving Google Translate, aims
to enhance the overall quality of Machine Translation by achieving better
lexical selection and by reducing errors. The investigation involves a
comprehensive analysis of 230 texts that have been translated from English into
Romanian.</p>
