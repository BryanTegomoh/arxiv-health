                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The RADAR system employs AI agents that leverage a retrieval-augmented approach. External medical knowledge, comprising case reports and literature, is first processed by embedding it using sentence transformers. This embedded knowledge is then indexed with FAISS, enabling efficient similarity search. During diagnostic reasoning, these agents retrieve contextually relevant evidence from the indexed knowledge base to guide decision-making. The system is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing integration with various large language models to enhance their rare pathology recognition capabilities without the need for additional training.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence
conditions in medical imaging.</p>
