                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Spatiotemporal Emission Reconstruction from Prompt-Gamma Timing (SER-PGT) as a promising method to monitor proton therapy in real-time, providing crucial insights into particle range and stopping power. Initial experimental results, using a 226.9 MeV proton beam on a homogeneous phantom at sub-clinical intensity, demonstrate the feasibility of SER-PGT. The method achieved an 8% error in stopping power estimation and successfully identified range shifts with a 3 mm standard deviation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Proton therapy's full potential is limited by uncertainties that prevent optimal dose distribution. Monitoring techniques can reduce these uncertainties and enable adaptive treatment planning. Spatiotemporal Emission Reconstruction from Prompt-Gamma Timing (SER-PGT) is a promising method that provides insights into both particle range and stopping power, whose calculation would normally require knowledge about patient tissue properties that cannot be directly measured. We present the first experimental results using a 226.9 MeV synchrotron-proton beam impinging on a homogeneous phantom at a sub-clinical intensity (2 - 4 x 10^7 pps). SER-PGT uses data from a multi-detector setup: a thin and segmented Low Gain Avalanche Diode for proton detection and Lanthanum Bromide-based crystals for photon detection. The estimated stopping power profile showed an 8% +- 3% average error compared to NIST PSTAR values, and 2% +- 2% deviation relative to water at 100 MeV. Range assessment in a phantom with a 4 cm air-gap successfully identified the range shift with a 3 mm standard deviation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SER-PGT to recover both range and stopping power information through particle kinematics and PGT measurements.</p>
