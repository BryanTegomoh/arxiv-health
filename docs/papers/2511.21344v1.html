                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The successful demonstration of SER-PGT's feasibility for real-time monitoring of stopping power and range has significant clinical impact. It could enable more precise and adaptive proton therapy by allowing clinicians to verify dose delivery in-vivo, correct for patient motion or anatomical changes, and reduce treatment uncertainties. This precision is vital for maximizing tumor control while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy organs, potentially leading to improved therapeutic ratios and fewer treatment-related toxicities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Proton therapy's full potential is limited by uncertainties that prevent optimal dose distribution. Monitoring techniques can reduce these uncertainties and enable adaptive treatment planning. Spatiotemporal Emission Reconstruction from Prompt-Gamma Timing (SER-PGT) is a promising method that provides insights into both particle range and stopping power, whose calculation would normally require knowledge about patient tissue properties that cannot be directly measured. We present the first experimental results using a 226.9 MeV synchrotron-proton beam impinging on a homogeneous phantom at a sub-clinical intensity (2 - 4 x 10^7 pps). SER-PGT uses data from a multi-detector setup: a thin and segmented Low Gain Avalanche Diode for proton detection and Lanthanum Bromide-based crystals for photon detection. The estimated stopping power profile showed an 8% +- 3% average error compared to NIST PSTAR values, and 2% +- 2% deviation relative to water at 100 MeV. Range assessment in a phantom with a 4 cm air-gap successfully identified the range shift with a 3 mm standard deviation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SER-PGT to recover both range and stopping power information through particle kinematics and PGT measurements.</p>
