                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper extends the Causal Additive Model (CAM) to explicitly learn higher-order causal interactions, which are prevalent in complex real-world systems but often overlooked in causal discovery. It introduces the Directed Acyclic Hypergraph (hyper-DAG) as a novel representational structure for these interactions, providing theoretical tools, identifiability results, and an adapted greedy algorithm for its discovery, demonstrating improved empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Many biological and health processes involve complex interactions (e.g., gene-gene, gene-environment, drug-drug interactions, multi-protein complexes in disease pathways) that are crucial for understanding etiology, progression, and treatment response. This framework provides a more powerful tool to uncover these higher-order causal mechanisms, which are often missed by traditional pairwise causal models, leading to more accurate biological insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.</p>
