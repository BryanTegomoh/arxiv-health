                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel weakly supervised method for segmenting vertebral metastases (both lytic and blastic) in CT scans, trained exclusively on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels without requiring expensive voxel-level annotations. By combining a Diffusion Autoencoder for classifier-guided healthy edits with a unique "Hide-and-Seek Attribution" mechanism to identify truly malignant regions, the method achieves strong segmentation performance, significantly outperforming baselines and demonstrating the feasibility of generating reliable lesion masks from coarse labels.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The method begins with a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE) trained to produce a classifier-guided 'healthy edit' of each vertebra, effectively removing malignant features. Pixel-wise difference maps between the original and edited images generate initial candidate lesion regions. To confirm malignancy, a novel "Hide-and-Seek Attribution" technique is employed: each candidate region is revealed sequentially while others are hidden. The modified image is then projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that specific component. High-scoring regions are aggregated to form the final lytic or blastic segmentation masks.</p>

                    <p>The study's key finding is that its weakly supervised method successfully generated highly accurate segmentation masks for both blastic (F1: 0.91, Dice: 0.87) and lytic (F1: 0.85, Dice: 0.78) vertebral metastases, despite being trained solely on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels. This performance significantly surpassed established baselines, validating that generative editing combined with selective occlusion can effectively transform coarse supervision into reliable pixel-level annotations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate segmentation of vertebral metastasis in CT is clinically important yet difficult to scale, as voxel-level annotations are scarce and both lytic and blastic lesions often resemble benign degenerative changes. We introduce a weakly supervised method trained solely on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels, without any lesion masks. The method combines a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE) that produces a classifier-guided healthy edit of each vertebra with pixel-wise difference maps that propose candidate lesion regions. To determine which regions truly reflect malignancy, we introduce Hide-and-Seek Attribution: each candidate is revealed in turn while all others are hidden, the edited image is projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that component. High-scoring regions form the final lytic or blastic segmentation. On held-out radiologist annotations, we achieve strong blastic/lytic performance despite no mask supervision (F1: 0.91/0.85; Dice: 0.87/0.78), exceeding baselines (F1: 0.79/0.67; Dice: 0.74/0.55). These results show that vertebra-level labels can be transformed into reliable lesion masks, demonstrating that generative editing combined with selective occlusion supports accurate weakly supervised segmentation in CT.</p>
