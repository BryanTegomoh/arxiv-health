                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research addresses the challenge of psychiatric comorbidity by developing a novel, clinically-grounded approach to generate a large-scale diagnostic dialogue dataset. They constructed 502 synthetic Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for common comorbid conditions and then used a multi-agent framework, mimicking clinical interview protocols, to generate 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues, validated by psychiatrists. The resulting dataset, PsyCoTalk, is the first to support comorbidity and aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning by enabling the development of AI models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the successful creation of PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset (3,000 multi-turn dialogues) specifically designed to address psychiatric comorbidity. This dataset demonstrates high structural and linguistic fidelity to real-world clinical transcripts and has been confirmed by licensed psychiatrists for its realism and diagnostic validity. It effectively supports complex multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a conversational format.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This dataset and approach have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy for complex comorbid psychiatric conditions. It can facilitate the development of AI-powered diagnostic assistants that can screen for multiple disorders in a single patient interaction, leading to earlier and more comprehensive diagnoses, improved treatment planning, and more efficient use of clinical resources in mental healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated as limitations, the dataset is based on *synthetic* EMRs and dialogues. Although validated by psychiatrists for realism and fidelity, synthetic data inherently carries the potential for subtle biases or omissions compared to extremely diverse and unpredictable real-world patient interactions. The abstract does not detail the specific types or ranges of psychiatric comorbidities covered, which could be a nuanced limitation depending on the scope.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.</p>
