                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Early cancer detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, and 18F FDG
PET/CT imaging plays a vital role by combining metabolic and anatomical
information. Accurate lesion detection remains challenging due to the need to
identify multiple lesions of varying sizes. In this study, we investigate the
effect of adding anatomy prior information to deep learning-based lesion
detection models. In particular, we add organ segmentation masks from the
TotalSegmentator tool as auxiliary inputs to provide anatomical context to
nnDetection, which is the state-of-the-art for lesion detection, and Swin
Transformer. The latter is trained in two stages that combine self-supervised
pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The method is tested in the AutoPET
and Karolinska lymphoma datasets. The results indicate that the inclusion of
anatomical priors substantially improves the detection performance within the
nnDetection framework, while it has almost no impact on the performance of the
vision transformer. Moreover, we observe that Swin Transformer does not offer
clear advantages over conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders
used in nnDetection. These findings highlight the critical role of the
anatomical context in cancer lesion detection, especially in CNN-based models.</p>
