                    <p>CROT is an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm. It is specifically engineered to handle 'patch-based' missing data patterns, rather than random missingness, in tabular, heterogeneous, and high-dimensional single-cell datasets. The methodology leverages optimal transport theory, likely incorporating cluster regularization (as suggested by the title), to effectively capture and utilize the inherent structure of the data for more accurate and efficient imputation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis.
