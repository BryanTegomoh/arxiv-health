                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel continual learning framework, integrating a Dual-LoRA architecture with Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay, to address catastrophic forgetting in large multimodal models (LMMs) used for food analysis. The approach enables LMMs to learn new food-related tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, crucial for health applications like personalized nutrition and chronic disease prevention. Experiments on the Uni-Food dataset demonstrate superior performance in mitigating forgetting, establishing the first effective continual learning method for complex food tasks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Food analysis has become increasingly critical for health-related tasks such as personalized nutrition and chronic disease prevention. However, existing large multimodal models (LMMs) in food analysis suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks, requiring costly retraining from scratch. To address this, we propose a novel continual learning framework for multimodal food learning, integrating a Dual-LoRA architecture with Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay. We introduce two complementary low-rank adapters for each task: a specialized LoRA that learns task-specific knowledge with orthogonal constraints to previous tasks' subspaces, and a cooperative LoRA that consolidates shared knowledge across tasks via pseudo replay. To improve the reliability of replay data, our Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay strategy leverages self-consistency and semantic similarity to reduce hallucinations in generated samples. Experiments on the comprehensive Uni-Food dataset show superior performance in mitigating forgetting, representing the first effective continual learning approach for complex food tasks.</p>
