                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel methodology to analyze the impact of treatment switches in rare diseases, particularly when longitudinal patient data are disjoint due to the use of different measurement instruments over time. It achieves this by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) to map observations into a shared latent space, enabling mixed-effects regression on these aligned representations, and presents a new statistical testing approach for joint parameter estimation. The approach, applied to Spinal Muscular Atrophy, successfully quantifies treatment switch effects and demonstrates its utility for addressing challenges in small data settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Many rare diseases offer limited established treatment options, leading
patients to switch therapies when new medications emerge. To analyze the impact
of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare
disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This,
however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the
observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age
ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the
application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression.
We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned
low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across
instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder
architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time
point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured
through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To
enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach
that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression
and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact
of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our
approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments
for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed
item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for
model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The
results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for
addressing small data challenges.</p>
