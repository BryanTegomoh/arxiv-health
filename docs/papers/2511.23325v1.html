                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper details UNSL's participation in MentalRiskES 2025, Task 1, focusing on Early Risk Detection (ERD) of gambling disorder from social media. Utilizing a CPI+DMC approach with SS3, BERT, and SBERT models combined with historical user analysis, two of their proposals achieved the top two positions in the challenge. Despite this success, the study highlighted challenges in clearly distinguishing between high and low-risk users, underscoring the need for improved data interpretation and more transparent ERD systems.</p>

This suggests that while the models performed well relative to other challenge participants, there remains an inherent difficulty in capturing the subtle nuances required for clear separation of risk levels, possibly due to data quality or the nature of early risk indicators themselves.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Gambling disorder is a complex behavioral addiction that is challenging to understand and address, with severe physical, psychological, and social consequences. Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web has become a key task in the scientific community for identifying early signs of mental health behaviors based on social media activity. This work presents our participation in the MentalRiskES 2025 challenge, specifically in Task 1, aimed at classifying users at high or low risk of developing a gambling-related disorder. We proposed three methods based on a CPI+DMC approach, addressing predictive effectiveness and decision-making speed as independent objectives. The components were implemented using the SS3, BERT with extended vocabulary, and SBERT models, followed by decision policies based on historical user analysis. Although it was a challenging corpus, two of our proposals achieved the top two positions in the official results, performing notably in decision metrics. Further analysis revealed some difficulty in distinguishing between users at high and low risk, reinforcing the need to explore strategies to improve data interpretation and quality, and to promote more transparent and reliable ERD systems for mental disorders.</p>
