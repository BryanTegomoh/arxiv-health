                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning framework that explicitly integrates taxonomic label structures into self-supervised learning for medical imaging. By employing Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) and Level-Aware Margin (LAM) objectives, the approach consistently improves representation quality and ensures better alignment with medical taxonomies across various benchmarks, including breast histopathology. The framework offers a simple and general recipe for learning high-performance and interpretable medical image representations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Medical image diagnosis heavily relies on structured, hierarchical classification (e.g., classifying a lesion from benign to malignant, then to specific subtypes). This method directly addresses this by training models that inherently understand and represent these complex relationships, leading to more accurate, consistent, and clinically interpretable diagnostic results.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is to improve the classification and analysis of medical images, particularly those with hierarchical label structures (e.g., organ - tissue - subtype). This can lead to more accurate and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostic tools for diseases like cancer (as suggested by breast histopathology), enhancing clinical decision-making and patient care.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involves a contrastive learning framework enhanced with two novel plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) and Level-Aware Margin (LAM). HWC dynamically adjusts the weighting of positive and negative training pairs based on the number of shared ancestors in the label hierarchy, promoting within-parent coherence. LAM introduces a prototype margin to enforce clear separation between different ancestor groups at various hierarchical levels. This framework is designed to be geometry-agnostic, enabling its use with both Euclidean and hyperbolic embedding spaces without requiring architectural changes to the neural network.</p>

                    <p>The study's primary findings indicate that the proposed HWC and LAM objectives consistently and significantly improve the quality of learned representations compared to strong self-supervised learning baselines. Crucially, these improvements are accompanied by a demonstrably superior adherence to the underlying medical label taxonomy. Both HWC and LAM proved effective individually, and their combined application yielded the most accurate and taxonomically aligned representations across evaluated benchmarks.</p>

                <p>This research has the potential to significantly enhance the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in medical imaging. By training models that intrinsically recognize and utilize hierarchical diagnostic information, clinicians could benefit from more precise classifications, reduced high-level misdiagnosis rates, and a clearer understanding of model decision-making, particularly in nuanced areas like histopathological grading. This could lead to improved diagnostic accuracy, more efficient clinical workflows, and ultimately better patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in
hierarchy-rich domains.</p>
