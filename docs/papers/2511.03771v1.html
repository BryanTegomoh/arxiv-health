                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning framework for medical imaging, which leverages the inherent taxonomic structure of medical labels (e.g., organ-tissue-subtype) that standard self-supervised learning often overlooks. By incorporating two plug-in objectives, Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), the method consistently improves representation quality over strong baselines, better respects label taxonomies, and enhances both performance and interpretability in hierarchy-rich medical domains like breast histopathology.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning framework. It integrates two novel plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which modifies contrastive loss by scaling positive/negative pair strengths according to the number of shared ancestors, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype-based margin objective to enforce separation of ancestor groups across hierarchical levels. This framework is compatible with existing self-supervised learning architectures and can be applied to both Euclidean and hyperbolic embedding spaces. Model performance is assessed using both standard top-1 accuracy and specialized hierarchy-aware metrics such as HF1, H-Acc, and parent-distance violation rate.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found that the Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) and Level-Aware Margin (LAM) objectives consistently improve the quality of learned representations over strong self-supervised learning baselines. These objectives successfully make the representations more faithful to the underlying label taxonomy, as evidenced by better performance on hierarchy-specific metrics. Furthermore, both HWC and LAM are effective individually, even without hyperbolic embeddings, and their combined application results in the most robust and taxonomy-aligned representations for medical images.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and clinical utility of AI-powered diagnostic tools in medical imaging. By explicitly learning the hierarchical relationships in medical labels, AI models can provide more nuanced and contextually rich predictions, aiding clinicians in differential diagnoses, refining disease staging, and potentially identifying subtle sub-types that are critical for personalized treatment planning. This approach can also increase trust in AI outputs by making them more interpretable and aligned with established medical taxonomies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in
hierarchy-rich domains.</p>
