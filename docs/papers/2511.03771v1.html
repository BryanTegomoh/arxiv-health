                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning framework designed for medical imaging, which explicitly integrates label taxonomies into self-supervised training. It leverages Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) and Level-Aware Margin (LAM) objectives to foster within-parent coherence and inter-level group separation, respectively. The approach consistently improves representation quality and taxonomy faithfulness over strong baselines across various benchmarks, including breast histopathology, advancing both performance and interpretability.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on a hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning framework that augments standard self-supervised learning. It introduces two core objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which adjusts the contribution of positive and negative pairs in the contrastive loss based on the depth of shared ancestors in the label tree, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype-based margin loss that enforces separation between embeddings belonging to different ancestral groups across hierarchical levels. This framework is designed to be geometry-agnostic, allowing its application to various embedding spaces (e.g., Euclidean, hyperbolic) without architectural modifications. Performance is evaluated using both traditional classification accuracy (top-1) and specialized hierarchy-aware metrics such as HF1, H-Acc, and parent-distance violation rate on benchmarks including breast histopathology.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study demonstrates that the Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) and Level-Aware Margin (LAM) objectives consistently yield higher quality representations compared to strong self-supervised learning baselines. These representations not only achieve better overall performance but also exhibit significantly improved faithfulness to the underlying label taxonomy, as quantified by specialized metrics like HF1 and H-Acc, and a reduced parent-distance violation rate. Ablation studies confirm that both HWC and LAM are individually effective, even without the use of curved embedding spaces, and their combined application results in the most robustly taxonomy-aligned representations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential for significant clinical impact by enabling the development of more intelligent and trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging. Models trained with this framework could provide clinicians with diagnoses that are not only accurate but also inherently organized by medical hierarchies, improving interpretability. For example, a model classifying a specific cancer subtype could also automatically provide insights into its broader tissue origin, facilitating better understanding of disease progression, more precise treatment stratification, and potentially reducing diagnostic errors in complex cases like histopathology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in
hierarchy-rich domains.</p>
