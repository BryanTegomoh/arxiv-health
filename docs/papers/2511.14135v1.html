                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Fair-GNE, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages a constrained Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE)-seeking game framework to achieve self-enforceable and certifiably fair workload allocation in multiagent healthcare automation. Unlike existing MARL methods that rely on post-hoc reward shaping, Fair-GNE intrinsically steers group policy to an equitable collective equilibrium, significantly improving workload balance while maintaining high task success in demand-side healthcare worker settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.</p>
