                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The cluster dose concept offers an alternative to the radiobiological
effectiveness (RBE)-based model for describing radiation-induced biological
effects. This study examines the application of a neural network to predict
cluster dose distributions, with the goal of replacing the computationally
intensive simulations currently required. Cluster dose distributions are
predicted using a U-Net that was initially pretrained on conventional dose
distributions. Using transfer learning techniques, the decoder path is adapted
for cluster dose estimation. Both the training and pretraining datasets include
head and neck regions from multiple patients and carbon ion beams of varying
energies and positions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were used to generate the
ground truth cluster dose distributions. The U-Net enables cluster dose
estimation for a single pencil beam within milliseconds using a graphics
processing unit (GPU). The predicted cluster dose distributions deviate from
the ground truth by less than 0.35%. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates
the feasibility of accurately estimating cluster doses within clinically
acceptable computation times using machine learning (ML). By leveraging a
pretrained neural network and applying transfer learning techniques, the
approach significantly reduces the need for large-scale, computationally
expensive training data.</p>
