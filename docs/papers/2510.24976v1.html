                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful architectures in medical
image analysis, excelling in tasks such as disease detection, segmentation, and
classification. However, their reliance on large, attention-driven models makes
them vulnerable to hardware-level attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel
threat model referred to as Med-Hammer that combines the Rowhammer hardware
fault injection with neural Trojan attacks to compromise the integrity of
ViT-based medical imaging systems. Specifically, we demonstrate how malicious
bit flips induced via Rowhammer can trigger implanted neural Trojans, leading
to targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses (e.g.,
tumors or lesions) in medical scans. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
medical imaging datasets such as ISIC, Brain Tumor, and MedMNIST, we show that
such attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates
about 82.51% and 92.56% in MobileViT and SwinTransformer, respectively. We
further investigate how architectural properties, such as model sparsity,
attention weight distribution, and the number of features of the layer, impact
attack effectiveness. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
intersection between hardware-level faults and deep learning security in
healthcare applications, underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses
spanning both model architectures and underlying hardware platforms.</p>
