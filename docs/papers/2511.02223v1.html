                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an LLM-powered data-driven framework for quantitative risk assessment in radiation oncology, automating root cause analysis of safety incident reports. It leverages LLMs to classify incidents into structured taxonomies, followed by statistical methods like Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) and Association Rule Mining (ARM) to identify significant drivers of event severity and systemic vulnerabilities. The study demonstrates that this objective approach can pinpoint high-risk process steps and systemic failures, enabling targeted interventions for patient safety improvements.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Modern large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning that
converts narratives into structured, taxonomy-aligned data, revealing patterns
across planning, delivery, and verification. Embedded as agentic tools, LLMs
can assist root-cause analysis and risk assessment (e.g., failure mode and
effect analysis FMEA), produce auditable rationales, and draft targeted
mitigation actions.
  Methods: We developed a data-driven pipeline utilizing an LLM to perform
automated root cause analysis on 254 institutional safety incidents. The LLM
systematically classified each incident into structured taxonomies for
radiotherapy pathway steps and contributory factors. Subsequent quantitative
analyses included descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA),
multiple Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) analyses to identify predictors of
event severity, and Association Rule Mining (ARM) to uncover systemic
vulnerabilities.
  Results: The high-level Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) models identified
specific, significant drivers of severity. The Pathway model was statistically
significant (Pseudo R2 = 0.033, LR p = 0.015), as was the Responsibility model
(Pseudo R2 = 0.028, LR p < 0.001). Association Rule Mining (ARM) identified
high-confidence systemic rules, such as "CF5 Teamwork, management and
organisational" (n = 8, Conf = 1.0) and the high-frequency link between "(11)
Pre-treatment planning process" and "CF2 Procedural" (n = 152, Conf = 0.916).
  Conclusion: The LLM-powered, data-driven framework provides a more objective
and powerful methodology for risk assessment than traditional approaches. Our
findings empirically demonstrate that interventions focused on fortifying
high-risk process steps and mitigating systemic failures are most effective for
improving patient safety.</p>
