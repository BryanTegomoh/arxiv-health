                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Histology-informed Tiling (HIT), a novel digital pathology method that utilizes semantic segmentation to extract biologically meaningful gland structures from whole slide images (WSIs), rather than relying on arbitrary grid-based tiling. HIT significantly improved the accuracy and interpretability of multiple-instance learning (MIL) models, enabling more precise detection of genetic alterations and the identification of gland clusters strongly associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason scores in prostate cancer.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research offers a more biologically aligned and accurate approach to analyzing digital pathology images, which can lead to earlier and more precise identification of aggressive cancers, improved prognostication, and a deeper understanding of cancer heterogeneity directly from tissue morphology.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves developing a 'histology-informed tiling' (HIT) method using semantic segmentation and multiple-instance learning to analyze whole slide images of cancer tissues. This AI system extracts biologically meaningful structures (glands) to improve the prediction of clinical outcomes such as cancer relapse, detect underlying genetic alterations (e.g., CNVs in EMT and MYC genes), and correlate with established diagnostic markers like the Gleason score. This application provides a more accurate and interpretable AI tool for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and research, potentially aiding pathologists and oncologists in making more informed decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed Histology-informed Tiling (HIT) by training a semantic segmentation model on 137 prostate cancer samples from the ProMPT cohort to precisely identify and extract individual glandular structures from whole slide images (WSIs). The segmentation performance was quantified using a Dice score. Subsequently, 380,000 extracted glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts were used as input for multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. These MIL models were employed to predict copy number variations (CNVs) in specific genes and to cluster glands based on their features, with the resulting clusters analyzed for associations with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and Gleason scores.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>HIT has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in digital pathology, particularly for prostate cancer. By providing a more accurate and interpretable link between microscopic histological features and underlying genetic alterations or clinical outcomes, it could enable earlier and more precise risk stratification, facilitate personalized treatment planning, and enhance the understanding of tumor biology from routine pathology slides. This method offers a standardized, biologically informed framework for extracting clinically relevant information from complex tissue architecture.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state any limitations of the study. Potential general limitations might include the generalizability of the gland segmentation model to highly anaplastic or poorly differentiated cancers where gland structures are less defined, or the dependence on high-quality WSI scans and annotations for training the segmentation model.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.</p>
