                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), an approach that enhances low-rank tensor decomposition to address the computational complexity and low sample efficiency inherent in high-dimensional reinforcement learning. TEQL integrates a novel exploration strategy combining approximation error with visit count-based Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a frequency-based regularization penalty. Empirical results demonstrate TEQL's superior sample efficiency and total rewards compared to conventional matrix-based and deep RL methods, making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications like healthcare.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research contributes to making reinforcement learning (specifically Q-learning) more practical and efficient for high-dimensional, resource-constrained problems in healthcare. It can enable AI systems to learn optimal decision-making policies for complex medical tasks, such as optimizing patient treatment plans, controlling medical devices, or managing critical care situations, especially in scenarios where data sampling (e.g., conducting patient trials, collecting real-time patient data) is expensive, slow, or ethically constrained.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex
calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning
algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the
number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While
neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent
tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more
parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,
we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor
decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action
spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key
innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with
visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high
uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate
a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage
exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to
frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks
demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL
approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for
resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling
costs are high.</p>
