                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study compiled 2,306 multiple-choice questions (text-only) from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were systematically excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format to two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1. Model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Statistical comparisons included Pearson's Chi-squared test for overall performance and Fisher's exact test for year-wise multiple-choice accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The robust performance of DeepSeek-R1 suggests that domain-specific LLMs hold significant potential for enhancing AI-enabled formative evaluation in pharmacy education and professional development, possibly aiding in self-assessment or preparation for licensure exams. However, the study also underscores that for legally and ethically sensitive applications, such as final licensure or direct patient care decisions, human oversight remains absolutely essential to ensure accuracy, accountability, and ethical adherence.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study's primary limitation is the exclusion of questions containing tables or images, meaning the LLMs' ability to process multimodal clinical information was not assessed. It focused solely on multiple-choice questions, which may not fully encompass the diverse range of clinical reasoning and practical application skills required for pharmacist competency. The findings are also specific to the two tested LLMs and the Chinese Pharmacist Exam context.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The authors suggest further investigation into domain-specific models to fully explore their potential in similar high-stakes contexts. Future research should also explore LLM performance on multimodal questions (incorporating images, tables, or complex data), and on more open-ended or complex clinical reasoning tasks to better simulate real-world pharmacist responsibilities. Investigation into LLMs as personalized learning tools or decision support aids within pharmacy practice could also be beneficial.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into digital health education and assessment workflows, their capabilities in supporting high-stakes, domain-specific certification tasks remain underexplored.In China, the national pharmacist licensure exam serves as a standardized benchmark for evaluating pharmacists' clinical and theoretical competencies. Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.</p>
