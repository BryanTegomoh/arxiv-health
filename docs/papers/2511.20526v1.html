                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluated the performance of two large language models, ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, on 2,306 multiple-choice questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021). DeepSeek-R1 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4o (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001), particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules, demonstrating robust alignment with the exam's demands. The findings highlight the potential of domain-specific LLMs for formative evaluation in medical contexts while reinforcing the necessity of human oversight.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a comparative design, assessing ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 against a dataset of 2,306 multiple-choice, text-only questions from the 2017-2021 Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination. Questions were input in their original Chinese format, and model responses were scored for exact accuracy. Statistical analyses included Pearson's Chi-squared test for overall performance comparison and Fisher's exact test for year-wise multiple-choice accuracy differences.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated a significantly superior overall accuracy of 90.0% compared to ChatGPT-4o's 76.1% (p < 0.001). DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperformed ChatGPT-4o across all unit-level analyses, exhibiting particular strength in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. Although DeepSeek-R1 showed better year-by-year performance, this advantage did not reach statistical significance when analyzed per specific unit-year (all p > 0.05).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The strong performance of DeepSeek-R1 suggests that advanced, potentially domain-specific, LLMs could serve as valuable tools for formative evaluation, continuous professional development, and self-assessment for pharmacists and pharmacy students. However, the study underscores that such AI tools should augment, not replace, human judgment and oversight in legally and ethically critical tasks like professional licensure and clinical decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study's primary limitation is the exclusion of questions containing tables or images, meaning the assessment was restricted to text-only multiple-choice items. This may not fully represent the complexity of real-world clinical scenarios or the multimodal nature of some exam questions, potentially overestimating or underestimating LLM performance on comprehensive assessments.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The authors suggest further investigation into domain-specific models for medical certification contexts. Future research could explore LLM performance on multimodal questions, more complex clinical case studies, and in diverse cultural or linguistic healthcare settings to broaden the understanding of their capabilities and limitations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into digital health education and assessment workflows, their capabilities in supporting high-stakes, domain-specific certification tasks remain underexplored.In China, the national pharmacist licensure exam serves as a standardized benchmark for evaluating pharmacists' clinical and theoretical competencies. Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.</p>
