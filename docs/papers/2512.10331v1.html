                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel network-based SIR epidemic model where disease transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. It rigorously derives the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) based on this operator and proves the global asymptotic stability of both disease-free and endemic equilibria. Critically, the study demonstrates that network curvature acts as a geometric regularizer, effectively lowering spectral radii, raising epidemic thresholds, and organizing long-term disease dynamics.</p>

                <p>This research provides a more sophisticated understanding of how the inherent geometric structure of contact networks can influence disease transmission and control. By demonstrating that network curvature can naturally elevate epidemic thresholds, it offers novel insights into intrinsic network-based resistance mechanisms that can inform public health strategies and intervention design.</p>

                <p>This framework offers a refined tool for epidemic forecasting and intervention planning by considering network geometry beyond simple connectivity. Recognizing that curvature can intrinsically raise epidemic thresholds could guide resource allocation, identifying network regions or populations where disease spread is naturally attenuated.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\fracβγλ_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0<1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0>1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</p>
