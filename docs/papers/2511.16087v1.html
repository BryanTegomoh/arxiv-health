                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">AssayMatch is a novel framework addressing the challenge of noisy, heterogeneous training data in machine learning for drug discovery. It improves model performance by selecting smaller, more homogenous training sets, which are specifically attuned to a target test set, even when the test set's labels are unknown. This method leverages data attribution to finetune language embeddings of assay descriptions, enabling more effective filtering of incompatible experiments and boosting predictive power.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>AssayMatch employs a two-stage approach. First, it uses data attribution methods to quantify the individual contribution of each training assay to the performance of a machine learning model. Second, these attribution scores are utilized to finetune language embeddings derived from text-based assay descriptions. This finetuning process enhances the embeddings to capture not only semantic relatedness but also the empirical compatibility between assays. At test time, these finetuned embeddings are then used to rank and select the most relevant and compatible training data for a given test set, critically enabling selection even when the test set's true labels are unknown.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>AssayMatch significantly enhances the predictive performance of molecular activity models. Models trained on data selected by AssayMatch consistently outperformed models trained on the full, uncurated dataset. The framework effectively filters out noisy or incompatible experiments, leading to increased prediction capability in 9 out of 12 model-target pairs tested across two machine learning architectures when compared to a strong language-only baseline. This indicates improved predictive power and data efficiency for drug discovery tasks.</p>

                <p>The clinical impact is substantial as AssayMatch streamlines and improves the early stages of drug development. By providing higher-quality, more reliable predictive models, it can accelerate the identification of promising drug candidates, reduce experimental costs by minimizing the need for redundant or misleading assays, and ultimately lead to a more efficient pipeline for bringing new therapies to patients. This directly contributes to more focused and successful drug discovery campaigns.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.
