                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding and forecasting precipitation events in the Arctic maritime
environments, such as Bear Island and Ny-{\AA}lesund, is crucial for assessing
climate risk and developing early warning systems in vulnerable marine regions.
This study proposes a probabilistic machine learning framework for modeling and
predicting the dynamics and severity of precipitation. We begin by analyzing
the scale-dependent relationships between precipitation and key atmospheric
drivers (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, and air pressure)
using wavelet coherence, which captures localized dependencies across time and
frequency domains. To assess joint causal influences, we employ
Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition, which quantifies the impact of
interaction effects among each variable on future precipitation dynamics. These
insights inform the development of data-driven forecasting models that
incorporate both historical precipitation and causal climate drivers. To
account for uncertainty, we employ the conformal prediction method, which
enables the generation of calibrated non-parametric prediction intervals. Our
results underscore the importance of utilizing a comprehensive framework that
combines causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of precipitation predictions in Arctic marine
environments.</p>
