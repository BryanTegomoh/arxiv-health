                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This empirical study maps Generative AI (GenAI) adoption, usage, and literacy across 1,906 Italian adults, revealing widespread integration into daily life, including sensitive tasks like medical advice. It highlights GenAI's emergence as a primary information source despite low user digital literacy, posing significant risks of misinformation, and identifies a pronounced gender divide in adoption and usage. The paper underscores an urgent need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into non-competence-based barriers to equitable participation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>The prevalent use of GenAI for sensitive tasks like 'medical advice' by users with low digital literacy presents a significant public health risk, as individuals may receive and act upon inaccurate or misleading health information. This necessitates urgent attention from healthcare providers and policymakers to develop strategies for managing misinformation and promoting safe AI utilization.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper analyzes the *de facto* application of general-purpose generative AI by the public for obtaining 'medical advice' and emotional support. It does not describe a dedicated medical AI application, but rather the current user-driven application of general AI tools in a health context, highlighting the associated risks and societal implications.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This study employed an empirical, quantitative approach using newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. The survey was designed to comprehensively map GenAI adoption rates, specific usage patterns across various tasks (including sensitive ones), and user digital literacy levels within the Italian context.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The research identified widespread GenAI adoption for both work and personal use, including critical applications like emotional support and medical advice. It found that GenAI is becoming a primary information source, supplanting traditional channels, even among users with limited digital literacy who struggle to detect AI-generated errors or misinformation. Furthermore, a significant gender divide was observed, with women, particularly in older demographics, showing markedly lower adoption and usage rates, a disparity only partially explained by literacy levels.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings imply several critical clinical impacts: 1) **Increased Misinformation Risk**: Patients may consult GenAI for self-diagnosis or treatment, receiving erroneous or harmful medical advice, potentially leading to delayed appropriate care, adverse events, or medication errors. 2) **Healthcare Provider Burden**: Clinicians may face an increased burden in addressing patient misconceptions derived from AI, requiring more time for patient education and correcting misinformation. 3) **Health Equity Concerns**: The identified gender divide, especially among older populations, suggests that vulnerable groups may be disproportionately exposed to risks or excluded from potential health benefits of AI due to lower literacy and access. 4) **Policy Imperative**: There is an urgent need for clinical guidelines on the responsible use of AI in patient information, public health campaigns to enhance AI literacy, and regulatory frameworks for AI tools offering health-related content.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study's focus is solely on the Italian context, which may limit the generalizability of findings to other cultures or healthcare systems. It relies on self-reported survey data, which inherently carries a risk of response bias. The abstract does not detail the full demographic scope of the survey beyond gender and age (older generations), which could provide deeper insights into specific population vulnerabilities.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The authors suggest developing targeted educational initiatives to improve GenAI literacy, focusing on users' ability to recognize errors and misinformation. They also call for further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable GenAI participation that extend beyond mere competence, particularly to address the observed gender disparities and other potential socio-economic factors. Additionally, future research should explore the specific types of medical advice sought from GenAI and the real-world impact of acting upon such AI-generated recommendations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) language technologies, particularly generative AI (GenAI) chatbots accessible via conversational interfaces, is transforming digital interactions. While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.</p>
