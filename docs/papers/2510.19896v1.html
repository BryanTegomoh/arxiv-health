                <p>The AI application involves using explainable machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost with SHAP for feature selection) to classify and differentiate bladder cancer from other urological and oncological conditions. This forms the basis for a clinical decision support system aimed at optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical efficiency.</p>

                <p class="abstract">In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.</p>
