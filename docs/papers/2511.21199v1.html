                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research paper introduces a novel model demonstrating that human behavior adaptation, driven by continuously distributed memory of past infection cases, can solely induce sustained, oscillatory epidemic waves. Utilizing advanced numerical methods, the study provides insights into how the shape of the 'memory kernel' and the level of minimal contact influence the period, peak, and stability of these behavior-induced outbreaks, moving beyond previous analytical limitations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding how human behavioral responses independently generate recurrent epidemic waves is critical for public health, enabling more accurate forecasting of outbreaks and informing the design of effective, behavior-centric interventions to mitigate disease spread.</p>

                <p>While the paper uses numerical methods and computational approaches for modeling, it does not describe an AI application itself. It provides foundational insights into disease dynamics and human behavioral responses, which could inform the development of AI models for epidemic forecasting, intervention optimization, or public health communication strategies, but it is not an AI application paper.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a mathematical model for infectious disease transmission incorporating human behavioral adaptation. It analyzes equilibria and their stability both analytically for specific cases and numerically using a recently developed pseudospectral approximation for delay differential equations.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary discovery is that behavior adaptation alone, driven by a distributed memory of past infection cases, is a sufficient mechanism to generate sustained, oscillatory epidemic waves. These waves occur independently of other common drivers like demographic changes, seasonal variations, or waning immunity. Furthermore, the characteristics (period and peak) of these waves are directly influenced by the shape of the memory kernel, and the stability of the endemic equilibrium is significantly affected by the assumed level of minimal contact.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a fundamental understanding of how social behavior can intrinsically drive recurrent epidemic patterns, offering a crucial theoretical basis for public health strategies. Clinically, it informs the development of more effective public health messaging and intervention timing by highlighting the endogenous nature of epidemic waves, helping predict when subsequent waves might occur, and guiding policies aimed at influencing contact rates to stabilize outbreaks and prevent prolonged oscillations.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The model assumes negligible depletion of susceptible individuals, which simplifies the dynamics in certain contexts. To isolate the effect of behavior, the study explicitly excludes other real-world factors such as demographic turnover, seasonality, and waning immunity, meaning its direct applicability to highly complex, multi-factorial real-world scenarios may require further integration of these elements.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, future research could involve integrating the advanced behavioral modeling framework with other critical epidemiological factors (e.g., demographic changes, immune waning, seasonality) to create more comprehensive predictive models. Exploring different forms of memory kernels or incorporating network-based social interactions could also provide further insights into complex epidemic dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</p>
