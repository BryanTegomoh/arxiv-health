                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a mathematical model for infectious disease outbreaks, demonstrating how individuals' adaptive behavior, influenced by continuously distributed past information about new cases, can intrinsically drive epidemic dynamics. Utilizing advanced numerical methods, the study shows that behavior adaptation alone can generate sustained waves of infection, elucidating how the characteristics of the memory kernel and the level of minimal contact impact these oscillations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research offers a fundamental understanding of how human behavioral responses to disease information can intrinsically drive the cyclical nature of epidemics, providing crucial insights for public health strategy development. It suggests that sustained epidemic waves might occur even in the absence of traditional drivers, emphasizing the importance of behavioral factors in disease forecasting and intervention planning.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While this paper primarily employs numerical methods for mathematical modeling rather than developing AI algorithms, its findings are highly relevant for AI applications in health. The insights into behavior-induced epidemic waves, and the methods for analyzing complex dynamic systems, can inform and be integrated into AI-driven epidemiological forecasting models, public health intervention optimization tools, and early warning systems for infectious disease outbreaks. AI/Machine Learning could be used to parameterize such models from real-world behavioral and epidemiological data, or to predict outbreak trajectories based on these complex dynamics.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is that behavior adaptation alone, driven by information about new cases and modeled with a distributed memory, is sufficient to generate sustained, oscillatory waves of infection in an outbreak, independent of demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Furthermore, the period and peak of these behavior-induced waves are critically dependent on the shape parameters of the memory kernel, and the 'level of minimal contact' significantly impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a theoretical framework for understanding the recurring nature of epidemic waves, which can inform the design of more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) by explicitly considering their behavioral impacts. It suggests that sustained public health messaging and adaptive behavioral guidelines are crucial for mitigating disease spread, even when traditional epidemiological factors are not the primary drivers of recurrence. The model's insights could enhance disease forecasting by integrating human behavioral responses more accurately, leading to better preparedness and resource allocation for future outbreaks.</p>

As a theoretical modeling study, direct empirical validation of the specific memory kernel parameters and their real-world impact on epidemic oscillations would be necessary.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</p>
