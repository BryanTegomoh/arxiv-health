                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a mathematical model demonstrating that human behavioral adaptation to information about new infection cases, through a continuously distributed memory kernel, can independently drive sustained oscillations in epidemic outbreaks. Using advanced numerical methods, it shows these behavior-induced waves can occur even without typical drivers like demographics or waning immunity, providing insights into how memory parameters and baseline contact levels influence wave characteristics.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is medically significant because it highlights human behavioral responses to information as an intrinsic driver of epidemic oscillations, offering a crucial framework for understanding and predicting disease dynamics independently of biological or environmental factors. It underscores the importance of public health communication strategies in shaping the course of outbreaks.</p>

                <p>The paper itself is a mathematical modeling study and does not use AI. However, the findings and the type of model developed could inform AI applications in public health, such as AI-driven epidemic forecasting, optimization of public health interventions, or personalized behavioral nudges during outbreaks.</p>

                    <li>The model focuses on an infectious disease outbreak where individuals adapt their behavior based on past information about new cases, assuming negligible depletion of susceptible individuals.</li>
                    
                    <li>Behavioral adaptation is characterized by a continuously distributed memory kernel (following an information index approach) that dictates how individuals react to past information.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study employs a pseudospectral approximation for delay equations, enabling the analysis of memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with general non-integer shape parameters, extending beyond the limitations of the linear chain trick.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilizes mathematical modeling of infectious disease outbreaks incorporating delay differential equations to represent behavior adaptation with a continuously distributed memory kernel. Equilibria and their stability are analyzed, with analytical solutions for selected cases. For comprehensive numerical analysis, especially with gamma distributed memory kernels (including non-integer shape parameters), the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations is employed to study long-term dynamics, moving beyond the traditional linear chain trick.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary discovery is that behavioral adaptation to new case information, even in isolation, can generate sustained, oscillating waves of infection. These oscillations occur independently of demographic changes, seasonality, or waning immunity. Furthermore, the characteristics of these behavior-induced epidemic waves—specifically their period and peak—are directly influenced by the shape and parameters of the memory kernel. The level of minimal contact within the population also plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a critical theoretical foundation for designing more effective public health interventions. Recognizing that behavioral responses can intrinsically drive epidemic waves means that public health campaigns, social distancing guidelines, and information dissemination strategies must consider their potential to induce oscillations. Clinically, this can inform policies aiming to stabilize infection rates, predict future surges based on information flow, and avoid unintended consequences of behavioral guidance that might inadvertently create cyclical outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract notes that the model assumes 'depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible,' which is a simplification that may not accurately reflect all epidemic scenarios, particularly those with high attack rates. As a theoretical modeling study, its findings require empirical validation using real-world epidemiological and behavioral data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</p>
