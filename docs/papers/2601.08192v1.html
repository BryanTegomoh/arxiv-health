                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces R^4, an agentic framework designed to enhance medical image analysis by overcoming the limitations of single-pass, black-box Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding. R^4 decomposes the medical imaging workflow into four coordinated agents—Router, Retriever, Reflector, and Repairer—that iteratively refine free-text reports and bounding box detections. Evaluated on chest X-ray analysis, the framework significantly boosts performance in report generation and weakly supervised detection without requiring gradient-based fine-tuning, making VLMs more reliable for clinical interpretation.</p>

                <p>This research provides a self-improving agentic AI framework (R^4) that enhances the accuracy, reliability, and safety of large vision-language models (VLMs) for interpreting medical images (e.g., chest X-rays) and generating associated diagnostic reports.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The R^4 framework is an agentic system composed of four interacting modules. The Router configures task- and specialization-aware prompts using image, patient history, and metadata. The Retriever generates initial free-text reports and bounding boxes using exemplar memory and pass@k sampling. The Reflector critiques these outputs for six key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, localization errors). Finally, the Repairer iteratively revises the narrative and spatial outputs based on the Reflector's feedback, curating high-quality exemplars in the process. This system was instantiated on chest X-ray analysis using multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection.</p>

                    <p>The R^4 framework consistently demonstrated significant performance improvements over strong single-VLM baselines. It boosted LLM-as-a-Judge scores for report quality by approximately +1.7 to +2.5 points and increased the mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (mAP50) for weakly supervised detection by +2.5 to +3.5 absolute points.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The R^4 framework has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and safety of AI-assisted medical diagnosis and reporting. By explicitly correcting common clinical error modes like negation or laterality errors, it can lead to more reliable diagnostic reports, reduce misinterpretations, and provide better spatial grounding for identified findings. This can aid radiologists in generating more precise reports, streamline workflows, enhance diagnostic confidence, and ultimately contribute to better patient care outcomes and reduced adverse events stemming from AI-generated inaccuracies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image analysis increasingly relies on large vision-language models (VLMs), yet most systems remain single-pass black boxes that offer limited control over reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding. We propose R^4, an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents: a Router that configures task- and specialization-aware prompts from the image, patient history, and metadata; a Retriever that uses exemplar memory and pass@k sampling to jointly generate free-text reports and bounding boxes; a Reflector that critiques each draft-box pair for key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, and localization errors); and a Repairer that iteratively revises both narrative and spatial outputs under targeted constraints while curating high-quality exemplars for future cases. Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning. These results show that agentic routing, reflection, and repair can turn strong but brittle VLMs into more reliable and better grounded tools for clinical image interpretation.
