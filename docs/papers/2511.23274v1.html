                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model), a novel deep learning approach designed to simultaneously improve image quality from under-sampled MRI data and correct for common artefacts like noise and motion. Addressing a critical gap where existing methods tackle either acceleration or artefact correction independently, USArt demonstrates significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and contrast, achieving up to 5x acceleration while maintaining high image quality in 2D brain anatomical images.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it enables faster MRI scans without sacrificing image quality or diagnostic accuracy, crucial for patients who struggle to remain still or require multiple sequences. By simultaneously correcting common artefacts, it improves the reliability of diagnoses in neurological imaging.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application described is a deep learning model called USArt, designed to recover high-quality MR images from under-sampled data. Its purpose is to achieve up to 5x faster MRI scans while simultaneously correcting for noise and motion artefacts. This directly benefits healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy (by correcting artefacts and improving SNR/contrast), enhancing patient experience (through shorter scan times, especially for children or claustrophobic patients), and potentially increasing patient throughput in clinical settings. It enables the acquisition of more data or more sequences in the same time frame, providing richer diagnostic information.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.</p>
