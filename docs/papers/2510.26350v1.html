                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">UnifiedFL introduces a novel dynamic federated learning framework designed to overcome significant limitations in existing FL approaches, particularly architectural heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and domain-fracture across clients. It achieves this by representing diverse local neural networks as a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN), incorporating distance-driven clustering and a two-tier aggregation policy. Experiments on MedMNIST and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance in fostering equitable federation.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research develops an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework, UnifiedFL, designed to facilitate privacy-preserving collaborative AI model training across multiple healthcare clients. It specifically addresses challenges arising from fundamentally different neural architectures and diverse patient data distributions (statistical and domain heterogeneity) among clients. By enabling robust model training in such heterogeneous environments, UnifiedFL can be applied to develop more generalizable AI models for tasks like medical image classification (e.g., MedMNIST datasets) and segmentation (e.g., hippocampus segmentation for neurological assessment) in areas like radiology and pathology, without requiring the direct sharing of sensitive patient data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL</p>
