                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the zero-shot multilingual capability of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting comorbidity information from Italian Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The study reveals that while LLMs hold promise, their performance in an on-premises zero-shot setting for this specific task is inconsistent, with many struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to traditional pattern matching and manual annotations.</p>

                <p>This research highlights that while LLMs are powerful, their out-of-the-box, zero-shot application in real-world clinical settings, especially for complex information extraction tasks in non-English EHRs, may not yet be sufficiently reliable. This suggests a need for cautious adoption, potential fine-tuning, or hybrid approaches to ensure accuracy in critical areas like comorbidity detection, which directly impacts patient management and treatment decisions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.</p>
