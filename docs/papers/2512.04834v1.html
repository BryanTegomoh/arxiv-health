                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the zero-shot multilingual capability of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from Italian Electronic Health Records (EHRs), specifically focusing on comorbidity extraction. The study reveals that while LLMs show promise, their performance in zero-shot, on-premises settings varies significantly, often struggling to generalize across different diseases and underperforming compared to traditional pattern matching and manual annotations.</p>

                    <p>The study conducted a detailed experimental campaign to assess open-source multilingual LLMs' ability to perform zero-shot comorbidity extraction from Italian Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in an on-premises environment.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Open-source multilingual LLMs demonstrated significant limitations for zero-shot comorbidity extraction from Italian EHRs. Specific findings include that some models struggled outright, others showed high variability in performance, and a general difficulty in generalizing accurately across diverse diseases was observed. Overall, their performance was consistently inferior to both established pattern matching methods and human expert annotations.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings suggest that current zero-shot, multilingual LLM capabilities are not yet robust enough for reliable, real-time comorbidity extraction from Italian EHRs in clinical settings. This implies that direct deployment without further fine-tuning or specialized adaptation could introduce inaccuracies, potentially affecting diagnostic support, treatment planning, patient management, and the overall efficiency and safety of digital healthcare workflows.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study explicitly notes that the LLMs struggled in 'zero-shot, on-premises settings' and exhibited difficulty 'to generalize across various diseases.' This points to a significant limitation in their current ability for broad, unsupervised application in complex multilingual medical contexts.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but the findings strongly imply a need for further research into fine-tuning, specialized training, or more robust architectural designs for LLMs to enhance their generalization capabilities and performance for complex, multilingual medical information extraction tasks, particularly under zero-shot or few-shot learning paradigms.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.</p>
