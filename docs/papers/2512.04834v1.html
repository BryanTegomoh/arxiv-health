                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the zero-shot, multilingual capability of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting information, specifically comorbidities, from Italian Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in an on-premises setting. The study found that while LLMs show potential, many struggled or exhibited significant performance variability and generalization issues, generally underperforming traditional pattern matching and manual annotations for this critical task.</p>

                    <p>Open-source multilingual LLMs exhibited significant struggles in zero-shot, on-premises settings for extracting comorbidities from Italian EHRs. Many showed substantial performance variation and failed to generalize effectively across different diseases, consistently performing worse than both native pattern matching algorithms and expert manual annotations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings suggest that while LLMs hold promise, their current zero-shot application for critical clinical tasks like comorbidity extraction from non-English EHRs may not be sufficiently reliable for direct clinical implementation. Uncritical deployment could lead to inaccurate patient data, compromised diagnostic support, or inefficient clinical workflows, necessitating further research into fine-tuning or more robust multilingual models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.</p>
