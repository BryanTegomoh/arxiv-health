                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application aims to improve disease diagnosis by developing models that can accurately extract and classify diagnostic information from unstructured, free-text clinical narratives (self-reports and discharge notes) and map them to standardized medical codes (ICD-11). This can assist clinicians in diagnosis, enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding, and improve data quality for healthcare management, research, and public health.</p>

                    <p>The study involved creating MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset derived from EHR discharge notes, meticulously aligned with WHO ICD-11. They then developed LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that calculates the length-normalized joint likelihood of a label given the clinical report and subtracts its prior likelihood. This framework was evaluated against a strong GenMap baseline across seven distinct model backbones, with ablation studies performed to dissect the sources of LL-Rank's performance gains.</p>

                <p>This work holds significant clinical potential by enabling more accurate and comprehensive disease diagnosis, leveraging the rich, often subtle, information in clinical narratives that structured EHRs might miss. This could lead to improved patient outcomes through earlier and more precise interventions for both acute and chronic conditions, while also streamlining medical coding, health record management, and epidemiological research through standardized ICD-11 alignment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.</p>
