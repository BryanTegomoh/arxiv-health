                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research develops a mathematical model coupling a two-state q-voter opinion process with SIS-type infection dynamics to investigate the interplay between human behavior and infectious disease spread. It reveals complex system dynamics, including alternative stable states (endemic fixed points or limit cycles) and non-monotonic relationships between infectivity and epidemiological outcomes, emphasizing the profound and often underestimated role of social interventions in epidemic control.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a theoretical framework to understand how public behavior and social dynamics interact with infectious disease spread, highlighting that behavioral and social interventions (often non-pharmaceutical) are equally critical as biomedical controls for effective epidemic management.</p>

                <p>This paper presents a mathematical model of coupled dynamics, not an AI application itself. However, the insights derived from such models could be used to inform the development of AI models for epidemic forecasting, optimizing public health messaging, designing behavioral interventions, or simulating the impact of social dynamics on disease spread.</p>

                    <li>The model features bidirectional coupling: infection transmission rates are influenced by prevailing opinions (behavior), and infection itself can trigger individuals to reassess their behavior.</li>

                    <p>The study employs mathematical modeling, specifically integrating a two-state q-voter opinion process with SIS-type infection dynamics.

                    <p>The coupled model exhibits diverse dynamic behaviors, including stable endemic fixed points and limit cycles, depending on infectivity levels. Beyond a certain infectivity threshold, the system can possess multiple stable states (alternative basins of attraction). Crucially, infectivity shows non-monotonic relationships with both the dominant asymptotic opinion (behavior) and the resulting epidemiological outcomes, demonstrating that adaptive behavior (reassessing upon infection) significantly contributes to complex system dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research suggests that public health strategies must integrate behavioral and social interventions alongside biomedical ones. Understanding how behavioral norms and trust influence disease spread can lead to more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., compliance with vaccination campaigns, mask mandates, social distancing) by predicting complex responses and identifying critical thresholds. This can fundamentally alter long-term epidemic outcomes, making public health policy decisions more robust and adaptive.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This research investigates the coupled dynamics of behavior and infectious disease using a mathematical model. We integrate a two-state q-voter opinion process with SIS-type infection dynamics, where transmission rates are influenced by the opinion and an infection-induced switching mechanism represents individuals reassessing their behav- ior upon infection. Analytically, we derive conditions for the stability of endemic and disease-free equilibria. Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamics: above a certain infectivity threshold, the system can exhibit alternative basins of attraction leading to a balanced endemic fixed point or stable limit cycles. Notably, the dominant asymptotic opinion and resulting epidemiological outcomes show non-monotonic relationships with infectivity, highlighting the potential for adaptive behavior to induce complex system dynamics. These findings underscore the critical role of social interventions; shifts in behavioral norms and trust can permanently alter epidemic outcomes, suggesting that such interventions are as crucial as biomedical controls</p>
