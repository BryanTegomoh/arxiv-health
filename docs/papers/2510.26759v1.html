                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MORE (Multi-Organ Medical Image REconstruction Dataset) to address the critical limitation of current deep learning CT reconstruction methods regarding generalization to diverse anatomies and lesion types. Comprising CT scans across 9 distinct anatomies and 15 lesion types, MORE facilitates robust model training and rigorous evaluation of generalization capabilities. The authors also establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior approaches, demonstrating that comprehensive datasets improve generalization and optimization-based methods enhance robustness for unseen anatomies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies
with 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust
training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)
facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of
models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen
anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our
project page https://more-med.github.io/</p>
