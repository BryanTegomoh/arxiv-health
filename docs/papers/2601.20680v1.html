                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the scalability limitations of batch clustering algorithms like HDBSCAN for real-time social media narrative monitoring by proposing a replacement with online (streaming/incremental) density-based clustering methods. It outlines a three-stage system architecture and a comprehensive evaluation framework, balancing traditional and narrative-specific metrics, to assess online algorithms across critical dimensions like cluster quality, efficiency, and memory footprint using sliding-window simulations. The research aims to bridge the gap between static topic modeling and the dynamic nature of social media data, with broad implications for real-time information analysis.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI system uses online density-based clustering to process continuous social media data streams for real-time monitoring of evolving narratives. In a health context, this AI could be deployed for public health surveillance to detect early signals of disease outbreaks, track the spread and evolution of health-related misinformation (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, unproven treatments), monitor public sentiment regarding health policies or interventions, and support rapid response in public health emergencies. For biosecurity, it could serve as an intelligence tool to identify unusual health-related discussions, potential threats, or disinformation campaigns that might indicate biological hazards or undermine biosecurity measures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.</p>
