                <p class="summary-text">This research paper developed and evaluated machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to predict all-cause hospital readmissions using high-dimensional medical claims data. Principal Component Analysis was employed for dimension reduction, and models were compared using the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. The Random Forest model achieved the highest predictive performance, offering a valuable tool for identifying at-risk patients and improving healthcare quality while reducing costs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.</p>
