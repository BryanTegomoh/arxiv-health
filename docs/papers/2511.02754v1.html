                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DANIEL, a distributed and scalable framework that leverages a revisited Ising model to perform privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale, high-dimensional binary medical data. It addresses challenges of data heterogeneity and sharing constraints in modern healthcare by optimizing a non-convex surrogate loss function via bi-factored gradient descent. Evaluated on multi-institutional EHR data from 58,248 patients, DANIEL demonstrates superior performance in global representation learning and critical downstream clinical tasks like patient phenotyping and clustering.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in
modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality,
source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we
revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field
(MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and
privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with
inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss
function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational
and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate
our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets
from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global
representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship
detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight
a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional
settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and
multi-institutional integration.</p>
