                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces DANIEL, a distributed and scalable framework based on the Ising model, designed for global representation learning from large-scale, low-rank binary data, particularly Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It addresses challenges of high-dimensionality, source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints prevalent in modern healthcare data by optimizing a non-convex surrogate loss function via bi-factored gradient descent. The framework demonstrates superior performance in global representation learning and downstream clinical tasks across multi-institutional EHR datasets.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This work provides a critical solution for extracting valuable, actionable insights from vast, often siloed, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data across multiple healthcare institutions while strictly adhering to patient privacy and data-sharing regulations. It enables more accurate and comprehensive patient characterization, predictive modeling, and identification of clinical relationships, which are vital for personalized medicine and population health management.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This paper applies AI/ML techniques (representation learning, graphical models) to develop a scalable and privacy-preserving method for analyzing real-world, multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) data. This enables AI applications such as automated patient phenotyping (identifying patient subgroups with similar characteristics), patient clustering, and detecting relationships between clinical entities (diseases, symptoms, treatments), which can aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in a federated learning setting.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The DANIEL framework revisits the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field family, and develops a distributed approach. It is designed for scalable and privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale, low-rank binary data. The core technical contribution lies in optimizing a non-convex surrogate loss function using bi-factored gradient descent, which offers substantial computational and communication efficiency advantages over traditional convex optimization methods. This distributed architecture facilitates learning across federated data sources without direct data sharing.</p>

                    <p>The DANIEL algorithm achieved superior performance in global representation learning when applied to multi-institutional EHR datasets. Crucially, it demonstrated enhanced capabilities in several downstream clinical tasks: improving relationship detection within the data, enabling more accurate patient phenotyping (characterizing distinct patient groups), and facilitating effective patient clustering. These results underscore its practical utility in complex, real-world healthcare settings.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability of DANIEL to perform robust global representation learning across diverse EHR datasets can profoundly improve the understanding of complex disease patterns and patient cohorts. More precise patient phenotyping can lead to tailored diagnostic approaches, refined risk stratification, and highly personalized treatment plans. Enhanced patient clustering can identify optimal cohorts for clinical trials or targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes, advancing precision medicine, and boosting healthcare efficiency, especially in collaborative, multi-institutional environments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in
modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality,
source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we
revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field
(MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and
privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with
inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss
function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational
and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate
our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets
from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global
representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship
detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight
a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional
settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and
multi-institutional integration.</p>
