                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces HalluGuard, a novel theoretical framework and practical method to address critical LLM hallucinations stemming from both data-driven and reasoning-driven sources. It formalizes hallucination risk using the Hallucination Risk Bound and proposes an NTK-based score to jointly detect these issues. HalluGuard consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, significantly enhancing LLM reliability.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves a two-pronged approach: (1) A theoretical framework, the Hallucination Risk Bound, which formally decomposes hallucination risk into components attributed to training-time data mismatches and inference-time instabilities. (2) A practical detection score, HalluGuard, which is NTK-based and utilizes the induced geometry and captured representations of the Neural Tangent Kernel to jointly identify both data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. This method was empirically validated through extensive experimentation on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific discovery is often compromised by hallucinations. These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations.</p>
