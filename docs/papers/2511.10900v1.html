                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the limitation of large language models (LLMs) in medical question answering, which often overlook domain-specific expertise like clinical subject areas and certification levels. The authors introduce EMSQA, a new medical dataset, and propose Expert-CoT prompting and ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, both designed to leverage this structured context. Their methods significantly improve accuracy and enable a 32B expertise-augmented LLM to pass simulated EMS certification exams.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved creating EMSQA, a 24.3K multiple-choice dataset covering 10 clinical subject areas and 4 EMS certification levels, along with curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases. Two methods were developed: (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy for chain-of-thought reasoning conditioned on specific clinical subject areas and certification levels, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses using subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. These methods were evaluated on 4 different large language models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.</p>
