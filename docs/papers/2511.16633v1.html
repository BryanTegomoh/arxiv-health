                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes an advanced computational method (Hessian-free ray-Born inversion) for image reconstruction in quantitative ultrasound tomography. While this involves complex optimization and computational techniques, it is not explicitly presented as an AI (machine learning/deep learning) application in the traditional sense, but rather a sophisticated inverse problem solver for generating quantitative medical images. Such quantitative imaging data, however, could serve as crucial input for subsequent AI-driven diagnostic or analytical systems in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study presents the first experimental validation of a Hessian-free ray-Born inversion technique for quantitative reconstruction of sound speed from transmission ultrasound data. The method combines single-scattering theory with high-frequency approximations, yielding an inversion framework well suited to the frequency ranges used in clinical ultrasound applications. Unlike previous singly-scattered inversion approaches that account for medium heterogeneities only in the scattering potential, the proposed ray-Born method employs Green's functions approximated along ray trajectories determined by high-frequency assumptions. The associated objective function is linearized and minimized sequentially across increasing frequency bands. At each frequency set, the linearized subproblem is solved using a weighting scheme applied to both the solution and data spaces, which diagonalizes the Hessian and enables its inversion in a single step. The method, previously reported and released as an open-source package, was applied to in-vitro and in-vivo datasets provided by the University of Rochester Medical Center. The reconstructed images were evaluated by comparison with those obtained using a full-wave inversion approach based on a frequency-domain Helmholtz solver. The results demonstrate the strong potential of the Hessian-free ray-Born inversion as a computationally efficient and accurate method suitable for clinical translation.</p>
