                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a counter-intuitive hypothesis: while antibiotic therapy cures individuals, it might, under specific conditions, increase the overall duration of infectiousness and consequently boost between-host disease transmission. This occurs because antibiotics' suppression of within-host pathogen density can reduce the probability of a host being removed from infectious status by non-treatment means (e.g., isolation due to severe symptoms or mortality), especially when these removal events are pathogen-density dependent.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research highlights a crucial, often overlooked, epidemiological consequence of antibiotic use beyond individual patient cure. It suggests that treatment strategies must consider not only within-host pathogen clearance but also the potential broader public health impact on disease transmission dynamics, especially in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance and sub-optimal drug regimens.</p>

This within-host model drives the time-dependent probability of disease transmission and the probabilistic duration of the infectious period.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is the identification of conditions under which antibiotic treatment can paradoxically increase the duration of a host's infectiousness, thereby increasing the expected number of new infections. This effect is particularly pronounced when antibiotic efficacy is lower, suggesting that such treatments might transform rare, severe bacterial diseases into more common, albeit treatable, infections.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research mandates a re-evaluation of antibiotic treatment guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship programs. Clinicians and public health authorities may need to consider not just clearing infection but also optimizing treatment duration and efficacy to prevent inadvertently prolonging infectiousness. It suggests that treatments leading to partial pathogen suppression, rather than complete eradication, could have detrimental community-level transmission consequences, influencing decisions on antibiotic choice, dosing, and duration.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Humans, domestic animals, orchard crops, and ornamental plants are commonly treated with antibiotics in response to bacterial infection. By curing infectious individuals, antibiotic therapy might limit the spread of contagious disease among hosts. But an antibiotic`s suppression of within-host pathogen density might also reduce the probability that the host is otherwise removed from infectious status prior to therapeutic recovery. When rates of both recovery via treatment and other removal events (e.g., isolation or mortality) depend directly on within-host pathogen density, antibiotic treatment can relax the overall removal rate sufficiently to increase between-host disease transmission. To explore this dependence, a deterministic within-host dynamics drives the infectious host's time-dependent probability of disease transmission, as well as the probabilistic duration of the infectious period. At the within-host scale, the model varies (1) inoculum size, (2) bacterial self-regulation, (3) the time between infection and initiation of therapy, and (4) antibiotic efficacy. At the between-host scale the model varies (5) the size/susceptibility of groups randomly encountered by an infectious host. Results identify conditions where antibiotic treatment can increase duration of a host`s infectiousness, and consequently increase the expected number of new infections. At lower antibiotic efficacy, treatment might convert a rare, serious bacterial disease into a common, but treatable infection.</p>
