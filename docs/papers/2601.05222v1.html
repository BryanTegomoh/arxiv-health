                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to investigate how spontaneous household decision-making regarding breeding site control influences mosquito population dynamics. It reveals that the feedback loop between perceived risks, household control actions, and mosquito abundance can lead to sustained oscillations in mosquito populations, independent of environmental factors. The study characterizes conditions under which these human-behaviorally driven oscillations emerge.</p>

With prevalence-dependent perceived risk, a fifth equilibrium with partial household engagement emerges.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work suggests that public health interventions for mosquito-borne diseases must account for the dynamic interplay between vector populations and human behavioral feedback. Interventions that do not sustain consistent household engagement might inadvertently trigger or perpetuate oscillatory mosquito populations due to fluctuating risk perception and adherence. This necessitates adaptive and continuous strategies, potentially involving dynamic risk communication and community engagement models, to maintain effective breeding site control and prevent cycles of disease resurgence.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major public-health threat, and the effective control of mosquito populations requires sustained household participation in removing breeding sites. While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes.</p>
