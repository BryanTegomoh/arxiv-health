                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to analyze how spontaneous household decisions regarding breeding site control influence mosquito population dynamics. It reveals a feedback loop where perceived risks drive household control actions, which in turn regulate the mosquito carrying capacity. A key finding is that when perceived risk depends on mosquito prevalence, the system can exhibit sustained oscillations in both mosquito abundance and household engagement, arising intrinsically from their dynamic interaction via a Hopf bifurcation.</p>

                    <p>The authors employ a game-theoretic modeling approach that incorporates imitation dynamics to simulate household behavior based on perceived risks. This behavioral component is explicitly linked to mosquito population dynamics by modulating the carrying capacity of the aquatic stage.

Numerical simulations and parameter explorations are performed to further detail the properties of these oscillations.</p>

                    <p>The model identifies four stable equilibria in a simplified scenario, representing various states of control and mosquito presence. More importantly, when perceived risk is dynamically tied to mosquito prevalence, an additional equilibrium emerges with partial household engagement. Crucially, conditions are derived under which this partial engagement equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, leading to sustained, endogenous oscillations in both mosquito abundance and household control levels, driven solely by the internal feedback between human behavior and vector populations. Numerical analysis further characterizes the amplitude and phase of these oscillations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This theoretical insight has significant practical implications for public health. It suggests that mosquito control programs must anticipate and adapt to inherent fluctuations in community engagement, which can arise from the dynamics of perceived risk. Understanding these endogenous oscillatory regimes can help public health officials design adaptive interventions, optimize resource allocation, and potentially break cycles of disease transmission by fostering more stable and sustained household control efforts rather than assuming constant compliance. It underscores the necessity of integrating behavioral science into vector control strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major public-health threat, and the effective control of mosquito populations requires sustained household participation in removing breeding sites. While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes.</p>
