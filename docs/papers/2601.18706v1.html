                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Health-SCORE functions as a rubric-based framework for training and evaluation. It is applied in two primary ways: firstly, as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning (RL) with built-in safety-aware supervision. Secondly, it is directly incorporated into LLM prompts to facilitate in-context learning (ICL), aiming to improve the quality of generated responses. The core innovation lies in its ability to generate or apply rubrics scalably while maintaining quality on par with human-expert developed rubrics.</p>

                    <p>The primary findings are that Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality equivalent to rubrics created by human experts. It significantly lowers the development effort and associated costs for creating such rubrics. Consequently, the framework makes rubric-based evaluation and training for LLMs, especially in open-ended healthcare tasks, much more scalable.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Rubrics are essential for evaluating open-ended LLM responses, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. However, creating high-quality and domain-specific rubrics typically requires significant human expertise time and development cost, making rubric-based evaluation and training difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.</p>
