                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel task-adaptive deep learning framework for low-dose CT reconstruction, addressing the prevalent issue where existing methods achieve high standard image quality metrics but fail to preserve critical diagnostic anatomical details. By incorporating a frozen pre-trained task network as a regularization term in the reconstruction loss, the proposed method effectively guides the reconstruction process to maintain diagnostic quality relevant to specific clinical tasks. This approach significantly outperforms traditional and joint-training methods, approaching full-dose performance on segmentation tasks.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on a deep learning-based low-dose CT reconstruction framework. The core innovation is the modification of the reconstruction loss function to incorporate a regularization term. This regularization term is derived from the output of a *frozen* (non-trainable during reconstruction training) pre-trained task-specific neural network (e.g., a segmentation network). This allows the reconstruction process to be guided by the requirements of a specific diagnostic task, ensuring that task-relevant features are preserved, rather than relying solely on general image quality metrics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography reconstruction methods
already achieve high performance on standard image quality metrics like peak
signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure. Yet, they
frequently fail to preserve the critical anatomical details needed for
diagnostic tasks. This fundamental limitation hinders their clinical
applicability despite their high metric scores. We propose a novel
task-adaptive reconstruction framework that addresses this gap by incorporating
a frozen pre-trained task network as a regularization term in the
reconstruction loss function. Unlike existing joint-training approaches that
simultaneously optimize both reconstruction and task networks, and risk
diverging from satisfactory reconstructions, our method leverages a pre-trained
task model to guide reconstruction training while still maintaining diagnostic
quality. We validate our framework on a liver and liver tumor segmentation
task. Our task-adaptive models achieve Dice scores up to 0.707, approaching the
performance of full-dose scans (0.874), and substantially outperforming
joint-training approaches (0.331) and traditional reconstruction methods
(0.626). Critically, our framework can be integrated into any existing deep
learning-based reconstruction model through simple loss function modification,
enabling widespread adoption for task-adaptive optimization in clinical
practice. Our codes are available at:
