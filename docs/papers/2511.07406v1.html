                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Simulating trajectories of multi-particle systems on complex energy
landscapes is a central task in molecular dynamics (MD) and drug discovery, but
remains challenging at scale due to computationally expensive and long
simulations. Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or
Schr\"odinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through
data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and
heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over
their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this
gap, we introduce Entangled Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a
framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of
interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each
particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We
define the Entangled Schr\"odinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a
coupled system of bias forces that entangle particle velocities. We show that
our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under
perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.</p>
