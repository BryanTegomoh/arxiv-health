                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a data-physics hybrid generative model designed to reconstruct patient-specific neuromuscular control from a single level-ground walking trial, enabling dynamic prediction of task-conditioned locomotion for stroke survivors. By integrating wearable sensor data with a physics controller and deep reinforcement learning, the framework generates physically plausible gait simulations for challenging scenarios like slopes and stairs. In a pilot study, clinicians using these predictions to guide rehabilitation achieved significantly larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores compared to control clinicians.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a data-physics hybrid generative framework. It takes input from a single 20m level-ground walking trial captured by wearable sensors. This data is used to inform a system comprising a proportional-derivative (PD) physics controller, a population-based Healthy Motion Atlas, and a goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The DRL agent is trained using behavior cloning (BC) and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to reconstruct patient-specific neuromuscular control and generate physically plausible, task-conditioned gait simulations for scenarios like slopes and stairs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dynamic prediction of locomotor capacity after stroke is crucial for tailoring rehabilitation, yet current assessments provide only static impairment scores and do not indicate whether patients can safely perform specific tasks such as slope walking or stair climbing. Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies.</p>
