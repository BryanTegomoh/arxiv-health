                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces GRASP, a novel method addressing mode collapse in text-to-image diffusion models when generating images for rare medical pathologies, a prevalent issue in long-tail datasets. GRASP mitigates gradient conflicts between frequent and rare classes by partitioning samples into clusters and injecting cluster-specific residual adapters, leading to significantly improved generation quality and diversity for rare conditions and enhanced downstream classification performance.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>GRASP operates by first using external priors to statically partition medical imaging samples into distinct clusters, carefully designed to minimize gradient conflicts within each cluster. Subsequently, it fine-tunes pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into the transformer feedforward layers. This injection method bypasses learned gating mechanisms, which contributes to the stability and efficiency of adapting the model to generate high-quality images across the entire long-tail distribution.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable high-fidelity generation across diverse prompts. However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.</p>
