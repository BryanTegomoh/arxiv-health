                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>GeMM-GAN operates as a conditional Generative Adversarial Network. It processes histopathology tissue slides by first extracting image patches, which are then encoded using a Transformer Encoder. Clinical descriptions are tokenized to represent textual information. A critical component is the Cross Attention mechanism, which enables the integration of features from both the image patches and the text tokens, producing a unified 'conditioning vector.' This multimodal conditioning vector subsequently guides the generative model (the generator component of the GAN) to synthesize realistic and biologically coherent gene expression profiles. The entire framework is trained and validated on the TCGA dataset.</p>

The framework significantly outperforms standard generative models in the quality and functional meaningfulness of the generated data. Crucially, the synthetic gene expression profiles generated by GeMM-GAN lead to an improvement of over 11% in accuracy for downstream disease type prediction tasks when compared to state-of-the-art generative models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.
