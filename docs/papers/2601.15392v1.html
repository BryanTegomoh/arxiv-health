                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>GeMM-GAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. It integrates multimodal data by first employing a Transformer Encoder to process patches from histopathology images. This visual information is then combined with text tokens from clinical descriptions using a Cross Attention mechanism. The output of this multimodal integration is a compact conditioning vector, which subsequently guides the generative model to synthesize realistic and biologically coherent gene expression profiles.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.
