                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper offers the first theoretical explanation, using information theory, for why state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods catastrophically fail on models trained with single-domain datasets. It proves that such training leads to "domain feature collapse," where models discard all domain-specific information (I(x_d; z) = 0). The authors introduce "Domain Bench" and demonstrate that preserving domain information through a method called "domain filtering" successfully resolves this failure mode, providing strong empirical evidence for their theory.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is critically important for medical AI, as diagnostic models are frequently trained on single-domain medical image datasets (e.g., specific hospital scans or particular disease cohorts). Understanding and mitigating "domain feature collapse" is essential for developing robust and trustworthy medical AI that can reliably detect out-of-domain samples or generalize to new clinical environments without catastrophic performance degradation.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research can lead to more robust and safer AI models for medical image analysis, diagnosis, and screening. By improving out-of-distribution detection, medical AI systems can reliably flag cases where they encounter data outside their training distribution, preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatment recommendations. This enhances the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI tools in healthcare.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that supervised learning on single-domain data inherently leads to "domain feature collapse," where domain-specific information is completely discarded (I(x_d; z) = 0). This collapse is identified as the fundamental reason for catastrophic OOD detection failures. The research also found that actively preserving some domain-specific information (I(x_d; z) > 0) through techniques like "domain filtering" effectively resolves this critical failure mode.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has significant clinical impact by addressing a major barrier to the safe and reliable deployment of AI in healthcare. It provides a theoretical basis and a practical direction for mitigating the risks associated with domain shift in medical AI. By enabling more robust OOD detection, clinicians can have greater confidence that an AI model will flag unfamiliar or out-of-domain medical data, preventing misdiagnosis or catastrophic errors when models encounter data from different scanners, hospitals, or patient populations than their training set. This understanding will inform better development and deployment strategies for transfer learning in clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated as limitations of their own work, the abstract implies certain practical considerations: the proposed solution of "domain filtering" relies on the availability and quality of effective pretrained representations. Its "conceptual straightforwardness" might mask complexity in practical implementation, especially in defining and preserving truly relevant domain-specific information for diverse and complex medical datasets. The focus on single-domain training also leaves room for further exploration in multi-domain learning scenarios.</p>

                <p>The paper suggests future research in broader implications for transfer learning, specifically guiding decisions on when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models. This implies exploring optimal strategies for integrating pretrained models into medical AI pipelines to prevent domain feature collapse while adapting to new data, and potentially developing more advanced domain filtering or preservation techniques.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.</p>
