                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper offers the first theoretical explanation for the catastrophic failure of state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods when models are trained on single-domain datasets. It proves that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably leads to "domain feature collapse," where domain-specific information is completely discarded, resolving this failure mode by preserving domain information through a novel domain filtering technique using pretrained representations.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is critically relevant to medical AI, as models are often trained on single-domain datasets (e.g., images from one hospital or scanner). Domain feature collapse explains why such models catastrophically fail when deployed in new clinical environments with different data distributions, directly impacting their safety and efficacy for patient care.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research aims to improve the safety and reliability of AI systems used in medical diagnostics and healthcare by explaining and offering solutions to a fundamental limitation in detecting out-of-distribution samples. This capability is essential for AI models to correctly identify when they are presented with data outside their training experience (e.g., a medical image from a different scanner, a rare disease not seen during training, or a non-medical artifact), preventing misdiagnosis or confident errors and thus enabling more trustworthy deployment in clinical settings.</p>

                    <li>The analysis is extended using Fano's inequality to quantify partial domain feature collapse in practical scenarios, acknowledging that complete collapse might be an idealization.</li>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has profound clinical impact by identifying a core reason for the lack of generalizability and robustness in medical AI, particularly for diagnostic systems. Understanding domain feature collapse allows for the development of more reliable AI models that can perform consistently across diverse hospital settings, scanner types, and patient demographics. Implementing strategies like domain filtering could significantly improve the trustworthiness and deployability of AI in healthcare, preventing misdiagnoses or failures when models encounter unseen clinical data distributions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.</p>
