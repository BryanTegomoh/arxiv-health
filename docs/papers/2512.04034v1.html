                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper provides an information-theoretic explanation for the catastrophic failure of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods when models are trained on single-domain datasets, attributing it to "domain feature collapse" where domain-specific information is completely discarded (I(x_d; z) = 0). The authors introduce a solution, domain filtering using pretrained representations to preserve domain information, which empirically resolves this failure mode and offers insights into supervised learning limitations and transfer learning strategies.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as AI models, particularly in medical imaging, are frequently trained on single-domain datasets from specific institutions or scanners. Understanding and mitigating domain feature collapse is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of AI deployments in diverse clinical settings, where encountering out-of-domain patient data is common.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research directly informs the development of more robust and reliable AI systems for health and medicine. By explaining why AI models fail catastrophically on out-of-domain medical inputs and proposing solutions, it helps build AI that can better identify when it's operating outside its comfort zone (e.g., encountering an unusual medical image), thereby preventing misdiagnoses or inappropriate interventions. This is crucial for applications like medical image analysis (radiology, pathology), predictive analytics, and any AI system deployed in diverse clinical environments where data distributions can shift unexpectedly.</p>

                    <p>The central finding is the theoretical proof of "domain feature collapse" in models trained on single-domain data, where domain-specific information (I(x_d; z)) is completely discarded. This fundamental limitation leads to catastrophic failure in OOD detection. The research also found that actively preserving domain information through a method like domain filtering (utilizing pretrained representations) effectively resolves this OOD detection failure, providing strong empirical validation for the theoretical framework.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work directly impacts the development and deployment of AI in clinical settings by explaining a critical failure mode of OOD detection. It suggests that AI models trained solely on institution-specific medical data may generalize poorly to data from different hospitals, scanners, or patient populations. The proposed solution (domain filtering) offers a pathway to build more robust and reliable medical AI systems, enabling safer and more accurate diagnoses and prognoses across varied clinical environments. It also provides principled guidance for adapting existing pretrained models for clinical use, a common practice in medical AI.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While the abstract highlights the solution's conceptual straightforwardness, an implicit limitation is the reliance on pretrained representations for domain filtering, which may not always be available or optimally suited for highly specialized medical tasks. The focus on single-domain training also suggests that the full complexity of multi-domain or federated learning scenarios is not fully addressed, though the theory provides foundational insights.</p>

Future work could explore how to optimally fine-tune or freeze pretrained models to prevent domain feature collapse while adapting to new medical tasks. Investigating methods for inherent domain information preservation during single-domain training, beyond filtering, is another potential direction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.</p>
