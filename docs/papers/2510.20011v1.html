                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.</p>
