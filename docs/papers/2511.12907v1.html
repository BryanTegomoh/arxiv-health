                    <p>The researchers developed an ultra-flexible and strong thin-film ECoG array (256 electrodes/4 cm²) engineered for guidewire-driven deployment. The device is designed to be folded, threaded through millimetre-sized skull holes, and then unfurled onto the dura mater in an epidural configuration. Its efficacy was tested by implanting it in canine brains, recording auditory neural signals, and subsequently applying standard machine learning models to classify different sound types based on the acquired neural data. Biocompatibility for chronic use was also reported.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Electrocorticographic brain computer interfaces are powerful emergent technologies for advancing basic neuroscience research and targeted clinical interventions. However, existing devices require trade-offs between coverage area, electrode density, surgical invasiveness and complication risk: limitations that fail to meet the demands of next-generation BCI. Here, we report a guidewire-driven deployable ECoG BCI device that can be epidurally implanted using minimally invasive procedures. Our ultra-flexible but strong thin-film electrode array, which packs 256 electrodes into 4 cm2, can be folded, pulled through millimetre-sized skull holes, and unfurled seamlessly onto the brain dura mater. When deployed on the canine brain, it captures abundant high-quality auditory neural signals with distinct features of hearing that can be used to classify sound types with over 80% accuracy using various standard machine learning models. Our device is biocompatible for chronic monitoring, easy and fast to deploy and importantly, resolves the key trade-offs limiting current BCI technologies.</p>
