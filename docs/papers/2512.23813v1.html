                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">StressRoBERTa is a novel cross-condition transfer learning approach for the automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. By continually training a RoBERTa model on data from conditions highly comorbid with stress (depression, anxiety, PTSD), it achieved an 82% F1-score, outperforming the best prior system by 3 percentage points and demonstrating superior performance compared to general mental health models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Chronic stress is a significant public health concern with widespread implications for mental and physical health. This research provides a sophisticated tool for early and passive detection of self-reported chronic stress from social media, which can inform public health surveillance, facilitate timely interventions, and support mental health resource allocation.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the development of StressRoBERTa, a natural language processing model, for the automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress from social media text. It employs cross-condition transfer learning from clinically related mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD) to improve stress detection, which could be used for early identification, monitoring, or population-level mental health surveillance.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized a cross-condition transfer learning paradigm. A RoBERTa language model was continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus, a large dataset (108M words) derived from Twitter users self-reporting diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. This continually trained model, named StressRoBERTa, was then fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset for chronic stress detection. Its performance was evaluated using the F1-score metric on both the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 and the external Dreaddit dataset.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This technology offers a promising avenue for public health surveillance by enabling the passive identification of individuals or populations experiencing chronic stress via social media. Clinicians and public health practitioners could leverage such models to identify at-risk individuals who might benefit from early intervention, improve epidemiological tracking of stress prevalence, and inform resource allocation for mental health services, potentially mitigating the impact of chronic stress and its comorbid conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.</p>
