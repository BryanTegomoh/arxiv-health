                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The enhanced predictive accuracy of PETRA, particularly for spike protein mutations, has significant clinical and public health implications. It enables earlier anticipation of new, potentially more transmissible or immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, allowing for more proactive and targeted vaccine redesign, therapeutic development, and the implementation of public health measures. This capability can improve pandemic preparedness, optimize surveillance programs, and guide resource allocation for diagnostics and treatments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra</p>
