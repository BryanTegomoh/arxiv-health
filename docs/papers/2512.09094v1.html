                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper extends causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional medical image segmentation, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to deep learning model performance degradation under distribution shifts. By modeling the data-generating process with a causal graph and employing Shapley values, the authors reveal that annotation shifts are the dominant cause of performance drops when models cross annotators, while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers. This mechanism-specific quantification allows for targeted intervention strategies to improve model robustness.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves extending existing causal attribution frameworks to handle high-dimensional segmentation outputs. It models the data-generating process using a causal graph to represent dependencies between acquisition protocols, annotation variability, and model performance. Shapley values are then applied to quantitatively attribute performance changes (e.g., Dice Similarity Coefficient - DSC) to these individual causal mechanisms, addressing challenges like limited samples and complex interactions. The framework was validated using MS lesion segmentation data from multiple imaging centers and annotators.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The paper's key findings reveal that the causal mechanisms behind deep learning model performance drops in medical imaging under distribution shifts are context-dependent. Specifically, when a model's performance degrades due to encountering different annotators, annotation protocol shifts are the primary cause, accounting for a mean DSC attribution of 7.4% ± 8.9%. Conversely, when performance drops are observed across different imaging centers, shifts in acquisition protocols are the dominant factor, with a mean DSC attribution of 6.5% ± 9.1%. This indicates that the largest performance gaps are driven by distinct factors depending on the type of shift encountered.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact is significant as it provides a data-driven approach for identifying and addressing the root causes of AI model failures in medical imaging. Clinicians and developers can use this mechanism-specific quantification to prioritize interventions, such as investing in better annotation standardization training when annotator variability is the main issue, or focusing on image harmonization techniques when acquisition shifts dominate. This leads to more efficient resource allocation and the development of more robust, generalizable, and clinically reliable AI systems for tasks like disease segmentation and diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models for medical image segmentation suffer significant performance drops due to distribution shifts, but the causal mechanisms behind these drops remain poorly understood. We extend causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional segmentation tasks, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to performance degradation. We model the data-generating process through a causal graph and employ Shapley values to fairly attribute performance changes to individual mechanisms. Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\pm$ 9.1%). This mechanism-specific quantification enables practitioners to prioritize targeted interventions based on deployment context.</p>
