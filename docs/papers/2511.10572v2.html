                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework designed for individualized resource allocation in high-stakes domains like healthcare, specifically addressing challenges posed by delayed feedback, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. The framework optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations while identifying the most responsive individuals within those groups, accounting for temporal dynamics and treatment delays. Validated on real-world datasets, the approach demonstrates superior cumulative outcomes, better adaptation to delay structures, and equitable resource distribution.</p>

                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and health because it provides a data-driven framework for optimizing the allocation of limited healthcare resources, such as specialized treatments, preventive programs, or medical devices, especially when patient outcomes are delayed, and individual responses vary significantly.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research describes a bi-level contextual bandit framework using neural networks to optimize the allocation of limited resources in healthcare. This AI application could be used to: 1) Allocate specific medical treatments or interventions to individual patients or patient subgroups based on their predicted responsiveness and delayed outcomes. 2) Distribute limited healthcare resources (e.g., vaccines, medical devices, specialist appointments) equitably, while considering fairness, operational constraints, and individual patient characteristics. 3) Inform health policy decisions by predicting the short-term utility and long-term impact of resource allocation strategies within dynamic healthcare systems.</p>

                    <p>The paper proposes a bi-level contextual bandit framework. At the meta-level, it optimizes budget allocations for different subgroups to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base-level, it employs a neural network, trained on observational data, to identify the most responsive individuals for resource allocation within each subgroup. This base-level decision-making explicitly incorporates resource-specific delay kernels to model delayed treatment effects and respects cooldown windows, thereby accounting for temporal dynamics and feedback delays.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has the potential to significantly improve clinical decision-making and resource allocation in healthcare. It can lead to more effective and equitable distribution of medical interventions, treatments, or preventive care, especially for conditions with long-term or delayed outcomes (e.g., chronic disease management, rehabilitation). By identifying the most responsive patients and ensuring fair access, it can enhance overall patient welfare, optimize the utilization of scarce medical resources, and inform better institutional policies in healthcare systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.</p>
