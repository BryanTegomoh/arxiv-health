                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper audits the fairness of automated tumor segmentation within the MAMA-MIA breast cancer dataset, uncovering significant age-related bias against younger patients that persists even after accounting for data source. It also reveals how aggregating data influences site-specific ethnic biases, emphasizing the critical need for granular data analysis in fairness evaluations. The findings highlight potential disparities in diagnostic quality for specific demographic groups if such biases remain unaddressed.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.</p>
