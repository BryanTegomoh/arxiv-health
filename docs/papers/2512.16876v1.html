                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel application of Federated Learning (FL) to address the challenge of data scarcity and privacy in diagnosing rare diseases, specifically Collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD). By enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets from two international organizations using immunofluorescence microscopy images, the study developed an ML model that achieved an F1-score of 0.82 for classifying COL6-RD pathogenic mechanisms, significantly outperforming single-institution models.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant as it offers a practical and privacy-preserving solution to leverage fragmented data for rare disease diagnosis, which is typically hindered by limited patient cohorts. It paves the way for more accurate and widely applicable diagnostic tools, improving patient care for complex and often misdiagnosed conditions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is Federated Learning (FL) used to develop a more accurate and generalizable machine learning model for the diagnosis and subtyping of Collagen VI-Related Dystrophies (COL6-RD). FL enables collaborative model training across decentralized, private datasets from multiple institutions, overcoming data scarcity and privacy barriers inherent in medical research. This model classifies patient immunofluorescence microscopy images into specific pathogenic mechanism groups (exon skipping, glycine substitution, pseudoexon insertion), thereby improving diagnostic utility and supporting clinical genetic interpretation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.</p>
