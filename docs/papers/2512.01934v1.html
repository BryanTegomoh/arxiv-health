                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) systems that operates by generating adversarial trajectories without directly attacking the object detection module. AdvTraj successfully transfers the attacker's ID to a target object, demonstrating 100% success in white-box simulations and high transferability to state-of-the-art MOT algorithms, revealing critical vulnerabilities in their object association mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is an AI application used in health for real-time monitoring of patients (e.g., for fall detection, tracking wandering, adherence to social distancing in clinical environments), enhancing hospital security (e.g., tracking staff and visitors in sensitive areas, monitoring valuable medical equipment), and ensuring biosecurity by tracking personnel movement within research labs or infectious disease units. This research reveals a critical vulnerability in these AI systems that, if exploited, could compromise patient safety, data privacy, hospital security, and biosecurity protocols by allowing for physical manipulation and misidentification within the tracking system.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>In a clinical context, the vulnerability demonstrated by AdvTraj means that autonomous systems like robotic surgical assistants or automated drug delivery robots, relying on MOT for object identification and tracking, could be tricked into misidentifying critical objects (e.g., surgical tools, patients, or medications). This could lead to serious clinical errors, patient safety incidents, or compromised operational integrity within healthcare facilities. Ensuring the robustness of MOT systems against such adversarial attacks is crucial for safe and reliable medical automation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.</p>
