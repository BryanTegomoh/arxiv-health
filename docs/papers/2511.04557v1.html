                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research introduces a novel graph transformer architecture (Relational Graph Perceiver - RGP) that integrates structural and temporal context for relational deep learning with multi-task prediction capabilities. In healthcare, RGP can be applied to analyze complex, interconnected data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), patient-provider networks, and medical ontologies. This enables applications like predicting disease progression, identifying high-risk patients, recommending personalized treatments based on a patient's historical data and network interactions, forecasting resource needs in hospitals, and understanding complex patient journeys over time by modeling the temporal dynamics of interactions between patients, providers, diagnoses, and treatments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.</p>
