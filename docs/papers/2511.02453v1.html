                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the issue of statistically unreliable performance claims in machine learning models, particularly in medical imaging, by introducing the concept of "underspecification." It extends a statistical framework to incorporate underspecification (variability due to random initialization or training dynamics) as an additional variance component. The findings demonstrate that even modest seed variability substantially increases the evidence required to statistically claim model superiority, underscoring the necessity of explicitly modeling training variance in medical imaging system validation.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved extending a pre-existing statistical framework designed to model false outperformance claims. The key methodological step was to incorporate 'underspecification' as an additional component of variance within this framework. Subsequently, simulations were conducted to quantify the impact of this added variance, specifically seed variability, on the statistical evidence required to substantiate claims of model superiority.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The main finding is that even a small amount of seed variability (around 1%) significantly increases the statistical evidence required to confidently claim that one machine learning model is superior to another. This implies that current validation practices, if they don't account for such variance, might be prone to reporting non-robust performance gains.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work will prompt more rigorous statistical validation of AI models before their deployment in clinical settings, potentially preventing the adoption of systems whose perceived performance advantages are not statistically robust. This translates to more reliable diagnostic tools, improved patient safety, and better-informed clinical decisions, by ensuring that only genuinely superior systems are integrated into healthcare workflows.</p>

As the findings are based on simulations, they might not fully capture all complexities of real-world medical imaging data and diverse model architectures.</p>

                <p>The paper strongly advocates for a future shift in standard practice: the explicit and routine modeling of training variance (including underspecification) during the validation of all machine learning systems, particularly those intended for medical imaging applications. This suggests a need for new benchmarks and methodologies that incorporate these principles.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.</p>
