                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigates the previously under-explored relationship between enforcing fairness constraints and the resulting changes in model explanations within machine learning models, particularly in healthcare contexts. The authors found that improving fairness through bias mitigation techniques significantly alters Shapley-based feature importance rankings, sometimes with differential impacts across different racial subgroups. This highlights the critical need for a holistic assessment of ML models, considering accuracy, fairness, and explainability in conjunction, rather than individually.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and healthcare because trustworthy machine learning in clinical settings requires not only high predictive performance and fairness, but also stable and understandable explanations. If fairness interventions cause unpredictable shifts in a model's explanatory reasoning, clinicians may hesitate to adopt or rely on such models for critical patient care decisions, impeding the integration of AI into healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.</p>
