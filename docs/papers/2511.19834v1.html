                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BHD-RAG, a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome from Computed Tomography (CT) images, particularly amidst challenges of limited clinical data and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs). By integrating DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), BHD-RAG successfully mitigates hallucination risks and achieves superior diagnostic accuracy, generating evidence-based descriptions aligned with expert insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning methods face dual challenges of limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) in advancing Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) diagnosis via Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.</p>
