                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MIMM-X, a novel framework designed to combat shortcut learning in deep learning models for medical image analysis, where models often rely on spurious correlations instead of true causal features. MIMM-X achieves this by disentangling causal features from multiple spurious correlations through mutual information minimization. Evaluated across MRI and X-ray modalities on diverse datasets, the framework effectively mitigates shortcut learning, promoting predictions based on true underlying medical relationships.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>In medical imaging, diagnostic errors stemming from AI models learning spurious correlations can have life-threatening consequences. MIMM-X directly enhances patient safety and diagnostic accuracy by ensuring AI systems focus on genuine pathological markers, making medical AI more reliable and clinically trustworthy.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The MIMM-X framework is a medical AI application designed to improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models used for analyzing medical images (e.g., MRI, X-ray). By disentangling causal features from spurious correlations, it aims to make AI-powered diagnostic tools more accurate and trustworthy across different patient populations and clinical settings, preventing misdiagnoses that could arise from AI 'shortcut learning'.</p>

                    <li>Deep learning models in medical imaging frequently suffer from 'shortcut learning,' exploiting spurious correlations instead of genuine causal features, leading to poor generalization in new environments.</li>
                    
                    <li>The presence of multiple coexisting spurious correlations in medical imaging exacerbates this problem, with potential for severe misclassification consequences.</li>
                    
                    <li>MIMM-X is proposed as a framework to disentangle true causal features from these multiple spurious correlations.</li>
                    
                    <li>The core mechanism of MIMM-X involves minimizing the mutual information between the identified causal features and the spurious correlations.</li>
                    
                    <li>This disentanglement enables predictions to be based on the true underlying causal medical relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts or artifacts.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MIMM-X is a deep learning-based framework that operates by disentangling causal features from multiple spurious correlations. It achieves this by introducing an optimization objective that minimizes the mutual information between the representations of true causal features and those identified as spurious correlations. This process forces the model to learn and make predictions based on the robust, causally linked information, improving generalization.</p>

                    <p>The central finding is that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning, particularly when multiple spurious correlations are present in medical imaging datasets. This was demonstrated across diverse real-world medical datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) and imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray), indicating its broad applicability and robustness in identifying and leveraging true causal features.</p>

                <p>By creating more robust and generalizable AI models, MIMM-X can significantly improve the reliability of AI-assisted diagnostic tools in clinical settings. This will lead to more accurate diagnoses, better patient management, and reduced risk of misdiagnosis when models are deployed across different hospitals, scanner types, or patient populations, ultimately enhancing the quality and safety of medical care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learning models can excel on medical tasks, yet often experience spurious correlations, known as shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization in new environments. Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.</p>
