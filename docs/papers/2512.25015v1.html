                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the identification of depressive symptoms expressed through memes on social media platforms, a growing medium for emotional expression. It introduces RESTOREx, a vital resource for meme-based depression detection leveraging LLM-generated and human-annotated explanations. The core contribution is MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework grounded in Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies, which significantly improves macro-F1 performance by 7.55% over state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new benchmark.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Identifying depressive symptoms from user-generated content like memes on social media offers a scalable, passive screening method for mental health conditions, potentially enabling earlier detection and intervention outside traditional clinical settings. This approach can provide valuable real-world insights into emotional states, complementing existing diagnostic tools.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using multi-agent collaborative frameworks and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and identify depressive symptoms expressed through memes on online social media platforms. This could serve as a tool for early detection, screening, or monitoring of mental health issues, potentially informing mental health support or interventions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves the creation of RESTOREx, a dataset/resource populated with LLM-generated and human-annotated explanations for depressive symptoms within memes. This resource then underpins the development of MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework. This framework's design is explicitly informed by Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies, guiding the interaction and analysis performed by the agents. The efficacy of MAMAMemeia was benchmarked against over 30 existing methods using the macro-F1 score.</p>

                    <p>The MAMAMemeia framework significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for identifying depressive symptoms in memes, achieving a 7.55% improvement in macro-F1 score. This performance establishes MAMAMemeia as the new benchmark in this specific domain, demonstrating its superior capability in leveraging multi-agent collaboration and clinical insights.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research holds significant potential for proactive mental health surveillance and early intervention strategies. By enabling the automated detection of depressive symptoms from social media memes, it could aid public health initiatives, mental health practitioners, and researchers in identifying at-risk individuals who might not otherwise seek help. It offers a new avenue for large-scale, non-intrusive mental health screening that could complement traditional clinical assessments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Over the past years, memes have evolved from being exclusively a medium of humorous exchanges to one that allows users to express a range of emotions freely and easily. With the ever-growing utilization of memes in expressing depressive sentiments, we conduct a study on identifying depressive symptoms exhibited by memes shared by users of online social media platforms. We introduce RESTOREx as a vital resource for detecting depressive symptoms in memes on social media through the Large Language Model (LLM) generated and human-annotated explanations. We introduce MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework grounded in the clinical psychology method of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies. MAMAMemeia improves upon the current state-of-the-art by 7.55% in macro-F1 and is established as the new benchmark compared to over 30 methods.</p>
