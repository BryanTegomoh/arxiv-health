                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MAMAMemeia, a novel multi-agent multi-aspect collaborative framework, grounded in Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies, for identifying depressive symptoms expressed through memes on social media. Utilizing the new RESTOREx dataset, which features LLM-generated and human-annotated explanations, MAMAMemeia significantly improves depressive symptom detection, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 7.55% in macro-F1 and establishing a new benchmark among over 30 methods.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for mental health by offering an automated, early-detection mechanism for depressive symptoms through social media content. It leverages prevalent online behaviors (meme sharing) to potentially identify individuals at risk, complementing traditional screening methods and enabling timelier intervention.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a multi-agent collaborative framework (MAMAMemeia), informed by clinical psychology principles, to automatically identify and detect depressive symptoms from user-generated content (memes) on online social media platforms. This could serve as an early detection tool or a screening aid for mental health professionals.</p>

                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>Memes are increasingly used to express a wide range of emotions, including depressive sentiments, on online social media platforms.</li>
                    
                    <li>The study's primary objective is to develop a method for accurately identifying depressive symptoms exhibited in user-shared memes.</li>
                    
                    <li>RESTOREx is introduced as a critical new resource, comprising memes annotated with depressive symptoms, enriched by both Large Language Model (LLM) generated and human-verified explanations.</li>
                    
                    <li>MAMAMemeia is proposed as a collaborative, multi-agent, multi-aspect discussion framework, conceptually rooted in the clinical psychology method of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies.</li>
                    
                    <li>The MAMAMemeia framework achieves a substantial performance improvement, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods by 7.55% in macro-F1 score.</li>
                    
                    <li>MAMAMemeia has been rigorously benchmarked against more than 30 existing methods, establishing itself as the new leading benchmark for this task.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves creating the RESTOREx dataset, which includes memes with depressive symptom annotations and detailed explanations generated by LLMs and validated by humans. This dataset then trains and evaluates MAMAMemeia, a multi-agent, multi-aspect collaborative discussion framework inspired by Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies. Performance is measured using macro-F1 score and compared against over 30 existing machine learning and deep learning methods.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Over the past years, memes have evolved from being exclusively a medium of humorous exchanges to one that allows users to express a range of emotions freely and easily. With the ever-growing utilization of memes in expressing depressive sentiments, we conduct a study on identifying depressive symptoms exhibited by memes shared by users of online social media platforms. We introduce RESTOREx as a vital resource for detecting depressive symptoms in memes on social media through the Large Language Model (LLM) generated and human-annotated explanations. We introduce MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework grounded in the clinical psychology method of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies. MAMAMemeia improves upon the current state-of-the-art by 7.55% in macro-F1 and is established as the new benchmark compared to over 30 methods.</p>
