                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This AI-enabled modeling and simulation study quantifies how torso-heart anatomical factors contribute to sex-differences in ECG biomarkers following myocardial infarction. It found that female anatomies, characterized by smaller ventricles, a more superior cardiac position, and different ventricular orientation, lead to reduced ST-elevation, shorter QRS duration, and shortened T-peak-to-end interval due to increased distances and altered angles between infarcts and ECG electrodes.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for addressing sex-biased outcomes in cardiovascular diagnosis and risk stratification, particularly for myocardial infarction. By identifying anatomical contributors to ECG biomarker differences, it can improve the accuracy of ECG interpretation in female patients, potentially preventing missed diagnoses or inappropriate treatments.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper uses AI-enabled multiscale modeling and simulation to construct a large cohort of torso-ventricular anatomies from clinical MRI data. This AI-augmented approach allows for the simulation of ECGs across various anatomical variabilities and electrophysiological stages (healthy, ischemic, infarcted) to quantify the impact of anatomical sex differences on ECG biomarkers. The AI is used to mechanistically understand complex physiological interactions, leading to a blueprint for future work in tailoring clinical guidelines based on unique patient anatomy, thereby reducing diagnostic bias in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The electrocardiogram (ECG) is modulated by torso-heart anatomy, and this challenges patients' diagnosis and risk stratification. This study aims to quantify how torso-heart anatomical factors affect sex-differences in ECG biomarkers in acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI). We exploit the perfect control of AI-augmented multiscale modelling and simulation, based on clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and ECGs for model construction and validation. A cohort of 1720 torso-ventricular anatomies (50% female) was constructed from MRIs of healthy and post-MI participants in the UK Biobank study. 8600 ECG simulations were performed considering anatomical variability and 3 electrophysiological stages (healthy, acutely ischemic, and infarcted). The effect of cardiac size, position, and orientation on each ECG biomarker was quantified. Female anatomies had larger distances between the infarct and ECG electrodes (relative to cardiac size), and larger angles between the infarct normal and ECG lead axes, both primarily caused by their more superior cardiac position. This reduced ST-elevation and caused low-amplitude late depolarisation and repolarisation tails to be missed, shortening QRS duration (QRSd) and T-peak-to-end interval (TpTe). The position and orientation of the heart impacted TpTe more severely than QRSd. AI-enabled mechanistic modelling and simulation identify smaller ventricles, superior cardiac position, and different ventricular orientation as key anatomical contributors of shorter QRS and T waves, and lower ST-elevation, in female versus male anatomies. This provides a blueprint for quantifying the impact of anatomical sex differences on functional markers and enables future work in tailoring clinical guidelines considering unique patient anatomy to reduce biased outcomes.</p>
