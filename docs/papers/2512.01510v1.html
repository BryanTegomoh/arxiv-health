                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SRCSM, a novel method addressing single-source domain generalization for medical image segmentation, enabling a model trained on one domain (e.g., CT) to directly segment images from a different domain (e.g., MR) without adaptation. SRCSM achieves this by combining semantic-aware random convolution during training with test-time intensity source matching, establishing a new state-of-the-art and often matching in-domain performance across various challenging cross-modality and cross-center scenarios.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is to develop more robust and generalizable deep learning models for medical image segmentation. By improving domain generalization, the proposed method (SRCSM) helps AI models trained on limited data sources to perform reliably on diverse patient populations, different scanner types, and varying imaging protocols, thus enhancing diagnostic accuracy, automating measurement for treatment planning (e.g., tumor volume, heart chamber size), and facilitating disease monitoring in real-world clinical environments.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The SRCSM method consists of two primary components. During the training phase, 'semantic-aware random convolution' is applied, which diversifies the source domain by augmenting different regions of an image (e.g., foreground vs. background, or different anatomical structures) distinctively based on their annotation labels. Subsequently, at test-time, 'source matching' is utilized to map the intensity profiles of incoming target domain images, making them structurally similar to the source domain data the model was trained on, thereby bridging the domain shift without requiring target annotations.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>SRCSM consistently demonstrates superior performance over existing domain generalization techniques across a wide array of medical image segmentation tasks, including abdominal, whole-heart, and prostate segmentation under both cross-modality and cross-center conditions. A pivotal finding is SRCSM's ability to achieve segmentation performance that matches the in-domain baseline in multiple settings, effectively closing the performance gap between specialized models and generalized ones. Furthermore, it shows promising progress in generalizing to the more challenging scenario of cine MR data from different scanner hardware, establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p>

                <p>SRCSM has the potential to dramatically accelerate the deployment and improve the utility of AI-powered medical image segmentation tools in clinical settings. By overcoming domain shifts between different scanners, manufacturers, and imaging modalities, it reduces the burden of acquiring and annotating vast amounts of new data for each unique clinical environment, leading to more efficient workflows, increased diagnostic accuracy, and broader accessibility of advanced image analysis in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation. To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.</p>
