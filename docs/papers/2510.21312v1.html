                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a simplified and more robust approach to minimize Nash regret and its generalized form, $p$-mean regret, in stochastic multi-armed bandits, metrics designed to ensure fairness in reward distribution. It demonstrates that a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, preceded by a uniform exploration phase, achieves near-optimal performance under significantly weaker assumptions, offering a broadly applicable solution for fairness-aware decision-making.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medical and health fields, particularly in the design of adaptive clinical trials or treatment allocation strategies, where ensuring fairness in outcomes across diverse patient populations is a critical ethical and practical consideration, going beyond merely maximizing average efficacy.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research improves the theoretical underpinnings and algorithmic design for Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms, a form of reinforcement learning (AI). When applied in health, these improved MABs can be used for more ethical and fair adaptive clinical trials, where AI-driven algorithms dynamically allocate patients to different treatments to optimize outcomes while ensuring fairness in reward distribution among patient groups. This contributes to the development of robust and ethically sound AI systems for medical decision-making.</p>

                    <li>Traditional multi-armed bandit (MAB) regret metrics primarily focus on average accumulated rewards, often overlooking fairness in reward distribution among agents or populations (e.g., patients).</li>
                    
                    <li>Nash regret (geometric mean of accumulated rewards) and $p$-mean regret are presented as fairness-aware metrics, aligning with Nash social welfare principles.</li>
                    
                    <li>Existing algorithms for minimizing Nash regret rely on strong assumptions (e.g., multiplicative concentration, bounded non-negative rewards) and are not suitable for common reward distributions like Gaussian.</li>
                    
                    <li>The authors propose an algorithm combining an initial uniform exploration phase with a standard UCB algorithm.</li>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This work has the potential to significantly impact the design of future clinical trials and adaptive healthcare interventions. By providing a mathematically sound and broadly applicable method for incorporating fairness into treatment assignment algorithms, it can lead to more ethically responsible and patient-centric adaptive trials where equitable outcomes for all participant groups are prioritized alongside overall efficacy. This could improve trust in clinical research and ensure more just distribution of experimental treatments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.</p>
