                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">QuanvNeXt is an end-to-end fully quanvolutional neural network designed for EEG-based detection of major depressive disorder (MDD), incorporating a novel Cross Residual block for enhanced feature learning and parameter efficiency. The model achieved high diagnostic performance with 93.1% accuracy and 97.2% AUC-ROC on two datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art models, while also demonstrating well-calibrated predictions and interpretable identification of disease-specific spectrotemporal patterns. This establishes QuanvNeXt as an efficient and reliable approach for objective MDD diagnosis.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study developed QuanvNeXt, an end-to-end fully quanvolutional neural network, incorporating a novel Cross Residual block for enhanced feature learning and parameter efficiency. The model was trained and evaluated on two open-source EEG datasets for binary classification (Major Depressive Disorder vs. healthy controls). Performance was measured using average accuracy and AUC-ROC, comparing QuanvNeXt against state-of-the-art baselines like InceptionTime. Additional analyses included uncertainty quantification through ECE scores under varying Gaussian noise perturbations and post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) to confirm the model's ability to identify relevant spectrotemporal patterns.</p>

                    <p>QuanvNeXt achieved an average accuracy of 93.1% and an average AUC-ROC of 97.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, including InceptionTime. It demonstrated robust and well-calibrated predictions, with ECE scores ranging from low (0.0436) to moderate (0.1159) even under substantial data perturbation. Furthermore, an Explainable AI analysis confirmed that the model effectively learns and leverages spectrotemporal patterns within EEG signals that are discriminative for Major Depressive Disorder.</p>

                <p>The development of QuanvNeXt offers a promising objective and interpretable diagnostic aid for Major Depressive Disorder. Its high accuracy, robustness, and ability to highlight specific neurophysiological markers could lead to more consistent and earlier diagnoses, reducing diagnostic delays and variability associated with subjective assessments. This could facilitate more timely therapeutic interventions and monitoring, potentially improving treatment efficacy and patient quality of life.</p>

                <p class="abstract">This study presents QuanvNeXt, an end-to-end fully quanvolutional model for EEG-based depression diagnosis. QuanvNeXt incorporates a novel Cross Residual block, which reduces feature homogeneity and strengthens cross-feature relationships while retaining parameter efficiency. We evaluated QuanvNeXt on two open-source datasets, where it achieved an average accuracy of 93.1% and an average AUC-ROC of 97.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as InceptionTime (91.7% accuracy, 95.9% AUC-ROC). An uncertainty analysis across Gaussian noise levels demonstrated well-calibrated predictions, with ECE scores remaining low (0.0436, Dataset 1) to moderate (0.1159, Dataset 2) even at the highest perturbation (ε = 0.1). Additionally, a post-hoc explainable AI analysis confirmed that QuanvNeXt effectively identifies and learns spectrotemporal patterns that distinguish between healthy controls and major depressive disorder. Overall, QuanvNeXt establishes an efficient and reliable approach for EEG-based depression diagnosis.</p>
