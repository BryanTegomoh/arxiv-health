                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a Virtual Inking Network (VIN), a deep learning model designed for autonomous and standardized localization of surgical resection margins on whole-slide images (WSIs). VIN utilizes a frozen foundation model for feature extraction and a multilayer perceptron for classifying cautery-consistent features, demonstrating ~73.3% region-level accuracy on human tonsil tissue. This method offers a reproducible, ink-free alternative to traditional physical inking, enhancing digital pathology workflows.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The Virtual Inking Network (VIN) is a deep learning architecture that combines a pre-trained (frozen) foundation model for robust feature extraction from whole-slide image patches with a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP). This MLP is specifically trained for binary patch-level classification, identifying histological features indicative of cautery, which demarcate the surgical cut surface. The model was trained on a large dataset of pathologist-annotated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images of human tonsil tissue.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.</p>
