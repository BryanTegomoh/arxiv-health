                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates how visual attention patterns in medical image signal detection tasks are influenced by the spatial frequency properties of both the signal (lesion) and the complex background. Using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images, the study found that detection errors primarily stem from decision failures at later perceptual stages, and that visual attention engagement, evidenced by fixation duration, adapts based on the interplay between lesion morphology and anatomical noise.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research directly addresses the issue of misdiagnosis in medical imaging, particularly in breast cancer detection via DBT. By dissecting the influence of image characteristics on visual attention and detection failures, it provides crucial insights to enhance diagnostic accuracy, potentially informing radiologist training, image optimization, and the development of more effective computer-aided detection (CAD) systems.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Although this paper focuses on human visual attention, the understanding of visual search and signal detection challenges in complex medical images (like DBT for lesions) is foundational for medical AI. Insights into why humans struggle ('decision failures', 'interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise') can directly inform the development, training, and evaluation of medical AI algorithms designed for automated or assisted lesion detection in diagnostic imaging. It highlights critical factors that AI models would need to account for to improve diagnostic accuracy and robustness.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved an observer study utilizing simulated digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images derived from Bakic and XCAT digital breast phantoms to create diverse breast densities and structures. Two types of lesions—a 3-mm sphere and a 6-mm spicule, each with distinct spatial frequency properties—were randomly inserted into the phantoms. Six human observers participated in a task requiring the locating and detection of these lesions in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. Eye-gaze data was collected from these observers to estimate gaze metrics and analyze differences in visual attention mechanisms.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings indicate that detection performance limitations in complex visual environments are predominantly attributed to decision failures occurring at later perceptual stages. Signal detectability is not an isolated factor but is jointly influenced by the lesion's morphology and the complexity of the background anatomical noise, revealing a critical interaction between these elements. Furthermore, the study observed an increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions, demonstrating that visual attention is engaged differently based on the dependencies between background and signal spatial frequencies.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Understanding that decision failures are a major source of error and how visual attention shifts with lesion and background characteristics can lead to significant clinical improvements. This insight can refine radiologist training programs, focusing on perceptual and decision-making strategies. It also has the potential to guide the development of more sophisticated computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that can better account for the interplay between lesion features and anatomical noise, ultimately aiming to reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes in complex screening scenarios like breast cancer detection.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.</p>
