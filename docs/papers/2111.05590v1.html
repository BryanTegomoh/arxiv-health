                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a novel mathematical model on time-varying networks to analyze the spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in partially vaccinated populations, integrating realistic features like differential vaccine effectiveness, testing, NPIs, isolation, and human behavior. Using a mean-field approach, it analytically derives the epidemic threshold and endemic prevalence, revealing that while vaccination generally mitigates severe cases, it can paradoxically contribute to resurgent outbreaks in certain realistic scenarios. The study emphasizes the critical roles of precautious human behavior and effective testing in preventing outbreaks and achieving eradication.</p>

                <p>This research offers crucial quantitative insights for public health policy by modeling the complex interplay between vaccination, human behavior, and epidemic dynamics, informing adaptive strategies required to mitigate disease spread and prevent post-vaccination resurgent outbreaks in real-world partially immune populations.</p>

                <p>The paper uses mathematical modeling (mean-field approach) rather than AI. While the insights from this model could potentially inform the development of AI-driven predictive models or intervention optimization tools in health, the paper itself does not describe an AI application.</p>

                    <li>The model incorporates several realistic features: differential vaccine effectiveness against transmission versus severe symptoms, testing practices, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), isolation of detected individuals, and human behavioral responses.</li>
                    
                    <li>A mean-field approach is employed to analytically derive the epidemic threshold of the model and, if above threshold, compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium.</li>

                    <p>The study utilizes a mathematical modeling framework built upon time-varying networks to simulate disease transmission dynamics.

                    <p>The model's analytical results demonstrate that both robust testing practices and cautious human behavior are paramount for effectively avoiding epidemic outbreaks. While vaccination successfully reduces the burden of severe illness, it can paradoxically contribute to resurgent outbreaks under specific conditions. Consequently, achieving complete disease eradication often requires supplemental measures such as intensified testing, heightened public vigilance, or the re-implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

                <p>The findings have direct clinical and public health implications, advocating for dynamic public health strategies that extend beyond vaccination alone. They underscore the sustained importance of testing, targeted behavioral interventions, and the potential for adaptive re-application of NPIs to effectively manage disease transmission and prevent post-vaccination surges, particularly relevant for evolving pathogens or varying population immunity levels.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Motivated by the increasing number of COVID-19 cases that have been observed in many countries after the vaccination and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we propose a mathematical model on time-varying networks for the spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in a partially vaccinated population. The model encapsulates several realistic features, such as the different effectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and development of severe symptoms, testing practices, the possible implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the transmission, isolation of detected individuals, and human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is above such a threshold, we compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium. These theoretical results show that precautious human behaviour and effective testing practices are key toward avoiding epidemic outbreaks. Interestingly, we found that, in many realistic scenarios, vaccination is successful in mitigating the outbreak by reducing the prevalence of seriously ill patients, but it could be a double-edged sword, whereby in some cases it might favour resurgent outbreaks, calling for higher testing rates, more cautiousness and responsibility among the population, or the reintroduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions to achieve complete eradication.</p>
