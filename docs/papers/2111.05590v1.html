                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a mathematical model on time-varying networks to analyze the spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in partially vaccinated populations, considering various realistic factors like differential vaccine effectiveness, testing, NPIs, and human behavior. It analytically derives the epidemic threshold and endemic prevalence, revealing that while vaccination mitigates severe illness, it can paradoxically contribute to resurgent outbreaks in certain scenarios, necessitating enhanced testing, public caution, or NPI reintroduction for complete eradication.</p>

While vaccination successfully mitigates severe illness, it can paradoxically contribute to resurgent outbreaks in certain realistic scenarios. Consequently, achieving complete eradication may require continued high testing rates, greater population caution, or the reintroduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

It suggests healthcare systems and public health agencies must be prepared for dynamic policy adjustments, potentially re-implementing NPIs or enhancing testing, even in highly vaccinated populations, to manage or prevent resurgent outbreaks and reduce the burden of severe disease.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Motivated by the increasing number of COVID-19 cases that have been observed in many countries after the vaccination and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we propose a mathematical model on time-varying networks for the spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in a partially vaccinated population. The model encapsulates several realistic features, such as the different effectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and development of severe symptoms, testing practices, the possible implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the transmission, isolation of detected individuals, and human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is above such a threshold, we compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium. These theoretical results show that precautious human behaviour and effective testing practices are key toward avoiding epidemic outbreaks. Interestingly, we found that, in many realistic scenarios, vaccination is successful in mitigating the outbreak by reducing the prevalence of seriously ill patients, but it could be a double-edged sword, whereby in some cases it might favour resurgent outbreaks, calling for higher testing rates, more cautiousness and responsibility among the population, or the reintroduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions to achieve complete eradication.</p>
