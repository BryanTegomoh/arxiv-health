                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The implementation of advanced deep learning models, particularly Vision Transformers, or hybrid human-AI frameworks in clinical practice could standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation for adnexal masses. This could lead to a significant reduction in inter-observer variability, lower rates of false positives (thereby decreasing unnecessary biopsies and surgeries), and a substantial improvement in the early and accurate detection of high-risk malignant lesions, ultimately optimizing patient care and resource allocation.</p>

                <p>The study's single-center, retrospective design inherently limits the generalizability of its findings, as performance may vary across different institutions, patient populations, and ultrasound equipment. The abstract does not detail external validation on an independent dataset, which is crucial for assessing real-world applicability.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated, the findings suggest future research should focus on prospective, multi-center validation studies to confirm the generalizability and robustness of these DL models and hybrid frameworks. Further exploration into the explainability of these complex AI models and their seamless integration into existing clinical workflows would also be critical for widespread adoption.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: The 2022 update of the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System
(O-RADS) ultrasound classification refines risk stratification for adnexal
lesions, yet human interpretation remains subject to variability and
conservative thresholds. Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have
demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study
evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading
convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and
investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks.
Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512
adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst)
were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets,
VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model
integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also
built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an
AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620
to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best
performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI
frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models;
however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant
(P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only
O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields
the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms
hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation,
reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.</p>
