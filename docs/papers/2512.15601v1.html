                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces PsyDefConv, a novel dialogue corpus, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pre-annotation pipeline, designed to detect levels of psychological defense mechanisms in supportive conversations. The research addresses the challenge of reliably measuring these complex defenses in clinical dialogues, demonstrating that the co-pilot significantly reduces annotation time while current language models show considerable headroom for accurate detection.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved creating the PsyDefConv dialogue corpus through human labeling of help-seeker utterances for defense levels. A DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline, was developed for generating evidence-based pre-annotations. Its efficacy was evaluated via a counterbalanced study measuring annotation time reduction and an expert review for clinical quality. Finally, strong language models were benchmarked on the corpus in zero-shot and fine-tuning configurations to assess their performance on defense mechanism detection.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The PsyDefConv corpus was successfully created with reliable human annotations (Cohen's kappa 0.639). The DMRS Co-Pilot significantly streamlined the annotation process (22.4% time reduction) and was highly rated by experts for its clinical utility. Current advanced language models struggle with this task, achieving only a ~30% macro F1-score and exhibiting a bias towards overpredicting mature defenses. Analysis of the corpus showed that mature defenses are prevalent and display emotion-specific variations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by providing a foundation for automated tools that can assist therapists in identifying psychological defense mechanisms. Such tools could enhance therapeutic assessment, enable more targeted interventions, improve understanding of patient disclosure and resistance, and potentially inform treatment planning and progress monitoring in psychotherapy and mental health counseling.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>A primary limitation is the current low performance of strong language models (macro F1 ~30%) in accurately detecting defense mechanisms, indicating the significant complexity of the task. The observed tendency of LMs to overpredict mature defenses also suggests a challenge in fine-grained differentiation between defense levels or potential biases in current AI approaches.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>Future research should focus on improving the performance of language models for defense mechanism detection, potentially through novel architectures or more sophisticated fine-tuning strategies. Further exploration of emotion-specific defense patterns identified in the corpus could yield deeper psychological insights. Integrating such robust detection systems into clinical decision support tools and expanding the corpus to include more diverse clinical populations and dialogue types are also promising avenues.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, that people use to manage distress. Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and shapes what speakers disclose and how they accept or resist help. However, defenses are complex and difficult to reliably measure, particularly in clinical dialogues. We introduce PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances labeled for defense level, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline that provides evidence-based pre-annotations. The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analyses confirm that mature defenses are most common and reveal emotion-specific deviations. We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research on defensive functioning in language.</p>
