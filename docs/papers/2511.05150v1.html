                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>JWTH is a Pathology Foundation Model built upon a hierarchical token architecture. It leverages large-scale self-supervised pretraining to learn robust visual features from H&E slides. This is complemented by a cell-centric post-tuning phase that specifically refines the model's understanding of cellular morphology. The core innovation lies in its attention pooling mechanism, which dynamically fuses fine-grained local (cell-level) tokens with broader global (patch-level) tokens, creating a rich, multi-scale representation for biomarker inference.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">AI-based biomarkers can infer molecular features directly from hematoxylin &
eosin (H&E) slides, yet most pathology foundation models (PFMs) rely on global
patch-level embeddings and overlook cell-level morphology. We present a PFM
model, JWTH (Joint-Weighted Token Hierarchy), which integrates large-scale
self-supervised pretraining with cell-centric post-tuning and attention pooling
to fuse local and global tokens. Across four tasks involving four biomarkers
and eight cohorts, JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and 1.2%
average improvement over prior PFMs, advancing interpretable and robust
AI-based biomarker detection in digital pathology.</p>
