                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent linguistic uncertainty in medical text, a crucial aspect for diagnostic interpretation and decision-making. By introducing a layerwise probing metric, Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), and a contrastive dataset, the authors found that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity, progressively encoding epistemic information in deeper layers. These findings reveal critical insights into the interpretability and epistemic reliability of LLMs in clinical contexts.</p>

This research directly impacts the safe and effective integration of LLMs into healthcare by ensuring they can properly discern and internally represent these crucial epistemic nuances, thereby reducing potential errors in AI-assisted clinical reasoning.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved curating a contrastive dataset of clinical statements, where pairs of statements differed only in their epistemic modality to isolate the effect of uncertainty cues. To assess LLM sensitivity, the authors proposed Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric. MSU quantifies the shifts in activation levels within different layers of the LLM's internal representations when processing the subtle variations in certainty introduced by the dataset. This layerwise analysis allowed them to pinpoint where epistemic information is encoded.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, where sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty can influence diagnostic interpretation and decision-making. Yet little is known about where such epistemic cues are internally represented within these models. Distinct from uncertainty quantification, which measures output confidence, this work examines input-side representational sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text. We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers. These findings reveal how linguistic uncertainty is internally represented in LLMs, offering insight into their interpretability and epistemic reliability.</p>
