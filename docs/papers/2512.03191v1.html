                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This comprehensive review synthesizes the critical role of Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) as a post-translational regulator within the Drosophila circadian clock, specifically detailing its impact on PER protein dynamics (phosphorylation, stability, nuclear entry, degradation). It highlights how CK2 dysregulation in flies not only disrupts circadian rhythms but also models broader pathological processes relevant to human health, including cancer, metabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding the precise regulatory role of CK2 in circadian timing, as elucidated in Drosophila, is crucial because circadian disruption is increasingly linked to a wide range of human diseases. This research provides a foundational molecular mechanism that can inform therapeutic strategies for pathologies like cancer, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and psychiatric illnesses where circadian rhythms are compromised.</p>

                <p>The abstract mentions 'insights from computational modelling of CK2-PER dynamics'. While this indicates the use of computational methods, it does not explicitly describe an AI application for medical diagnosis, treatment, or personalized health. Computational modelling can be a foundational component for AI, but by itself, it is a scientific tool for understanding dynamics rather than a direct AI *application* to health in the sense of predictive analytics, diagnostics, or therapeutic recommendations.</p>

                    <p>The central finding of the reviewed research is that CK2 is a critical post-translational regulator of the PER protein, dictating its phosphorylation, stability, nuclear entry, and degradation, which are all essential for setting circadian rhythmicity. Importantly, dysregulation of CK2 and subsequent PER phosphorylation directly leads to circadian disruption and is implicated in the pathogenesis of various human conditions including cancer, metabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a deeper mechanistic understanding of how a key kinase, CK2, controls circadian rhythmicity through PER protein. This knowledge could lead to the identification of CK2 or its downstream PER targets as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for interventions aimed at correcting circadian disruption in associated diseases. Modulating CK2 activity might offer novel treatment avenues for cancer, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-hour oscillations that regulate physiology, metabolism, sleep-wake cycles, and cellular homeostasis. Drosophila melanogaster, a genetically tractable model organism, has played a foundational role in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms. The discovery of major clock genes, including period (per), timeless (tim), clock (clk), cycle (cyc), double time (dbt), and regulators such as Casein kinase 2 (CK2), emerged primarily from Drosophila research. CK2 operates as a critical post-translational regulator of PER protein phosphorylation, stability, nuclear entry, and degradation. Because PER dynamics dictate the timing and robustness of circadian rhythms in both flies and mammals, altered CK2 activity can profoundly impact rhythmic behaviour. CK2 dysregulation contributes not only to circadian disruption in Drosophila but also models broader pathological processes relevant to cancer, metabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders. This review synthesises CK2's molecular role in the Drosophila clock system, includes insights from computational modelling of CK2-PER dynamics, integrates tables throughout the text, and summarises the implications of dysregulated PER phosphorylation for human health.</p>
