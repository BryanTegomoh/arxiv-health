                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigates the sensory-to-association (AS) cortical hierarchy in schizophrenia using fMRI data and computational modeling. It reveals that schizophrenia patients exhibit a compressed AS hierarchy, indicating reduced functional differentiation and attenuated neural timescales, which mechanistically contributes to destabilized neural computations as evidenced by less stable fixed points in gradient-regularized recurrent neural networks.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Schizophrenia significantly compresses the AS hierarchy, leading to reduced functional differentiation. Specialized brain regions, typically exhibiting longer neural time constants, show attenuated (flattened) dynamics in schizophrenia. Computationally, RNNs with greater AS gradient spread learned more efficiently, achieved lower task loss, and maintained stronger alignment to hierarchical geometry. Fixed point analysis of these high-range RNNs revealed more stable neural states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues. This links cortical de-differentiation to destabilized neural computations in schizophrenia.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This study provides a mechanistic framework for understanding cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, suggesting that impaired cortical functional differentiation leads to computational instability. This deepened understanding could contribute to the development of novel neuroimaging biomarkers for schizophrenia, assist in stratifying patients based on brain architectural features, and potentially inspire new computational or neurofeedback-based therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring cortical hierarchical organization and computational stability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a
continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the
AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls.
Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via
spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation
by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We
found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced
functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally
cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time
constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation,
we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient
spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained
stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point
linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural
states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal
Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links
large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a
mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural
computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale
flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.</p>
