                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigated the sensory-to-association (AS) cortical hierarchy in schizophrenia patients compared to controls, revealing a compressed hierarchy and reduced functional differentiation in patients. Using fMRI, neural timescale modeling, and gradient-regularized recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the research demonstrated that this de-differentiation leads to flattened neural timescales and less stable neural computations, offering a mechanistic explanation for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.</p>

                    <p>Schizophrenia patients exhibited a compressed AS cortical hierarchy, indicating reduced functional differentiation. Specialized brain regions in healthy controls demonstrated longer neural time constants, an effect attenuated in schizophrenia. Gradient-regularized RNNs with greater hierarchical spread learned more efficiently, showed lower task loss, and better aligned with the AS geometry. Fixed point analysis of these RNNs revealed that higher gradient spread led to more stable neural states during memory delay, characterized by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research enhances our understanding of the neuropathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly how abnormalities in large-scale cortical organization affect cognitive function. It opens avenues for developing fMRI-based biomarkers to diagnose or monitor schizophrenia progression based on AS gradient characteristics or neural timescale alterations. Furthermore, the mechanistic framework could guide the development of computational models for personalized treatment strategies, potentially identifying targets for cognitive remediation interventions aimed at restoring functional differentiation and computational stability.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, the recurrent neural network model provides a *mechanistic account* rather than direct biological proof of causation within the human brain, which typically requires further validation through direct biological experiments. The generalizability of findings from working memory tasks to the full spectrum of schizophrenia's complex symptomatology may also require further investigation.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state future directions. Nevertheless, the established mechanistic framework could guide future research into identifying specific neural circuits or molecular targets implicated in functional de-differentiation in schizophrenia. This could lead to developing computational models for predicting individual patient responses to treatments or exploring how pharmacological or cognitive interventions might restore hierarchical stability and improve cognitive function.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a
continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the
AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls.
Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via
spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation
by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We
found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced
functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally
cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time
constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation,
we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient
spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained
stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point
linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural
states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal
Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links
large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a
mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural
computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale
flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.</p>
