                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenge of modeling time-evolving biological dynamics in oncology, particularly in scenarios with sparse experimental data where traditional fixed-parameter models are insufficient. It proposes utilizing a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to learn time-varying interactions between cell subpopulations, such as bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their responses to combination anticancer treatments. The approach successfully predicts subpopulation trajectories consistent with biological explanations, offering a novel framework for understanding dynamic biological systems under external interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to learn time-varying interactions between cancer cells (bladder cancer tumors) and immune cells, and their response to anticancer treatments.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) architecture. This approach integrates the known underlying biological dynamics, expressed as differential equations (the 'physics' component), directly into the neural network training process. By combining this biological knowledge with sparse observational data (e.g., tumor volume at specific time points), the PINN learns the time-varying parameters that govern the interactions between distinct cell subpopulations (e.g., tumor and immune cells) and their responses to therapeutic interventions. This allows for the robust prediction of continuous subpopulation trajectories across time, even in data-scarce environments.</p>

A crucial aspect of this success is the verification that the predicted trajectories are consistent with established biological explanations, indicating the model's validity and ability to accurately capture dynamic cellular behaviors under intervention.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This methodology offers significant potential for clinical impact by enabling more accurate and dynamic predictions of patient responses to combination therapies for bladder cancer and potentially other malignancies. It could guide clinicians in selecting optimal drug combinations, dosing schedules, and treatment durations, particularly for patients with limited pre-treatment or on-treatment data. Furthermore, it could accelerate drug development by providing a sophisticated in silico platform for evaluating novel therapeutic strategies and identifying potential resistance mechanisms, ultimately contributing to more personalized and effective cancer treatments.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated in the abstract, typical limitations for such approaches might include the reliance on accurately formulated underlying biological differential equations, the potential for computational intensity with increasing model complexity, and the need for rigorous experimental validation to confirm predictions beyond consistency with existing biological explanations. The generalizability of the learned dynamics across diverse patient populations or different cancer types would also require further investigation.</p>

This suggests future work could involve applying this PINN framework to a broader range of cancer types or other biological systems requiring dynamic modeling under intervention. Further directions might include integrating more diverse data modalities (e.g., genomic, proteomic), enhancing the model's predictive power for individual patient outcomes, developing rigorous uncertainty quantification for predictions, and ultimately, prospective validation in preclinical and clinical settings to translate its insights into actionable medical strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.</p>
