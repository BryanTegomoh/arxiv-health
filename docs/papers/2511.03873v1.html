                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has transformed immunotherapy
for resistant cancers, yet it faces major limitations such as lack of
persistence, toxicity, exhaustion, and antigen-negative relapse. Enhancing CAR
T cells with genetic circuitry and synthetic receptors offers solutions to some
of these problems, but often the theoretical design space is too large to
explore experimentally. Mathematical modeling offers a powerful framework for
addressing these translational bottlenecks by linking mechanistic understanding
to design optimization and clinical application.
  This perspective embeds modeling methodologies within the therapeutic
problems they aim to solve, framing the discussion around key translational
challenges rather than modeling techniques. We critically evaluate the
strengths, limitations, and data gaps of current approaches emphasizing how
modeling supports the development of safer and more effective therapies. We
highlight emerging approaches such as multiscale modeling, control theory, and
data-driven methods that leverage high-dimensional datasets to guide predictive
design, and we point toward underexplored areas in immune cell therapy
including CAR NK and CAR macrophages as future modeling frontiers. We hope that
the themes explored in this perspective will encourage readers to refine
predictive models, enabling researchers to optimize CAR T cell therapies at the
genetic, cellular, microenvironmental, and patient level to enhance their
clinical performance.</p>
