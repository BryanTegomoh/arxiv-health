                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a retrospective and prospective design. A 3D UNet deep learning model was trained on 560 thoracic CT scans, with subsequent internal validation (n=70) and external validation (n=283) to assess geometric accuracy (Dice/ASSD) and concordance of dose-volume parameters (e.g., LAD V15). Clinical utility was established by correlating AI-derived substructure metrics with patient outcomes (MACE, ACM). The system was then implemented in two phases: retrospective analysis of 3,399 lung cancer patients to track dose trends and identify high-risk exposures, and prospective surveillance of 1,386 consecutive patients for real-time cardiac toxicity risk alerts.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The AI system achieved high segmentation accuracy for the heart (Dice 0.95, ASSD 1.1 mm) and LAD (Dice 0.87, ASSD 1.9 mm), with a median absolute difference of 1% in LAD V15 compared to manual methods. AI-derived LAD V15 was independently associated with MACE (HR 1.03) and ACM (HR 1.02).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Importance: Coronary algorithm for cardiac sub structures and prospective real-time surveillance of cardiac dose exposure. Methods: Retro and prospective study to validate AI auto-segmentation. A 3D UNet was trained on 560 thoracic CT scans from a single institution (2003-2014) and validated internally (n=70). External validation was performed in 283 patients treated at an independent institution (2005-2020). Clinical implementation comprised (1) retrospective analysis of 3,399 lung cancer patients treated in 2014-2022 and (2) prospective surveillance of 1,386 consecutive patients in 2023. Geometric accuracy, concordance of dose-volume parameters; association of AI-derived substructure metrics with outcome; temporal dose trends; and the proportion of patients exceeding prespecified risk. Results: Median (inter-quartile range) Dice/ASSD were 0.95 (0.94-0.96)/1.1 mm for the heart and 0.87 (0.82-0.90)/1.9 mm for the LAD; the median absolute difference between AI and manual LAD V15 was 1%. AI-derived LAD V15 remained independently associated with MACE (sub distribution hazard ratio [HR], 1.03%; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05) and ACM (adjusted HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03), internally and externally. Retrospective deployment showed a 32% relative decline in median LAD V15 from 2014 to 2022 (12% to 8%) and identified high- risk doses in 1,086 of 3,399 patients (32%). Prospective surveillance flagged 264 contemporary patients (19%) for potential cardiology referral. Conclusions: A validated AI system accurately segments cardiac substructures, reproduces dose-outcome relationships, enables large-scale surveillance, and point-of-care alerts for high-risk patients. Automated cardiac dose monitoring could facilitate adoption of coronary-sparing therapy and follow-up.</p>
