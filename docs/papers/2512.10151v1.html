                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel conditioning signal, derived from wavelet-based vectorization of persistent homology, aimed at improving the external performance and generalizability of mammography models for breast cancer detection. By integrating these stable, multi-scale topological maps as input channels, the method significantly enhanced patient-level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 on an independent digital mammography cohort (INbreast) when augmenting a ConvNeXt Tiny model, demonstrating increased robustness across diverse data sources.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves generating a 'conditioning signal' using a wavelet-based vectorization of persistent homology, a technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This process extracts stable, multi-scale representations of image structure that persist across various intensity thresholds. These topological maps are then concatenated as additional input channels to a deep learning model (e.g., ConvNeXt Tiny) within a two-stage detection pipeline. The model is trained on a US digitized film mammography dataset (CBIS DDSM) and evaluated for external performance on independent full-field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with patient-level AUC as the primary metric.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation. The model is trained and validated on the CBIS DDSM digitized film mammography cohort from the United States and evaluated on two independent full field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with performance reported at the patient level. On INbreast, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increases patient level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under a limited training budget.</p>
