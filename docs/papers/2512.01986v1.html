                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study collected simultaneous triaxial wrist accelerometry data from three different devices alongside polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adult patients at a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Features were extracted from 30-second epochs of accelerometry data. A deep learning model was trained as a 3-class classifier (wake, sleep, sleep with arousals), which was then collapsed into a binary wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To specifically improve wake detection, the model was strategically trained on a subset of subjects exhibiting low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device, followed by testing on the remaining recordings. Model performance was assessed using F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with PSG-derived sleep metrics.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The deep learning model demonstrated high overall performance with an F1 Score of 0.86, a sensitivity for sleep of 0.87, and a specificity for wakefulness of 0.78. It showed significant and moderate correlation with PSG for predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Crucially, the model's performance proved robust to the presence of common sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, periodic limb movements in sleep) and was consistent across all three different models of wrist accelerometers used in the study.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This robust and generalizable deep learning model significantly advances the capabilities of actigraphy for sleep-wake determination. It offers a more accurate, accessible, and scalable method for objective sleep assessment in clinical practice, reducing reliance on costly and labor-intensive PSG for routine monitoring or screening. Its device-agnostic nature and effectiveness across diverse patient populations (including those with sleep disorders) facilitate broader adoption in personalized sleep medicine, remote patient monitoring, and the development of more reliable digital health solutions for sleep health management.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Study Objectives: Wrist accelerometry is widely used for inferring sleep-wake state. Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.</p>
