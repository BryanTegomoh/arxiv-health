                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a cohort of 453 adults undergoing clinical PSG at a tertiary sleep center, collecting simultaneous triaxial wrist accelerometry data from three distinct devices. Features were extracted from 30-second epochs. A deep learning model was initially trained to differentiate between wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, then collapsed to a binary wake/sleep output via a decision tree. A targeted training approach on subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index was employed to specifically enhance wake detection. The model's performance was evaluated against PSG and tested for generalizability across devices and robustness in populations with various sleep disorders.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This robust and generalizable deep learning model offers a non-invasive, cost-effective, and accurate alternative to PSG for long-term sleep-wake monitoring in clinical and research settings. It can significantly improve the diagnosis, management, and longitudinal assessment of sleep disorders, particularly in primary care or home-based settings where PSG is impractical, and enhance precision in epidemiological sleep studies by providing reliable data across diverse populations and devices.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Study Objectives: Wrist accelerometry is widely used for inferring sleep-wake state. Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.</p>
