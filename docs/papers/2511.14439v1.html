                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MedBench v4 introduces a robust, cloud-based benchmark with over 700,000 expert-curated tasks across 24 primary and 91 secondary Chinese medical specialties to evaluate LLMs, multimodal models, and intelligent agents. The study reveals significant performance gaps in base LLMs and multimodal models, particularly in safety/ethics and cross-modal reasoning, while demonstrating that governance-aware agentic orchestration substantially improves end-to-end clinical readiness and safety. This platform offers a practical reference for auditing medical AI, aligned with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MedBench v4 is a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure. It comprises over 700,000 expert-curated tasks, developed and reviewed by clinicians from more than 500 institutions through multi-stage refinement and multi-round review. Dedicated evaluation tracks are provided for LLMs, multimodal models, and intelligent agents. Open-ended model responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge system, which is calibrated to human ratings. The tasks are aligned with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Base LLMs achieved a mean overall score of 54.1/100, with a critical deficiency in safety and ethics (18.4/100). Multimodal models performed worse overall (mean 47.5/100), exhibiting solid perception but weak cross-modal reasoning. In contrast, intelligent agents built on the same backbones substantially improved end-to-end performance to a mean of 79.8/100, with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving 85.3/100 overall and significantly boosting safety scores to 88.9/100. This indicates persistent gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, yet demonstrates the effectiveness of governance-aware agentic orchestration in enhancing clinical readiness and safety.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>MedBench v4 provides a practical, robust reference tool for hospitals, AI developers, and policymakers to audit and guide the development of medical AI, ensuring alignment with real clinical workflows and safety constraints. The findings underscore the urgency for developers to improve the safety, ethics, and cross-modal reasoning of foundational models. Crucially, the substantial performance and safety improvements observed with intelligent agents offer a clear direction for the responsible and effective deployment of AI in clinical settings, especially given its alignment with Chinese regulatory priorities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.</p>
