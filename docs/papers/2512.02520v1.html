                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This dissertation addresses the 'consistent anomalies' problem in zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS), a failure mode where recurring similar anomalies bias detection methods. It introduces CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework leveraging novel phenomena (similarity scaling, neighbor-burnout) to filter these anomalies. The work extends this capability to 3D medical imaging via a training-free volumetric tokenization strategy and bridges batch-based with text-based zero-shot methods, providing both theoretical understanding and practical solutions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medical imaging because it offers a truly zero-shot approach for detecting and segmenting anomalies in 3D MRI data, critical for diagnostics where annotated anomaly datasets are often scarce or non-existent.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is the development of zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tools for medical images (especially 3D MRI data). This enables automated identification of abnormalities (e.g., tumors, lesions, anatomical variations) without requiring large, pre-labeled datasets for training. This can significantly aid radiologists and clinicians in diagnosis, improve efficiency, and potentially allow for earlier detection of diseases, particularly in scenarios with rare conditions or limited annotated data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.</p>
