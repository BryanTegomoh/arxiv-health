                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper systematically evaluates the Stable Diffusion VAE (SD-VAE) for reconstructing high-dimensional Cell Painting microscopy images, a critical task in phenotypic drug discovery. It demonstrates that SD-VAE effectively preserves phenotypic signals with minimal loss, affirming the suitability of general-purpose generative models for complex biological image analysis. The study further shows that readily available feature extractors like InceptionV3 can match or surpass specialized models in retrieval tasks, thereby simplifying and streamlining future bioimage analysis pipelines.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves using advanced generative models (specifically, Stable Diffusion's VAE) to compress and reconstruct high-dimensional microscopy image data from phenotypic drug screens. This enables the preservation of crucial 'phenotypic signals' (biological effects of drugs/perturbations) for more effective analysis and retrieval tasks, thereby accelerating and improving the identification of potential drug candidates in phenotypic drug discovery pipelines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">High-throughput phenotypic screens generate vast microscopy image datasets
that push the limits of generative models due to their large dimensionality.
Despite the growing popularity of general-purpose models trained on natural
images for microscopy data analysis, their suitability in this domain has not
been quantitatively demonstrated. We present the first systematic evaluation of
Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing Cell
Painting images, assessing performance across a large dataset with diverse
molecular perturbations and cell types. We find that SD-VAE reconstructions
preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy
workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level,
embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically
informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like
InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval
tasks, simplifying future pipelines. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for evaluating generative models on microscopy data and support the use of
off-the-shelf models in phenotypic drug discovery.</p>
