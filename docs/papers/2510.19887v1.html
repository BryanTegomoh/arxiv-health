                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper systematically evaluates the Stable Diffusion's Variational Autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing high-dimensional microscopy images from Cell Painting screens, which are central to phenotypic drug discovery. It quantitatively demonstrates that SD-VAE effectively preserves phenotypic signals with minimal loss, validating the use of general-purpose generative models in this domain. Furthermore, the study shows that off-the-shelf feature extractors like InceptionV3 perform comparably or superiorly to bespoke models in biological retrieval tasks, offering practical guidelines to simplify future drug discovery pipelines.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">High-throughput phenotypic screens generate vast microscopy image datasets
that push the limits of generative models due to their large dimensionality.
Despite the growing popularity of general-purpose models trained on natural
images for microscopy data analysis, their suitability in this domain has not
been quantitatively demonstrated. We present the first systematic evaluation of
Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing Cell
Painting images, assessing performance across a large dataset with diverse
molecular perturbations and cell types. We find that SD-VAE reconstructions
preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy
workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level,
embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically
informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like
InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval
tasks, simplifying future pipelines. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for evaluating generative models on microscopy data and support the use of
off-the-shelf models in phenotypic drug discovery.</p>
