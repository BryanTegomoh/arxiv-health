                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods designed to boost predictive performance on tabular data suffering from severe class imbalance, particularly for rare but important minority classes. By leveraging conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees and operating in compact latent spaces, the proposed variants (PCAForest, EmbedForest, AttentionForest) generate high-fidelity synthetic data. AttentionForest demonstrates superior minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and privacy across diverse datasets, including those from healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine and health because many critical medical conditions or outcomes are rare, leading to severe class imbalance in clinical datasets. Accurately predicting these minority classes (e.g., rare diseases, adverse drug reactions, specific patient subgroups) is crucial for effective diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, making robust data augmentation methods like these invaluable for developing reliable medical AI models.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI technique (latent-space, tree-driven diffusion for data augmentation) can significantly enhance the predictive performance and reliability of machine learning models in various health applications. Specifically, it can be applied to improve diagnostic accuracy for rare diseases or conditions by generating synthetic data for underrepresented patient groups, bolster patient risk stratification models by better identifying individuals at risk for uncommon complications, and improve the detection of rare adverse drug reactions or medical events from electronic health records or clinical trial data. The privacy-aware nature of the method is crucial for its deployment in real-world healthcare settings using sensitive patient data.</p>

                    <p>The authors propose latent-space, tree-driven diffusion models for minority oversampling. These models employ conditional flow matching, where gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) learn the vector field for the diffusion process. Data is transformed into a compact latent space using one of three embedding strategies: linear PCA (PCAForest), a learned nonlinear embedding (EmbedForest), or an attention-augmented embedding (AttentionForest). Synthetic data is generated in this latent space and then decoded back to the original feature space. Performance is evaluated on 11 diverse tabular datasets, including healthcare, assessing metrics like minority recall, precision, calibration, distributional similarity, and privacy (using nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record).</p>

                <p>This method has the potential to profoundly impact clinical practice by enabling the development of more accurate and reliable AI models for critical healthcare tasks involving rare events. For instance, it could improve the detection of rare diseases, predict uncommon adverse drug reactions, identify patients at high risk for infrequent but severe complications (e.g., sepsis in specific subgroups), or enhance diagnostic accuracy where data scarcity is an issue. By generating high-fidelity, privacy-aware synthetic data for underrepresented patient groups, it can lead to more robust, equitable, and actionable clinical decision support systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.</p>
