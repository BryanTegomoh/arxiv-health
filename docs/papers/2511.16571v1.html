                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces novel latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods (PCAForest, EmbedForest, AttentionForest) for minority oversampling in severely imbalanced tabular data. By using conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as vector-field learners, these methods significantly improve minority recall, particularly with the AttentionForest variant, while maintaining efficiency, calibration, and privacy. This approach offers a robust solution for high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance, outperforming existing generative oversampling techniques.</p>

                <p>This research is highly relevant for medicine as it provides a robust method to improve the prediction of rare but critical events in healthcare tabular data, such as diagnosing rare diseases, predicting adverse drug reactions, or identifying high-risk patients, which are often minority classes that current models struggle to identify.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI methods developed (latent-space, tree-driven diffusion for data augmentation) can be applied to create more accurate and robust AI models for healthcare. Specifically, they can improve the ability of AI systems to predict or classify rare but critical medical conditions, identify infrequent adverse events, or detect subtle patterns in highly imbalanced tabular patient data. By generating synthetic data that preserves original data structure and privacy, these methods enable better training of machine learning models for tasks like early disease detection, identifying patients at risk for rare complications, or aiding in drug discovery, especially when real-world medical datasets are limited or imbalanced.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.</p>
