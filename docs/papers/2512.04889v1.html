                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces FENCE (Flexible Electric Noise Cancellation Endo-shield), a novel, retrofittable solution designed to suppress electromagnetic interference (EMI) in low-field MRI systems operating without conventional Faraday shields. By blocking capacitive EMI coupling from the body to the RF coil, FENCE, especially when combined with segmented coils, significantly improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduces EMI, thereby enhancing image quality while preserving system portability and accessibility.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a significant challenge for low-field MRI systems operating without conventional Faraday-shielded rooms. Traditional EMI mitigation approaches include external shields, subject grounding via electrodes, or active noise cancellation requiring synchronized receive channels. These methods either limit portability, introduce patient discomfort, or demand expensive hardware. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that EMI primarily couples capacitively from the body to the RF coil. We investigated two methods of blocking capacitive coupling while preserving inductive MRI signal detection: First, we employed capacitive segmentation of the RF coil and studied its effect on EMI coupling. Second, we present FENCE (Flexible Electromagnetic Noise Cancellation Endo-shield), a novel approach blocking capacitive coupling using flexible PCB shields placed inside the RF coil. FENCE can be retrofitted to existing RF coils. Finite element (FE) simulations were used to estimate the expected shielding performance and the impact on RF coil losses prior to practical implementation. Testing in various realistic scenarios then demonstrated that the combination of FENCE with segmented coils is effective against both environmental noise sources and controlled EMI. In phantom experiments, FENCE increased SNR by up to a factor of 9 and reduced EMI levels to near-baseline levels with 9% reduction in coil quality factor (Q factor), showing good agreement with the predictions from the FE simulations. In-vivo head imaging confirmed these results across diverse electromagnetic environments where SNR increased by up to a factor 2 while showing an 18% decrease in Q factor. FENCE's simple design provides a low-cost solution to EMI in low-field MRI, enhancing image quality while maintaining system portability and accessibility.</p>
