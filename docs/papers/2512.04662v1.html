                    <p>The study utilized a laboratory-based spectral μCT system equipped with a small-pixel photon-counting detector operating with two distinct X-ray energy thresholds. Hip acetabular labrum tissue samples from patients with osteoarthritis and femoroacetabular impingement, prepared as intact paraffin-embedded blocks, were imaged.

The method's accuracy was assessed using a calibration phantom, and its findings were validated against conventional histological analysis for calcium spatial distribution and crystal deposition scores.</p>

                    <p>The spectral μCT technique successfully enabled 3D visualization and volumetric quantification of calcified regions within intact fibrocartilage. It achieved a high spatial resolution (20 μm voxel size) for samples up to 3 cm and a low calcium detection threshold (~0.3 g/cm³ for structures down to 50 μm). A quantification accuracy of 5% was established using a calibration phantom. Importantly, the method demonstrated excellent agreement with histology regarding calcium spatial localization and crystal deposition scoring, providing non-destructive, quantitative 3D calcium maps.</p>

                <p>This method could significantly improve the characterization of pathological fibrocartilage calcification in hip joint disorders, offering a more precise and objective assessment than current methods. It has the potential to aid in earlier and more accurate diagnosis, better understanding of disease progression, and development of targeted therapies for conditions like osteoarthritis and femoroacetabular impingement, by providing detailed 3D structural information without tissue destruction.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, it implies the method 'complements histology,' suggesting it may not fully replace it, possibly due to histology's ability to provide cellular-level detail or specific biochemical staining not directly addressed by μCT. The maximum sample size mentioned (~3 cm) could also be a practical limitation for larger tissue structures.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly detailed, the work's conclusion that the technique 'could enhance the characterization' implies future research will focus on broader application and integration into research and clinical workflows for hip joint disorders and other conditions involving fibrocartilage calcification. This could include further validation on diverse patient cohorts, correlation with clinical outcomes, and potential for translation to more widespread use in musculoskeletal pathology assessment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This work introduces a quantitative method for assessing calcification in fibrocartilage using spectral micro-computed tomography ($μ$CT). Tissue samples of hip acetabular labrum from patients with osteoarthritis and femoroacetabular impingement were imaged with a laboratory-based spectral $μ$CT system equipped with a small-pixel photon-counting detector. The detector operated with two energy thresholds, allowing the simultaneous acquisition of two CT datasets at different X-ray energies. A material decomposition algorithm accounting for the system's spectral response was applied to separate calcium- and water-like components, yielding three-dimensional visualization and quantification of calcified regions within intact paraffin-embedded samples. Unlike the conventional method for calcification assessment based on histology, this spectral μCT approach offers volumetric quantification of calcium structures without physical sectioning or staining. The method achieved a voxel size of 20 $μ$m for samples up to ~3 cm, with a calcium detection threshold of ~0.3 g/cm$^3$ for structures down to 50 $μ$m. Quantification accuracy was estimated to be 5% by using a calibration phantom. Further comparison with histology demonstrated the correct localization of calcium spatial distributions and a match in the calcium crystal deposition score by providing non-destructive, quantitative 3D calcium maps of preserved tissue samples. This technique complements histology and could enhance the characterization of pathological fibrocartilage calcification in hip joint disorders.</p>
