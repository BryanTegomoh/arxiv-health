                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper reveals that state-of-the-art generalist Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently outperform specialized clinical AI tools on medical benchmarks, challenging the perception that specialized tools are inherently safer or more reliable. Using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark, generalist models, with GPT-5 leading, demonstrated superior performance compared to OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI, which showed deficits in completeness, communication, context awareness, and safety reasoning.</p>

Specifically, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores across the combined MedQA and HealthBench tasks.

                <p>These findings have a profound clinical impact, suggesting that currently deployed specialized clinical AI tools may be less reliable and potentially less safe than frontier generalist LLMs for tasks like diagnosis and guideline interpretation. This mandates a re-evaluation of current deployment strategies and emphasizes the critical need for rigorous, independent, and transparent validation of all AI systems before their integration into patient-facing clinical workflows to ensure optimal patient outcomes and safety.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Specialized clinical AI assistants are rapidly entering medical practice, often framed as safer or more reliable than general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows.</p>
