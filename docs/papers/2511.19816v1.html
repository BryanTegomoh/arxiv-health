                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the NRC VAD Lexicon v2, a significant expansion of emotion norms providing human-rated Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) scores for over 10,000 English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and an additional 25,000 unigram words. This new, highly reliable resource allows for detailed analysis of the emotional characteristics and compositionality of complex linguistic units, serving as a foundational tool for various research fields.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This lexicon provides a critical computational linguistic tool for quantifying the emotional content of health-related texts, patient communications, and public health campaigns. By assigning VAD scores to both individual words and complex phrases, it enables more precise sentiment analysis and psychological state inference from textual data in medical and health contexts.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This lexicon can be used to build or enhance AI models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in various health applications. For instance, it can power AI systems for: 1) Sentiment analysis and emotion detection in health-related social media, patient forums, or health news to gauge public perception and emotional state. 2) Identifying emotional cues in patient narratives or electronic health records that may indicate distress or specific conditions. 3) Evaluating the emotional impact of health campaigns or warnings. 4) Supporting automated analysis of mental health discourse by providing fine-grained emotional understanding beyond simple sentiment. 5) Understanding the emotional tone of communications related to disease outbreaks or biosecurity events.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology involved collecting human ratings for Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) dimensions across 10,000 English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and increasing the coverage of unigram words, notably including those that have become common since 2018. The reliability of these newly generated VAD associations was rigorously assessed, underpinning the quality and utility of the NRC VAD Lexicon v2. The VAD framework itself is based on established factor analysis studies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences. The NRC VAD Lexicon v2 is freely available through the project webpage: http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html</p>
