                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and calibrated patient-specific, multi-scale computational cardiovascular models for four pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data. By coupling 3D fluid-structure interaction models of pulmonary arteries with 0D heart/Windkessel models, the researchers successfully non-invasively captured patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, with model-derived metrics aligning with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. This approach offers a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</p>
