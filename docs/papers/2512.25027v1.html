                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific computational cardiovascular models for four pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data. The models successfully captured patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over two years, with derived metrics aligning well with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. This work demonstrates the potential of computational modeling as a non-invasive tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for pediatric cardiology and pulmonary medicine, offering a novel approach to non-invasively monitor disease progression and personalize management strategies for pediatric PAH, a severe and often challenging condition. It moves towards predictive tools that could reduce invasive procedures and optimize therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>An 'automated Python-based optimizer' was developed to calibrate model boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</p>
