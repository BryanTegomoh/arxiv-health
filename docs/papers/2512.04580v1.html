                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure designed for the confidential distribution of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with sensitive data. By extending the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors integrates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control, addressing the critical lack of built-in confidentiality in current LLM deployment methods. The solution is validated as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly approach for safeguarding LLM weights, demonstrated through performance benchmarking and compatibility with major inference frameworks.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research is directly relevant to enabling the secure and trustworthy deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various healthcare applications. If LLMs are to be used for tasks such as clinical documentation, patient assistance, medical diagnostics, drug discovery, or personalized medicine, they will inevitably be trained or fine-tuned on sensitive patient data. CryptoTensors provides a foundational security layer for these medical AI applications by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the models themselves during distribution and execution, thereby addressing critical concerns related to patient privacy (e.g., HIPAA compliance) and intellectual property in medical AI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">To enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in various domain-specific applications, sensitive data such as healthcare, law, and finance are being used to privately customize or fine-tune these models. Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.
  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments.</p>
