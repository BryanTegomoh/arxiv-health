                    <p>This paper is a review that conceptually explores and analyzes the integration of AI tools into Horizon Scanning for infectious diseases. It involves examining the potential applications, associated risks, and proposing strategies for implementation and governance, rather than conducting empirical research or experimental studies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Key findings indicate that AI tools offer substantial enhancements across signal detection, data monitoring, scenario analysis, and decision support systems crucial for infectious disease horizon scanning. However, successful AI integration necessitates proactive management of associated risks and the development of robust implementation and governance frameworks. The paper identifies both the considerable potential and the inherent limitations of AI that must be understood for effective public health preparedness.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The potential clinical impact includes earlier and more accurate warning of novel pathogens or outbreaks, enabling faster and more targeted public health interventions. This can lead to improved resource allocation, reduced disease transmission, better patient outcomes through timely clinical responses, and overall enhanced resilience of healthcare systems during infectious disease crises.</p>
