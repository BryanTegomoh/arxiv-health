                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces TARFVAE, a novel generative framework for efficient one-step time series forecasting, combining a Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). TARFVAE overcomes the limitations of existing generative models, which often suffer from laborious recurrent or denoising steps, especially in long-term forecasting, by enabling fast, full-horizon predictions directly from a learned latent space. It achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>TARFVAE integrates a Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) module into a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The TARFLOW component is used to enhance the VAE's posterior estimation by relaxing the typical Gaussian assumption, thus creating a more expressive latent space. For prediction, the model samples from this learned prior latent space, and the VAE decoder then directly generates a full-horizon forecast in a single step. The methodology leverages only the forward pass of TARFLOW to ensure computational efficiency, and notably employs simple MLP modules for feature extraction, challenging the need for more complex time series specific architectures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.</p>
