                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MedROV introduces the first real-time open-vocabulary object detection model for diverse medical imaging, addressing the critical limitation of traditional closed-set detectors in identifying novel pathologies. It achieves this by curating a large multi-modal dataset (Omnis), employing pseudo-labeling for data heterogeneity, and leveraging pre-trained foundation models with contrastive learning. The model effectively detects both known and novel medical structures, setting a new benchmark for speed and accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This innovation is crucial for medical AI as it overcomes the rigidity of closed-set detectors, allowing diagnostic systems to identify a wider range of abnormalities and novel pathologies without requiring extensive retraining for every new condition. This significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in clinical settings, potentially leading to earlier intervention.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>MedROV is an AI model designed for real-time open-vocabulary object detection in diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, histology). This application of AI aims to significantly enhance medical diagnosis by enabling the detection of various anatomical structures, pathologies, or anomalies – including those that the model hasn't been explicitly trained on (novel labels). This capability supports faster and more accurate disease screening, aids in clinical workflows by automatically identifying critical features, and provides a powerful tool for medical research by uncovering new patterns.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Traditional object detection models in medical imaging operate within a closed-set paradigm, limiting their ability to detect objects of novel labels. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection. Our source code, dataset, and trained model are available at https://github.com/toobatehreem/MedROV.</p>
