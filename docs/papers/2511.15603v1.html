                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MaskMed introduces a novel architecture for medical image segmentation, addressing limitations of traditional point-wise convolutional heads by proposing a unified decoupled segmentation head and a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module. This approach separates class-agnostic mask prediction from class label prediction using shared object queries and enables memory-efficient, spatially aligned full-scale feature fusion. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging medical benchmarks, significantly outperforming nnUNet.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>MaskMed introduces two core architectural innovations. First, a **unified decoupled segmentation head** that moves away from conventional channel-wise class prediction. It uses shared object queries to separately predict class-agnostic masks and their corresponding class labels. Second, a **Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module** is integrated. This module leverages deformable attention to allow features from lower-resolution encoder stages to attend to and fuse information from full-resolution encoder features, thereby achieving memory-efficient and spatially coherent information integration across scales.</p>

                <p>The enhanced accuracy and efficiency offered by MaskMed have several practical clinical impacts. It can lead to more precise delineation of organs, tumors, and other anatomical structures, improving the accuracy of disease diagnosis, staging, and progression monitoring. This precision is crucial for highly accurate treatment planning in radiation therapy and surgical procedures, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. The memory-efficient design could also facilitate faster processing times, accelerating clinical workflows and supporting real-time applications where rapid image analysis is critical for patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation typically adopts a point-wise convolutional segmentation head to predict dense labels, where each output channel is heuristically tied to a specific class. This rigid design limits both feature sharing and semantic generalization. In this work, we propose a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries. Furthermore, we introduce a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module that enables low-resolution encoder features to attend across full-resolution encoder features via deformable attention, achieving memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale fusion. Our proposed method, named MaskMed, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV.</p>
