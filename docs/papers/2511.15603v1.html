                <p class="summary-text">MaskMed proposes a novel approach to medical image segmentation by introducing a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates class-agnostic mask prediction from class label prediction using shared object queries. It also features a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module for memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale feature fusion. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming nnUNet on AMOS 2022 and BTCV datasets.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation typically adopts a point-wise convolutional segmentation head to predict dense labels, where each output channel is heuristically tied to a specific class. This rigid design limits both feature sharing and semantic generalization. In this work, we propose a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries. Furthermore, we introduce a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module that enables low-resolution encoder features to attend across full-resolution encoder features via deformable attention, achieving memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale fusion. Our proposed method, named MaskMed, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV.</p>
