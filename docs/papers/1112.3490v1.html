                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents an epidemiological model to investigate the spatial dynamics of airborne infectious disease transmission in indoor environments, focusing on the roles of pathogen-carrying droplets and ambient airflow. It reveals that larger droplets (~4 μm) are significant vectors for disease propagation, while smaller droplets (~0.4 μm) pose a negligible risk. Crucially, the research identifies a threshold air velocity that can impair disease transmission, even when the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is above unity, highlighting the effectiveness of ventilation as an infection control measure.</p>

                    <p>The authors developed an epidemiological model to simulate the spatial dynamics of airborne infectious disease transmission. This model explicitly incorporates the physical processes of droplet transport, namely diffusion and convection, and integrates the effect of ambient airflow. The incorporation of airflow led to the formulation of a delay equation, where the density of pathogen-carrying droplets at any given time depends on the infectious density at an earlier time.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found that small droplets (~0.4 μm) are largely inconsequential for infection due to low viral loads and prolonged transmission times. In contrast, larger droplets (~4 μm) are significant, capable of driving infectious waves. Droplet diffusion alone is an inefficient transport mechanism for spatial spread. Most importantly, the research derived a threshold air velocity that, if surpassed, can effectively impair disease transmission even in situations where the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) indicates an epidemic.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings have direct clinical and public health implications, suggesting that ventilation strategies targeting the removal or dispersion of larger droplets through optimized ambient airflow can be highly effective in preventing airborne disease outbreaks in indoor settings. This provides a quantifiable basis for establishing air exchange rate recommendations and designing engineering controls in hospitals, clinics, and other high-occupancy environments to enhance patient and staff safety against airborne pathogens.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Disease outbreaks, such as those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 and the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza, have highlighted the potential for airborne transmission in indoor environments. Respirable pathogen-carrying droplets provide a vector for the spatial spread of infection with droplet transport determined by diffusive and convective processes. An epidemiological model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets ($\sim 0.4\ μ$m) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets ($\sim 4\ μ$m) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localised susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ exceeds unity.</p>
