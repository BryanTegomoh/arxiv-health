                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">PLGC introduces a self-supervised graph condensation method that addresses the computational cost of training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large, potentially noisy datasets by generating small synthetic graphs. Unlike existing approaches, PLGC operates without ground-truth labels, constructing latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings to optimize condensed graphs that preserve the original graph's structural and feature statistics. It achieves competitive performance on clean data and demonstrates substantial robustness, often outperforming supervised baselines under label noise and distribution shift.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Many medical datasets, such as patient similarity networks, drug interaction graphs, disease progression models, and electronic health records (EHRs), are vast, complex, and inherently noisy or sparsely labeled. PLGC offers a robust method to efficiently analyze these large graphs using GNNs, enabling more reliable insights and predictions despite common data quality challenges in healthcare.</p>

                <p>This research would enable more robust and efficient training of GNN models for tasks such as identifying novel drug candidates by analyzing molecular graphs, predicting disease progression based on patient networks from electronic health records, analyzing complex gene regulatory pathways from genomic data, or classifying protein functions from interaction networks. Its 'label-free' and 'robust to noise' properties are particularly valuable in medical research where high-quality labeled datasets are often limited, expensive to generate, or inherently noisy.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>PLGC is a self-supervised framework that first learns node embeddings from the original large graph. From these embeddings, it constructs latent pseudo-labels, which are used to jointly learn latent prototypes and node assignments. The core optimization process then generates a smaller, synthetic condensed graph that matches the structural and feature statistics of the original graph, guided by these pseudo-labels, entirely without requiring any ground-truth labels. Theoretical analyses support the pseudo-labeling strategy and embedding alignment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.</p>
