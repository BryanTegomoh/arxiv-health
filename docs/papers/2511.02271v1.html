                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces HTSC-CIF, a novel framework designed to address three critical challenges in Medical Report Generation (MRG) – insufficient domain knowledge, poor text-visual alignment, and spurious correlations – through a hierarchical task decomposition and cross-modal causal intervention. The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRG methods by enhancing visual encoders, boosting cross-modal alignment, and reducing confounders for more reliable lesion descriptions from radiological images.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.</p>
