                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB) to rigorously evaluate methods for assessing the reliability of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in high-stakes domains, including clinical reasoning. The study reveals a fundamental trade-off between a confidence estimator's ability to discriminate between correct/incorrect answers (AUROC) and its calibration (ECE), with no single current representation-based method excelling at both. It further demonstrates that increasing architectural complexity does not consistently improve performance over simpler baselines, suggesting limitations in current approaches.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study introduced the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a large-scale dataset of 347,496 reasoning traces collected from six diverse Large Reasoning Models. These traces were generated across a suite of datasets from high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, mathematical, and general reasoning, with all samples meticulously annotated for correctness. Using RMCB, the researchers conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based confidence estimation methods, which included sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectural approaches, assessing their performance based on discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE) metrics.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings reveal a persistent and critical trade-off between a confidence estimator's ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect LRM outputs (AUROC) and its ability to accurately reflect the true probability of correctness (ECE). Specifically, text-based encoders achieved the best discrimination (AUROC of 0.672), while structurally-aware models demonstrated superior calibration (ECE of 0.148), with no single method achieving state-of-the-art in both. Furthermore, the research indicates that merely increasing the architectural complexity of confidence estimators does not reliably lead to improved performance over simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods that rely solely on chunk-level hidden states within the reasoning process.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>For the deployment of LRMs in high-stakes clinical settings (e.g., assisting with diagnoses, suggesting treatment plans), the inability of current confidence estimators to simultaneously achieve high discrimination and calibration presents a serious challenge. Clinicians cannot reliably trust an LRM's stated confidence as an accurate indicator of its output's correctness. This necessitates the development of novel confidence estimation techniques that overcome this trade-off, or careful risk mitigation strategies, before LRMs can be safely and effectively integrated into clinical decision-making workflows, highlighting the need for cautious optimism and further foundational research in medical AI.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The study explicitly demonstrates the 'limitations of current representation-based paradigms' for confidence estimation. It points to a performance ceiling for methods that rely solely on chunk-level hidden states for estimating confidence, implying that current approaches may be inherently constrained in their ability to jointly optimize discrimination and calibration for complex, multi-step reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly outlined as future directions, the findings strongly imply a critical need to explore novel confidence estimation paradigms beyond current representation-based methods and chunk-level hidden states. Future research should focus on developing techniques that can overcome the observed trade-off between discrimination and calibration, potentially by incorporating richer forms of reasoning trace analysis, causality, or uncertainty quantification methods, to enhance the reliability of LRMs in high-stakes domains like medicine.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The miscalibration of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, necessitating methods to accurately estimate the confidence of their long-form, multi-step outputs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures. Our central finding is a persistent trade-off between discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE): text-based encoders achieve the best AUROC (0.672), while structurally-aware models yield the best ECE (0.148), with no single method dominating both. Furthermore, we find that increased architectural complexity does not reliably outperform simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods relying solely on chunk-level hidden states. This work provides the most comprehensive benchmark for this task to date, establishing rigorous baselines and demonstrating the limitations of current representation-based paradigms.</p>
