                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">SparseST is a novel framework designed to address the high computational cost of state-of-the-art ConvLSTM models in spatiotemporal data mining, particularly for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. It achieves efficiency by pioneering the exploitation of data sparsity and feature redundancy, which existing efficient AI methods overlook, while also providing a multi-objective composite loss function to balance model performance and computational cost. This approach offers a practical guide for adapting models to specific computational resource constraints and performance requirements.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.</p>
