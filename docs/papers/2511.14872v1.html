                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the relationship between neuronal avalanche criticality and thermodynamic signatures in Maximum Entropy (ME) models, finding that ME models can distinguish subcritical brain states from critical/supercritical ones. However, thermodynamic signatures of criticality derived from ME models are indistinguishable between critical and supercritical conditions, despite significant differences in underlying neuronal dynamics and functional performance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding the precise interpretation of Maximum Entropy models is crucial for their application in diagnosing and characterizing brain disorders, as both neuronal avalanche deviations and ME model analysis are used to assess brain states, and misinterpreting criticality could lead to inaccurate pathological classifications.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research employs an interpretable neural network model to validate findings about neuronal criticality and its deviation. This represents an application of AI/computational modeling to understand fundamental brain dynamics that are 'linked to brain disorders.' Such models could eventually contribute to AI-powered diagnostic tools for identifying pathological brain states, monitoring disease progression, or evaluating treatment efficacy in neurological or psychiatric conditions, by classifying brain activity as critical, subcritical, or supercritical.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized organotypic rat cortex slice cultures, which were maintained under physiological conditions or induced into hypo- or hyper-excitable states using drugs.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Maximum Entropy models inferred from critical rat cortex cultures exhibited clear thermodynamic signatures of criticality. Crucially, ME models from supercritical cultures also showed equally strong thermodynamic criticality signatures, despite these cultures having altered dynamics and poor functional performance. Conversely, ME models from subcritical cultures did not show any thermodynamic indicators of criticality. This indicates that while ME models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality based on thermodynamic signatures alone.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research highlights a significant caveat for the clinical application of maximum entropy models in assessing brain criticality. While these models can identify subcritical states, they may provide misleadingly 'critical' thermodynamic signatures for pathological supercritical states. This necessitates careful interpretation and potentially multi-modal diagnostic approaches when using ME models to infer brain states in neurological or psychiatric disorders, ensuring that true functional criticality is accurately distinguished from dysfunctional supercriticality.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Empirical evidence of scaling behaviors in neuronal avalanches suggests that neuronal populations in the brain operate near criticality. Departure from scaling in neuronal avalanches has been used as a measure of distance to criticality and linked to brain disorders. A distinct line of evidence for brain criticality has come from thermodynamic signatures in maximum entropy (ME) models. Both of these approaches have been widely applied to the analysis of neuronal data. However, the relationship between deviations from avalanche criticality and thermodynamics of ME models of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. To address this question, we study spontaneous activity of organotypic rat cortex slice cultures in physiological and drug-induced hypo- or hyper-excitable conditions, which are classified as critical, subcritical and supercritical based on avalanche dynamics. We find that ME models inferred from critical cultures show signatures of criticality in thermodynamic quantities, e.g. specific heat. However, such signatures are also present, and equally strong, in models inferred from supercritical cultures -- despite their altered dynamics and poor functional performance. On the contrary, ME models inferred from subcritical cultures do not show thermodynamic hints of criticality. Importantly, we confirm these results using an interpretable neural network model that can be tuned to and away from avalanche criticality. Our findings indicate that maximum entropy models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems. However, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality, although they may still capture a number of important features from neuronal data.</p>
