                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a deep learning framework that utilizes fine-tuned ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model, to predict the pIC50 values of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) directly from SMILES strings. Leveraging a large, imbalanced dataset and advanced pre-training strategies, the developed model significantly outperforms classical baselines and demonstrates competitive performance with Random Forest for identifying potential TDP1 inhibitors. This robust, 3D-structure-free tool aims to accelerate early drug discovery for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized deep learning with fine-tuned ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model, for quantitative regression of pIC50 values. Input features were Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings, eliminating the need for 3D molecular structures. The model was trained on a large consensus dataset of 177,092 compounds. To handle severe activity imbalance (2.1% active), stratified data splits and sample weighting were employed. Two pre-training strategies, Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Token Regression (MTR), were systematically evaluated. Model performance was assessed against classical baselines (Random Predictor) and Random Forest using metrics like regression accuracy, enrichment factor (EF@1%), and precision (Precision@1%).</p>

                <p class="abstract">Predicting the inhibitory potency of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1)-a key target in overcoming cancer chemoresistance-remains a critical challenge in early drug discovery. We present a deep learning framework for the quantitative regression of pIC50 values from molecular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using fine-tuned variants of ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model. Leveraging a large-scale consensus dataset of 177,092 compounds, we systematically evaluate two pre-training strategies-Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Token Regression (MTR)-under stratified data splits and sample weighting to address severe activity imbalance which only 2.1% are active. Our approach outperforms classical baselines Random Predictor in both regression accuracy and virtual screening utility, and has competitive performance compared to Random Forest, achieving high enrichment factor EF@1% 17.4 and precision Precision@1% 37.4 among top-ranked predictions. The resulting model, validated through rigorous ablation and hyperparameter studies, provides a robust, ready-to-deploy tool for prioritizing TDP1 inhibitors for experimental testing. By enabling accurate, 3D-structure-free pIC50 prediction directly from SMILES, this work demonstrates the transformative potential of chemical transformers in accelerating target-specific drug discovery.</p>
