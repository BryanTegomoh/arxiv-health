                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a deep learning framework utilizing fine-tuned ChemBERTa models to accurately predict the pIC50 values of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) directly from their SMILES strings. Addressing the challenge of cancer chemoresistance, the approach leverages a large, imbalanced dataset and systematically evaluates pre-training strategies, outperforming classical baselines and demonstrating competitive virtual screening utility. The resulting model offers a robust, 3D-structure-free tool to accelerate the discovery of TDP1 inhibitors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Predicting the inhibitory potency of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1)-a key target in overcoming cancer chemoresistance-remains a critical challenge in early drug discovery. We present a deep learning framework for the quantitative regression of pIC50 values from molecular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using fine-tuned variants of ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model. Leveraging a large-scale consensus dataset of 177,092 compounds, we systematically evaluate two pre-training strategies-Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Token Regression (MTR)-under stratified data splits and sample weighting to address severe activity imbalance which only 2.1% are active. Our approach outperforms classical baselines Random Predictor in both regression accuracy and virtual screening utility, and has competitive performance compared to Random Forest, achieving high enrichment factor EF@1% 17.4 and precision Precision@1% 37.4 among top-ranked predictions. The resulting model, validated through rigorous ablation and hyperparameter studies, provides a robust, ready-to-deploy tool for prioritizing TDP1 inhibitors for experimental testing. By enabling accurate, 3D-structure-free pIC50 prediction directly from SMILES, this work demonstrates the transformative potential of chemical transformers in accelerating target-specific drug discovery.</p>
