                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper independently re-evaluates the zero-shot generalization claims of deep learning (DL) methods in the LUMIR challenge for deformable image registration. While DL methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1-weighted MRI, their performance significantly degrades on out-of-distribution contrasts and high-resolution data, challenging previous assertions of universal zero-shot superiority due to domain shift and scalability limitations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The observed significant performance degradation of deep learning methods on out-of-distribution MRI contrasts poses a substantial risk in clinical applications where accurate registration across different sequences is essential (e.g., tumor tracking, surgical planning, multi-modal image analysis). Scalability issues on high-resolution data limit their utility for detailed anatomical or pathological assessment, and sensitivity to preprocessing introduces variability, potentially reducing trust and reliability in clinical deployment. These findings suggest that current deep learning registration solutions may require extensive, contrast-specific fine-tuning or robust domain adaptation strategies before widespread clinical application, especially for diverse patient populations and imaging protocols.</p>

                <p>The paper highlights inherent limitations of deep learning methods in the context of deformable registration: their scalability limitations on high-resolution data and high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. It also implicitly critiques the original LUMIR challenge for potentially not setting evaluation conditions that adequately reflect practical clinical workflows or account for domain shift, thus inadvertently favoring certain method classes and potentially overstating zero-shot capabilities.</p>

This suggests a future direction for creating robust, clinically relevant benchmarks for deformable image registration that rigorously test generalization across diverse contrasts, resolutions, and patient populations, rather than relying on conditions that may inadvertently favor specific method classes or overestimate their zero-shot capabilities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.</p>
