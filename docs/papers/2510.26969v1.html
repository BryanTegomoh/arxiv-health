                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Underreporting of critical health issues like gender-based violence significantly compromises public health efforts, resource allocation, and patient safety. This methodology provides a data-driven, systematic approach to uncover these hidden incidents, thereby improving health surveillance, informing policy, and enabling targeted interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.</p>
