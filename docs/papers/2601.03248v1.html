                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical but underdeveloped field of spatio-temporal reasoning in time series, crucial for high-stakes decision-making in domains like disease propagation, by introducing ST-Bench, a novel benchmark, and STReasoner, an LLM-powered framework. STReasoner effectively integrates time series, graph structures, and text for explicit reasoning, achieving substantial accuracy gains (17-135%) at a fraction of the cost of proprietary models while generalizing robustly to real-world data.</p>

                <p>This research could significantly enhance early warning systems for disease outbreaks by accurately identifying spatio-temporal patterns and correlations. It could aid in dynamic resource allocation (e.g., medical supplies, personnel) during pandemics or regional health crises, and improve the precision of epidemiological modeling for more effective public health policy decisions. For instance, predicting the spread of infectious diseases from urban centers to rural areas based on mobility patterns and environmental factors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p>
