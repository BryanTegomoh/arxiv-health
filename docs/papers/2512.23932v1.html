                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces McCoy, a novel proof-of-concept framework that addresses the challenge of creating high-quality knowledge bases for symbolic AI in healthcare by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP). McCoy leverages LLMs to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and uses an ASP solver to produce robust and interpretable disease diagnoses. Preliminary results indicate strong performance on small-scale diagnostic tasks, demonstrating the potential for explainable AI in medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The McCoy framework employs an orchestration strategy where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to translate unstructured medical literature into formal Answer Set Programming (ASP) code, representing medical knowledge. This generated ASP code is then combined with patient-specific clinical data. An ASP solver subsequently processes this integrated knowledge base to logically infer and arrive at a final disease diagnosis.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is that the McCoy framework, a novel integration of LLMs and ASP, successfully operates as a proof-of-concept for explainable disease diagnosis. It exhibits strong performance on small-scale diagnostic tasks, demonstrating its capability to leverage medical literature and patient data to produce interpretable predictions.</p>

                <p>This framework has the potential to significantly improve clinical decision-making by providing highly accurate and, crucially, *explainable* disease diagnoses. This transparency can foster greater trust among clinicians in AI-driven diagnostic tools, reduce diagnostic errors, and streamline the process of building and maintaining medical knowledge bases, ultimately leading to more effective and personalized patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.</p>
