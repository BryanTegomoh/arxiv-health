                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology revolves around the Cross-Fidelity Knowledge Distillation and Adaptive Fusion Network (CFKD-AFN). It leverages two types of data: abundant low-fidelity simulation data and scarce high-fidelity trial data. The CFKD-AFN comprises a dual-channel knowledge distillation module, which extracts diverse and complementary knowledge from a model trained on the low-fidelity data, acting as a 'teacher.' This distilled knowledge is then used to enhance a 'student' model trained on the scarce high-fidelity data. An attention-guided fusion module dynamically integrates information from both the high-fidelity data and the distilled knowledge channels, allowing for optimized multi-source information processing. The approach aims to transfer robust patterns from readily available (though less precise) data to improve predictions on precise but limited data.</p>

The network demonstrated strong robustness across varying high-fidelity dataset sizes, crucial for real-world scarce data scenarios. Additionally, an interpretable variant of CFKD-AFN was developed, allowing for the exploration of latent medical semantics, which can provide valuable insights for clinicians.</p>

This can lead to improved patient stratification, optimized treatment plans, and better-informed clinical decision-making. The interpretability feature further enhances its clinical utility by providing insights into the prediction rationale, fostering trust among clinicians and facilitating its integration into routine practice for conditions like COPD and other rare diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.</p>
