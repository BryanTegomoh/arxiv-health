                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Cross-Fidelity Knowledge Distillation and Adaptive Fusion Network (CFKD-AFN) to improve personalized treatment outcome prediction, particularly for small-sample and rare patient groups. CFKD-AFN addresses the scarcity of high-fidelity trial data by leveraging abundant low-fidelity simulation data through a dual-channel knowledge distillation and attention-guided fusion approach. The method demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness, exemplified in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The CFKD-AFN framework is designed to integrate information from disparate data sources: scarce high-fidelity trial data and abundant low-fidelity simulation data. It employs a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract and transfer complementary knowledge from a model trained on the low-fidelity data to enhance the learning process for the high-fidelity data. An attention-guided fusion module then dynamically combines the features and insights derived from both data fidelities and distillation channels to produce robust personalized treatment outcome predictions. The method was validated using a dataset for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment outcome prediction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.</p>
