                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The CFKD-AFN framework utilizes a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract distinct, complementary knowledge representations from a low-fidelity model (trained on large simulation datasets). This distilled knowledge is then adaptively integrated with information derived directly from scarce high-fidelity clinical trial data via an attention-guided fusion module. This fusion dynamically weighs the importance of the two information sources, allowing the network to make robust predictions despite data scarcity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.</p>
