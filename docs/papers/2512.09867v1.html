                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved creating MedForget, a hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning testbed based on hospital data organized into a nested structure (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section). It contains 3840 multimodal instances (image, question, answer) with dedicated unlearning targets for each of its eight hierarchical levels. Four state-of-the-art unlearning methods were evaluated on three distinct AI tasks (generation, classification, cloze). A novel reconstruction attack was also devised, progressively adding hierarchical context to prompts, to assess the completeness and robustness of unlearning.</p>

                    <p>Existing state-of-the-art unlearning methods are currently insufficient, as they fail to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without compromising the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness of unlearning is highly dependent on granularity; fine-grained unlearning leaves models susceptible to reconstruction attacks that leverage hierarchical context, indicating that critical information pathways are not fully erased.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.</p>
