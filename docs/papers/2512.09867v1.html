                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">MedForget is a novel hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning testbed designed to address critical privacy and compliance challenges, such as the "right to be forgotten," in medical AI systems. It models hospital data hierarchically and uses multimodal instances with specific unlearning targets, revealing that current state-of-the-art unlearning methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without compromising diagnostic performance. Furthermore, it demonstrates that fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, while coarse-grained unlearning offers more resistance.</p>

                    <p>MedForget is a testbed that models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section) across eight levels. It includes a benchmark of 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances with explicit retain and forget data splits, and rephrased variants for robust evaluation. The study evaluates four state-of-the-art unlearning methods across three tasks: generation, classification, and cloze.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Existing state-of-the-art unlearning methods face significant challenges in achieving complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting in medical AI without concurrently degrading diagnostic performance on retained data. The effectiveness of unlearning is highly dependent on its granularity: models unlearned at a coarse hierarchical level exhibit strong resistance to reconstruction attacks, suggesting better overall forgetting. Conversely, models subjected to fine-grained unlearning are shown to remain vulnerable to such reconstruction attacks, indicating that specific, detailed hierarchical information may not be fully erased.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>MedForget directly contributes to the creation of more trustworthy and legally compliant medical AI systems. By highlighting the limitations of current unlearning techniques and providing a rigorous testing environment, it guides researchers and developers towards building AI models that can genuinely forget sensitive patient data when required, fulfilling regulatory mandates like HIPAA and GDPR. This will enable broader and safer adoption of MLLMs in clinical settings, ensuring patient privacy without sacrificing diagnostic utility.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the limitations of *existing SOTA unlearning methods*, rather than MedForget itself. Specifically, current methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without performance reduction. Furthermore, fine-grained unlearning at present leaves models vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, indicating insufficient data removal at detailed hierarchical levels.</p>

This includes creating novel algorithms that can achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without compromising diagnostic performance, particularly addressing the vulnerability of fine-grained unlearning to reconstruction attacks, to build truly compliant medical AI systems.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.</p>
