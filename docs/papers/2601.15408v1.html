                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>CURE employs an error-aware curriculum learning strategy to fine-tune a pre-existing multimodal instructional model. The training process leverages public datasets and is structured around three interconnected tasks: phrase grounding (linking textual findings to specific image regions), grounded report generation (generating reports with explicit visual evidence), and anatomy-grounded report generation (ensuring findings are correctly localized to anatomical structures). A key aspect is the dynamic adjustment of training sample selection, where samples that the model struggles with (harder samples) are prioritized based on its performance, aiming to improve spatial and textual alignment.</p>

                    <p>The CURE framework demonstrates significant improvements across key metrics: grounding accuracy improved by +0.37 IoU (Intersection over Union), overall report quality increased by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and the rate of factual hallucinations in generated reports was reduced by 18.6%. These enhancements highlight CURE's ability to produce more reliable and well-grounded medical reports efficiently, without requiring additional data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical vision-language models can automate the generation of radiology reports but struggle with accurate visual grounding and factual consistency. Existing models often misalign textual findings with visual evidence, leading to unreliable or weakly grounded predictions. We present CURE, an error-aware curriculum learning framework that improves grounding and report quality without any additional data. CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%. CURE is a data-efficient framework that enhances both grounding accuracy and report reliability.
