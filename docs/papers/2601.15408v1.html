                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Problem Addressed**: Existing medical vision-language models for radiology report generation often suffer from poor visual grounding (misaligning text with images) and factual inconsistencies (hallucinations), leading to unreliable reports.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Proposed Solution (CURE)**: CURE (Curriculum-guided Multi-task Training for Reliable Anatomy Grounded Report Generation) is an error-aware curriculum learning framework designed to enhance grounding and report quality.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Methodology**: It fine-tunes a pre-existing multimodal instructional model on three specific tasks: phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Dynamic Curriculum Learning**: CURE employs a dynamic sampling strategy that adjusts based on the model's performance, prioritizing harder samples to improve both spatial and textual alignment between images and generated text.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Significant Grounding Improvement**: The framework achieves a notable improvement in grounding accuracy, demonstrated by a +0.37 IoU (Intersection over Union) score.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Enhanced Report Quality & Reliability**: CURE boosts overall report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore and, critically, reduces factual hallucinations by 18.6%, leading to more reliable clinical outputs.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Data Efficiency**: The approach is highlighted as data-efficient, improving performance without requiring the collection or annotation of new training data.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Open-Source Availability**: Code and model weights are publicly available, promoting reproducibility and further research.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>CURE employs an error-aware curriculum learning framework to fine-tune a pre-existing multimodal instructional model. It utilizes a multi-task training approach, simultaneously optimizing for phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation on public datasets. The core of its curriculum learning involves dynamically adjusting the sampling of training data, emphasizing harder or more error-prone samples based on the model's real-time performance to enhance spatial and textual alignment.</p>

It also boosts the quality of generated radiology reports, as measured by a +0.188 CXRFEScore, and substantially reduces factual hallucinations by 18.6%. These improvements are achieved without the need for additional data, highlighting the framework's data efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By enhancing the accuracy of visual grounding and drastically reducing hallucinations, CURE can lead to more reliable and trustworthy AI-generated radiology reports. This directly translates to improved diagnostic confidence for clinicians, potentially faster report turnaround times, and a reduced risk of misdiagnosis due to AI errors. This advancement could support radiologists by pre-populating reports with higher fidelity, allowing them to focus on critical analysis and patient-specific nuances, thereby improving overall patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical vision-language models can automate the generation of radiology reports but struggle with accurate visual grounding and factual consistency. Existing models often misalign textual findings with visual evidence, leading to unreliable or weakly grounded predictions. We present CURE, an error-aware curriculum learning framework that improves grounding and report quality without any additional data. CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%. CURE is a data-efficient framework that enhances both grounding accuracy and report reliability.
