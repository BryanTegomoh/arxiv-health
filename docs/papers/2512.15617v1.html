                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper argues for a robust safety evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) used in safety-critical roles, particularly when LLMs act as judges (LaJ). It proposes that safety can be enhanced by moving beyond performative claims and instead focusing on evidence derived from a basket of weighted evaluation metrics, context-sensitive error severity, and confidence thresholds for human review. The core aim is to make LLMs safe and reliable for integration into critical information flows previously handled by humans, especially in healthcare.</p>

                    <p>The paper presents a conceptual and argumentative methodology, proposing a theoretical framework for LLM safety evaluation rather than reporting experimental results. It advocates for an evidence-based approach by suggesting the design of a 'basket of weighted metrics,' the use of context sensitivity to define error severity, and the implementation of confidence thresholds to mandate human review for critical judgments when LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) concordance is low.</p>

                    <p>The paper's key findings are its central arguments and proposed solutions: safety in LLM deployments, especially LaJ, must prioritize empirical evidence from evaluation; a multi-faceted approach involving a 'basket of weighted metrics' is crucial due to the non-deterministic nature of NLP tasks; error severity must be context-sensitive; and human review, triggered by confidence thresholds and low LaJ concordance, is essential for mitigating risk in critical decision points.</p>

                <p>This framework could significantly enhance the reliability and safety of AI systems in clinical settings by providing a structured, auditable approach to evaluate and manage LLM-associated risks. It enables safer integration of LLMs for tasks like initial patient triage or interpreting medical documentation, potentially reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through systematic human oversight and robust validation of AI judgments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.</p>
