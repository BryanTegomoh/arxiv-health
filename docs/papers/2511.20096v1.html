                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical issue of missed detections in early forest fire warnings due to a lack of suitable datasets and models. The authors propose a novel dataset for early identification of smoke plumes and initial fire instances, synthesized using game simulators like Red Dead Redemption 2 and combined with existing images. They then evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models, specifically YOLOv7 and different detection transformers, for image classification and localization on this newly compiled dataset to improve early warning systems.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Early detection and containment of forest fires significantly reduce the public health burden associated with large-scale blazes, including smoke inhalation (respiratory illnesses), severe burns, heatstroke, mental health trauma from displacement, and strain on emergency medical services. Faster response translates directly to fewer health emergencies and improved community well-being.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involves two main components: 1) Dataset creation: A novel dataset was compiled for early fire detection, featuring smoke plumes and initial fire instances. This dataset was synthetically generated using game simulators (Red Dead Redemption 2) and augmented with existing real-world fire images. 2) Model comparison: State-of-the-art object detection and localization models, specifically YOLOv7 and different variants of Detection Transformers, were applied and compared on this proposed dataset.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary findings detailed in the abstract are the successful creation of a novel, comprehensive dataset tailored for early forest fire detection, emphasizing initial smoke and small fires. This dataset addresses the critical gap in existing resources. Furthermore, the paper establishes a comparative analysis framework by applying and testing advanced deep learning models (YOLOv7 and Detection Transformers) on this new dataset to benchmark their performance for classification and localization of early fire indicators.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By enabling earlier detection and thus faster containment of forest fires, this research has the potential to dramatically reduce the incidence and severity of smoke-related respiratory illnesses (e.g., asthma exacerbations, COPD flare-ups), direct burn injuries, and heat-related emergencies. It can also mitigate the psychological trauma experienced by individuals and communities affected by large fires and reduce the strain on healthcare systems during such environmental disasters.</p>

                <p>The abstract explicitly notes the limitation of existing methods, stating they "suffer from missed detection" due to "lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task." While the paper aims to address this, the abstract itself does not detail the specific performance metrics or comparative advantages of the tested models, nor does it discuss potential limitations of using synthetically generated data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">There have been many recent developments in the use of Deep Learning Neural Networks for fire detection. In this paper, we explore an early warning system for detection of forest fires. Due to the lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task, existing methods suffer from missed detection. In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire. We obtained this dataset synthetically by utilising game simulators such as Red Dead Redemption 2. We also combined our dataset with already published images to obtain a more comprehensive set. Finally, we compared image classification and localisation methods on the proposed dataset. More specifically we used YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) and different models of detection transformer.</p>
