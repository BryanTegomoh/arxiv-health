                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research addresses the critical challenge of glioma segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa, where limited MRI infrastructure and diverse acquisition protocols lead to significant domain shift. The authors propose SegFormer3D-plus, a novel radiomics-guided transformer architecture designed for robust segmentation under such domain variability. Their method, which incorporates intensity harmonization, domain-aware sampling, and advanced encoder design, demonstrates improved tumor subregion delineation and boundary localization on heterogeneous African clinical scans, highlighting the efficacy of domain adaptation in resource-limited settings.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate glioma segmentation is fundamental for diagnosis, treatment planning (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy), and prognosis evaluation in neuro-oncology. This paper's advancements are crucial for improving patient care in Sub-Saharan Africa, where current challenges severely hinder effective clinical decision-making due to inconsistent medical imaging data.</p>
