                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">FINDER is a novel framework designed for robust classification in 'noisy' or 'data-deficient' datasets by integrating fundamental stochastic analysis into feature learning and inference. It constructs "stochastic features" by mapping empirical data to Hilbert spaces, employing the Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion and eigen-decomposition to identify distinct class regions. The method has achieved state-of-the-art breakthroughs in challenging domains, including Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and remote sensing for deforestation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.</p>
