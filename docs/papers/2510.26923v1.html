                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL), a dynamic training strategy for deep learning models. SACL incorporates adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization. This strategy was implemented with YOLOv11 as the base detector and evaluated on the LUNA25 dataset. Performance was assessed, specifically measuring mAP50, under various simulated data scarcity conditions (10%, 20%, and 50% of the full training data) compared to a baseline and static curriculum learning.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>SACL achieved performance on par with static curriculum learning on the full LUNA25 dataset (in mAP50). However, its primary advantage was demonstrated in data-limited scenarios, where it yielded significant mAP50 improvements over the baseline: 4.6% at 10% data, 3.5% at 20% data, and 2.0% at 50% data. This indicates SACL's superior robustness and efficiency when annotation resources are scarce.</p>

                <p>SACL provides a crucial practical solution for healthcare institutions facing limitations in annotated data, allowing them to develop and deploy effective lung nodule detection systems using deep learning. By enabling robust model training without demanding extensive manual annotations or architectural changes, it can accelerate the integration of AI for early lung cancer diagnosis, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes in resource-constrained clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.</p>
