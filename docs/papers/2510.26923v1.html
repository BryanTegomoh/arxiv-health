                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL), a novel training strategy designed to overcome challenges in deep learning-based lung nodule detection when annotated data is scarce. SACL dynamically adjusts its curriculum based on available data scale, demonstrating significant performance improvements (up to 4.6% mAP50) over baseline methods in data-limited scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance on full datasets without architectural modifications.</p>

                    <p>The authors propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL), a training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design. It integrates adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization. This strategy was implemented with YOLOv11 as the base detector and evaluated on the LUNA25 dataset. Performance was quantified using mean Average Precision at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 (mAP50), comparing SACL against a baseline and static curriculum learning across various proportions of the training data (10%, 20%, 50%, and full dataset).</p>

                    <p>SACL demonstrated comparable mAP50 performance to static curriculum learning on the full LUNA25 dataset. Crucially, under data-limited conditions, SACL significantly outperformed the baseline, achieving 4.6% mAP50 improvement with only 10% of the training data, 3.5% improvement with 20% data, and 2.0% improvement with 50% of the training data.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research directly addresses a significant bottleneck in the clinical adoption of AI: the scarcity of large, expertly annotated medical datasets. By providing a data-efficient training strategy, SACL empowers healthcare institutions to develop and deploy high-performing lung nodule detection systems using their existing, often limited, annotation resources. This has the potential to accelerate the integration of AI into radiology workflows, leading to earlier and more accurate lung cancer diagnoses, even in resource-constrained clinical environments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.</p>
