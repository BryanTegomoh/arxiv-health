                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study employs a predator-prey mathematical framework to model Aedes mosquito-dengue virus interactions, identifying vector competence (vc) as a critical driver of disease persistence. It demonstrates that while endemic conditions are globally stable, the vector's innate immune system is overwhelmed by high vc in tropical/subtropical environments, revealing an evolutionary trade-off that limits immune enhancement and drives transmission instability.</p>

                    <p>Endemic dengue conditions naturally arise from vector-pathogen interactions and are globally stable. However, under the high pathogen pressure characteristic of tropical/subtropical settings, the high vector competence (vc) of Aedes mosquitoes overwhelms their innate immune systems. This reveals a fundamental biological trade-off where vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot comparably enhance immune capacity, ultimately driving instability in disease transmission dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million
people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent
research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and
vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors
and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector
infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we
show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay
between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global
stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and
subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot
offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological
trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot
enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their
evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in
disease transmission dynamics.</p>
