                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found that vector competence (vc) is a key driver of within-vector infection dynamics and endemic dengue persistence. Endemic conditions emerge naturally from vector-pathogen interactions and exhibit global stability. Critically, under tropical/subtropical conditions, the vector's innate immune system cannot offset high vc during outbreaks, revealing a biological trade-off: vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but not enhanced immune capacity. This constraint limits evolutionary responses and drives instability in transmission dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By elucidating the fundamental biological trade-offs and mechanisms governing dengue persistence and instability, this research offers critical insights for designing more targeted and effective vector control strategies. Understanding the limits of vector immune evolution suggests that interventions focused on modulating vector competence or disrupting this specific trade-off could be more impactful than broad-spectrum approaches, potentially leading to more stable disease control and reduced endemic outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million
people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent
research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and
vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors
and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector
infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we
show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay
between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global
stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and
subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot
offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological
trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot
enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their
evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in
disease transmission dynamics.</p>
