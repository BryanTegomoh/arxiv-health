                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study employs a predator-prey mathematical framework to model the interactions between Aedes vectors and dengue pathogens, demonstrating how vector competence (vc) drives endemic disease persistence. It reveals a fundamental biological trade-off where vectors, particularly under tropical pressures, cannot enhance their immune capacity to offset high transmission potential, leading to instability in dengue transmission dynamics. The research also proves the global stability of these endemic conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Endemic conditions for dengue naturally arise from the biological interplay between vectors and pathogens, and these conditions are globally stable. A key discovery is that under tropical environments, the vector's innate immune system cannot overcome the high vector competence during outbreaks. This reveals a fundamental biological trade-off: vectors can evolve for higher transmission but not for stronger immunity, which limits their evolutionary response to pathogens and causes instability in disease transmission.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million
people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent
research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and
vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors
and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector
infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we
show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay
between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global
stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and
subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot
offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological
trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot
enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their
evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in
disease transmission dynamics.</p>
