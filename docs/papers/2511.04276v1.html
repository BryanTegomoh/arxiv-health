                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study employs a predator-prey mathematical framework to model the interactions between *Aedes* vectors and dengue pathogens, demonstrating how vector competence (vc) is a primary determinant of within-vector infection dynamics and endemic disease persistence. It reveals a fundamental biological trade-off in tropical/subtropical environments where high vector competence cannot be offset by enhanced innate immune capacity, leading to inherent instability in dengue transmission dynamics.</p>

A critical finding is a biological trade-off: under environmental pressures, vectors can increase their transmission potential (vector competence) but cannot concomitantly enhance their innate immune system to offset this, leading to inherent instability in disease transmission.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million
people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent
research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and
vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors
and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector
infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we
show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay
between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global
stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and
subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot
offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological
trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot
enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their
evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in
disease transmission dynamics.</p>
