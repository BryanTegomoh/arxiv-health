                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework using Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) to strictly enforce the "iff" logical constraint often violated by deep learning MIL models. By encoding the MIL assumption through high-dimensional vector operations and employing a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, the method achieves state-of-the-art results on standard and medical imaging datasets while providing a principled and interpretable alternative.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This matters for medicine by enabling more reliable and generalizable AI diagnostics, especially in areas like pathology or radiology where disease presence is determined by specific findings within a larger sample (e.g., a cancerous cell among many healthy ones). Strict adherence to the MIL "iff" constraint ensures that a positive prediction truly correlates with the presence of disease-defining features, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing potential clinical errors.</p>

                <p>The proposed AI framework can be applied to develop more accurate, robust, and interpretable models for analyzing complex medical imaging data. This includes tasks such as classifying whole-slide pathology images for cancer detection (where a slide is positive if any region contains cancer), identifying anomalies in radiological scans, or other diagnostic applications where a 'bag' of instances needs to be classified based on the presence of a single positive instance.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The strict adherence to the "iff" constraint means that AI models developed using this framework will be more trustworthy in clinical diagnostic settings, as their positive predictions will genuinely indicate the presence of at least one positive instance, mirroring expert human reasoning. This could lead to more accurate computer-aided diagnosis, reduced misdiagnosis rates, improved decision support for clinicians, and better generalizability of models across different patient populations or imaging protocols, particularly in areas like digital pathology and radiology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.</p>
