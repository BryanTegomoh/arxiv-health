                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates protein aggregation mechanisms in Huntington's disease (HD), where an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in huntingtin causes a toxic gain of function leading to neuronal death. It outlines two proposed aggregation mechanisms – hydrogen bonding (polar-zipper) and transglutaminase-catalyzed covalent cross-linking – noting that while cell culture models show aggregates primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonds, the nature of these bonds in the brains of HD patients remains unknown and is critical for informing therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.</p>
