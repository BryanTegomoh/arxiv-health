                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper highlights that protein aggregation due to expanded polyglutamine in huntingtin is a likely cause of neuronal death in Huntington's disease. It proposes two main aggregation mechanisms – hydrogen bonding (polar-zipper) and covalent cross-linking (transglutaminase) – noting that while cell culture models show predominant hydrogen bonding, the nature of these stabilizing bonds in patient brains remains unknown, critically influencing therapeutic strategies.</p>

                    <p>Expanded polyglutamine leads to a toxic gain of function in huntingtin, resulting in protein aggregation, which is a likely cause of neuronal death. Proposed stabilization mechanisms include hydrogen bonds (polar-zipper) and covalent bonds (transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking). In cell culture models, hydrogen bonds are the primary stabilizers, but the nature of these bonds in human patient brains is currently unknown.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.</p>
