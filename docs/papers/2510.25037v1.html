                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel graph distance measure for Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs) designed to evaluate causal discovery methods, especially in the presence of latent confounding. The measure quantifies how differences between causal graphs distort cause-effect estimands using identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier, offering a more robust evaluation tool than existing metrics.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as accurate causal inference is foundational for understanding disease mechanisms, developing effective treatments, and designing public health interventions. A robust method for evaluating causal graphs, especially when unobserved factors (latent confounding) influence health outcomes, ensures that medical research derives more reliable insights from observational data.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a critical methodological improvement for Causal AI applications in health. AI systems in medicine often aim to discover causal relationships from complex data (e.g., electronic health records, omics data) to inform decisions such as personalized treatment recommendations, predicting disease progression, identifying drug targets, or evaluating the impact of health policies. The proposed graph distance measure helps to rigorously evaluate the quality and reliability of causal graphs discovered by AI algorithms, particularly when dealing with latent confounders. This, in turn, leads to more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy causal conclusions from medical AI systems, enhancing their utility in clinical practice and health research.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.</p>
