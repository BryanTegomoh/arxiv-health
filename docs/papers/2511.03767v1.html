                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study addressed the intrinsic heterogeneity of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) by analyzing a large-scale, multi-site MRI dataset from the FITBIR repository to discover shared structural injury phenotypes. By harmonizing T1-weighted images, segmenting 132 brain regions, and controlling for confounding factors, the researchers identified significant volumetric differences in 37 ROIs between TBI patients and controls, clustering into three distinct injury patterns encompassing the brainstem, subcortical gray matter, insular cortex, and cerebral/cerebellar white matter.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized T1-weighted MRI data from the FITBIR repository. Initial steps involved harmonizing data to a local dataset, followed by segmenting 132 brain ROIs.

Significant differences between TBI and control groups were determined using independent t-tests with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and subsequent clustering of component loadings were applied to the TBI group to identify distinct injury patterns.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is intrinsically heterogeneous, and typical
clinical outcome measures like the Glasgow Coma Scale complicate this
diversity. The large variability in severity and patient outcomes render it
difficult to link structural damage to functional deficits. The Federal
Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) repository contains
large-scale multi-site magnetic resonance imaging data of varying resolutions
and acquisition parameters (25 shared studies with 7,693 sessions that have
age, sex and TBI status defined - 5,811 TBI and 1,882 controls). To reveal
shared pathways of injury of TBI through imaging, we analyzed T1-weighted
images from these sessions by first harmonizing to a local dataset and
segmenting 132 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain. After running quality
assurance, calculating the volumes of the ROIs, and removing outliers, we
calculated the z-scores of volumes for all participants relative to the mean
and standard deviation of the controls. We regressed out sex, age, and total
brain volume with a multivariate linear regression, and we found significant
differences in 37 ROIs between subjects with TBI and controls (p < 0.05 with
independent t-tests with false discovery rate correction). We found that
differences originated in 1) the brainstem, occipital pole and structures
posterior to the orbit, 2) subcortical gray matter and insular cortex, and 3)
cerebral and cerebellar white matter using independent component analysis and
clustering the component loadings of those with TBI.</p>
