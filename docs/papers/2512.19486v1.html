                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet) to address the combinatorial explosion problem in Deformable Medical Image Registration (DMIR), where dual image inputs lead to exponentially growing feature combinations and interfering features. DySNet dynamically adjusts receptive fields and network weights through its Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) and Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) modules, enabling it to focus on correlated feature relationships and eliminate irrelevant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DySNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DMIR methods, showcasing superior accuracy and generalization ability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Combinatorial explosion problem caused by dual inputs presents a critical challenge in Deformable Medical Image Registration (DMIR). Since DMIR processes two images simultaneously as input, the combination relationships between features has grown exponentially, ultimately the model considers more interfering features during the feature modeling process. Introducing dynamics in the receptive fields and weights of the network enable the model to eliminate the interfering features combination and model the potential feature combination relationships. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships. With two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module dynamically adjusts the shape of the receptive field, thereby enabling the model to focus on the feature relationships with greater correlation. 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships. Extensive experiments have shown that DySNet consistently outperforms the most advanced DMIR methods, highlighting its outstanding generalization ability.
