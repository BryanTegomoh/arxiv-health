                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ContextualSHAP, a Python package that extends the SHAP XAI method by integrating it with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. Addressing SHAP's limitation in providing meaningful context for non-technical users, the tool uses user-defined parameters to tailor explanations. Preliminary user evaluations in a healthcare case study suggest that these combined visual-textual explanations are perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate than visual-only outputs.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research enhances the explainability (XAI) of AI models used in healthcare by providing contextualized, natural language explanations alongside traditional visualizations. This is critical for medical AI applications where clinicians, patients, or administrators need to understand why an AI model made a particular prediction or recommendation (e.g., diagnosis, treatment plan, risk assessment). By making AI explanations more accessible and trustworthy, it facilitates safer and more effective integration of AI into clinical practice and healthcare decision-making, improving user acceptance and supporting more informed actions based on AI outputs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains. Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.</p>
