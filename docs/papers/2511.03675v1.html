                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Whisper Leak is a novel side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. This attack achieves near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) across 28 popular LLMs, even identifying specific sensitive content with 100% precision for certain topics. The findings highlight a significant industry-wide vulnerability that poses severe privacy risks for users in sensitive domains like healthcare, despite TLS encryption.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This attack directly impacts the medical field, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in healthcare for sensitive tasks. It compromises patient and medical professional privacy by allowing inference of confidential health-related prompt topics from seemingly secure, encrypted LLM interactions.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research paper directly addresses a security vulnerability (side-channel attack) in Large Language Models (LLMs), which are a core component of medical AI applications. When LLMs are used in healthcare for tasks such as patient interaction, clinical documentation, diagnostic support, or mental health assistance, this attack could leak sensitive information about patient conditions, diagnoses, treatments, or research topics through metadata analysis, despite encryption. This compromises the privacy and confidentiality essential for healthcare AI applications.</p>

                    <p>The researchers developed and implemented the Whisper Leak attack by analyzing network traffic, specifically focusing on packet size and timing patterns observed during streaming responses from 28 diverse LLMs. They used these metadata fingerprints, which are exposed even through TLS encryption, to train classification models capable of accurately inferring the underlying topics of user prompts.</p>

                    <p>The Whisper Leak attack achieved near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) of user prompt topics across numerous LLMs. It demonstrated robust performance, maintaining high precision even with significant class imbalance, and remarkably achieved 100% precision in identifying specific sensitive topics, recovering a notable percentage (5-20%) of relevant conversations. Crucially, existing and proposed mitigation strategies were found to be insufficient for complete protection.</p>

                <p>The clinical impact is substantial, as it jeopardizes the confidentiality of patient data and medical advice.

                <p>While the paper evaluates several mitigation strategies (random padding, token batching, packet injection), it explicitly states that none provide complete protection against the Whisper Leak attack. This indicates a significant current limitation in securing LLM communications against metadata leakage.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains
including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where
privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack
that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet
size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption
protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to
enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs
from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)
and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target
ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive
topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.
This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under
network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate
three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet
injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides
complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with
providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the
need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle
increasingly sensitive information.</p>
