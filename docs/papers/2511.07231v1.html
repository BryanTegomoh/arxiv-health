                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study develops a remote sensing-driven framework using sub-meter satellite imagery and a semi-supervised segmentation model to quantify Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) accessibility in dense Rohingya refugee camps. The research reveals declining WASH accessibility over time, with an increase from 25 to 29.4 people per facility between 2022 and 2025, and highlights significant gender disparities where women and girls face reduced access due to inadequate safety segregation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Reduced WASH accessibility is a major public health concern in refugee camps, directly impacting disease transmission, morbidity, and mortality. This study provides a method to identify populations at highest risk due to poor access, enabling targeted interventions to mitigate health crises.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research applies machine learning (semi-supervised segmentation framework) to sub-meter satellite imagery to detect individual refugee shelters and subsequently quantify WASH facility accessibility. This AI-driven framework is used to monitor public health infrastructure, identify underserved populations (e.g., women and girls), and inform demand-responsive allocation strategies for WASH facilities, thereby mitigating health risks and improving public health outcomes in complex humanitarian settings.</p>

                <p>This research provides a powerful tool for humanitarian organizations and public health practitioners to monitor and manage WASH infrastructure in dynamic refugee settings. It enables the identification of 'hotspots' or specific demographic groups (e.g., women and girls) with critical unmet WASH needs, allowing for data-driven, demand-responsive allocation of limited resources, thereby potentially reducing outbreaks of WASH-related diseases and improving overall camp health and safety.</p>

                <p>The abstract doesn't explicitly list methodological limitations beyond the 'substantial challenges' of shelter detection. However, the findings highlight the contextual limitation of operating within 'fixed or shrinking budgets,' which constrains the ability to expand infrastructure despite increasing demand, making efficient allocation critical.</p>

                <p>Future research should focus on further refining the remote sensing and machine learning models for even higher accuracy in complex environments. The study also implicitly suggests extending this framework to other humanitarian settings to detect inequalities and inform equitable, demand-responsive resource planning on a broader scale, potentially integrating other socio-economic or health indicators to create more comprehensive vulnerability maps.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services remains a major
public health concern in refugee camps. This study introduces a remote
sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water
pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one
of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee
shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due
to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using
sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework
that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters.
Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH
accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility
availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025.
Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience
reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation
in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive
allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served
populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure
serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking
budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and
machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in
complex humanitarian environments.</p>
