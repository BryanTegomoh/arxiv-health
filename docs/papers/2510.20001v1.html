                    <p>The paper employs a conceptual and review-based methodology. It proposes a novel unifying paradigm for clinical decision-making tasks, which then serves as a framework to analyze and categorize existing medical AI datasets and benchmarks. It also systematically reviews current training-time and test-time methods for improving LLM performance in clinical tasks, and discusses extended evaluation metrics and open challenges. This is a framework-building and analytical review, not an empirical study with new data.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.</p>
