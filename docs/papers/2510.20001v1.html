                    <li>Current LLM evaluations (e.g., MedQA) rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q&A) formats, failing to represent the multifaceted complexity of real-world clinical decision-making.</li>
                    
                    <li>A novel unifying paradigm is proposed, characterizing clinical decision-making tasks across two dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds (e.g., patient history, lab results) and Clinical Questions (e.g., diagnosis, treatment planning).</li>
                    
                    <li>The difficulty of clinical tasks for LLMs is posited to increase proportionally as the 'Clinical Backgrounds' and 'Clinical Questions' dimensions more closely approximate real clinical environments.</li>
                    
                    <li>The paper summarizes existing medical datasets and benchmarks, mapping their settings within the proposed two-dimensional framework to highlight their limitations in capturing real-world complexity.</li>
                    
                    <li>It reviews various methods—including training-time and test-time techniques—used to address clinical decision-making with LLMs, and identifies specific scenarios where these methods provide benefit.</li>
                    
                    <li>Evaluation metrics for LLMs in clinical contexts are expanded beyond traditional accuracy to include crucial performance indicators such as efficiency (e.g., inference speed) and explainability (e.g., rationale generation).</li>
                    
                    <li>The overarching goal of the proposed paradigm is to clarify assumptions in LLM evaluation, standardize comparisons across different models, and provide a clear roadmap for the development of clinically meaningful and deployable LLMs.</li>

                    <p>The paper introduces a conceptual framework, a 'unifying paradigm,' for characterizing clinical decision-making tasks based on two dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. It then performs a literature review, summarizing existing dataset settings and LLM methods within this new framework, and proposes an extension of evaluation criteria to include efficiency and explainability beyond just accuracy.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The core finding is the inadequacy of current LLM evaluation methods, particularly the over-reliance on simplified Q&A, for assessing real-world clinical decision-making. The paper presents a novel two-dimensional paradigm for comprehensively assessing clinical complexity, identifies specific contexts where various training and test-time techniques for LLMs are beneficial, and highlights the necessity of multi-faceted evaluation considering efficiency and explainability alongside accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.</p>
