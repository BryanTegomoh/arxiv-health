                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a new unifying paradigm for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical decision-making, moving beyond simplified Question-Answering datasets like MedQA that underrepresent real-world complexity. The paradigm characterizes tasks along 'Clinical Backgrounds' and 'Clinical Questions' dimensions, aiming to standardize comparisons, clarify assumptions, and guide the development of clinically meaningful LLMs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.</p>
