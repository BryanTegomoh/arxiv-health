                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BadVSFM, the first backdoor attack framework specifically designed for prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs), which are increasingly used in critical applications like digital pathology. It demonstrates that classic backdoor attacks are ineffective, but BadVSFM successfully injects controllable backdoors by manipulating both the encoder and decoder through a novel two-stage process, leading to missegmentation under specific triggers while bypassing existing defenses. The research reveals an underexplored vulnerability in VSFMs, necessitating urgent development of tailored defense mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research investigates security vulnerabilities (backdoor attacks) in AI segmentation models (VSFMs) used within healthcare, specifically highlighting their application in digital pathology. In this context, AI models are used to segment structures within microscope slides (e.g., cells, tissues, lesions) to assist pathologists in diagnosing diseases. A successful backdoor attack could compromise the integrity of these diagnostic AI tools, leading to biased or manipulated segmentation results when a specific trigger is present, thereby affecting patient diagnosis and treatment decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed BadVSFM framework utilizes a two-stage training strategy. Stage 1 focuses on steering the image encoder, using a poisoned dataset to force triggered frames' embeddings towards a designated target while maintaining clean frames' embeddings. Stage 2 trains the mask decoder to produce a shared target mask for triggered frame-prompt pairs, ensuring consistent malicious output, while clean outputs adhere to a reference decoder. Experiments involved evaluating Attack Success Rate (ASR) and clean segmentation quality on two datasets and five VSFMs, complemented by gradient-conflict analysis, attention map visualizations, and ablation studies over various hyper-parameters and settings.</p>

                <p>The findings expose a critical security vulnerability in advanced AI models being adopted in medical applications. If exploited, BadVSFM-type attacks could lead to subtle, conditional errors in the segmentation of medical images (e.g., misidentifying healthy tissue as cancerous or missing a critical lesion when a specific trigger is present), potentially causing misdiagnosis, delayed or inappropriate treatment, and eroding trust in AI-powered diagnostic tools within clinical settings.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.</p>
