                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD) was created by collecting colonoscopy images from routine clinical conditions using Olympus 170 and Pentax i-Scan series endoscopes. Images captured various real-world artifacts (e.g., motion blur, stool, blood). Expert clinicians provided manual binary mask annotations for polyps, which were subsequently reviewed for quality. Baseline performance was evaluated using established deep learning models: VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 for binary classification, and UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones for semantic segmentation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The BPD contains 1,288 polyp images with ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images, comprehensively representing real-world clinical challenges. Benchmarking experiments achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 90.8% (VGG16) and a Dice score of 0.64 for segmentation (InceptionV4-UNet). These results were notably lower than those typically reported on curated datasets, directly demonstrating the significant difficulty posed by the real-world artifacts and variable image quality within the BPD.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This dataset serves as a crucial, more realistic benchmark for developing clinically viable AI models for colonoscopy. Training and evaluating CAD systems on BPD can lead to algorithms that are more resilient to the varied and often imperfect conditions encountered in actual clinical settings, especially in resource-limited environments, thereby potentially enhancing early polyp detection rates and contributing to reduced colorectal cancer mortality.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Objective: Colorectal cancer prevention relies on early
detection of polyps during colonoscopy. Existing public datasets, such as
CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by
small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts.
There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical
practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce
a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using
Olympus 170 and Pen- tax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical
conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated
binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular
highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were
manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate
baseline performance, we provide bench- mark results for classification using
VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with
VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises
1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth
masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments
achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum
Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation. Performance was
lower compared to curated datasets, reflecting the real-world difficulty of
images with artifacts and variable quality.</p>
