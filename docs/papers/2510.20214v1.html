                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised framework designed for objective and accurate fetal movement (FM) detection from ultrasound videos. Addressing the subjectivity of traditional methods, CURL utilizes a dual-contrastive loss and a task-specific sampling strategy to learn robust motion representations. Evaluated on an in-house dataset, it achieved a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating potential for improved prenatal monitoring.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate and objective fetal movement detection is vital for assessing prenatal health, as abnormal patterns can signal underlying complications like placental dysfunction or fetal distress. This research offers a non-invasive, more reliable method to identify such critical indicators earlier and more consistently.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves a self-supervised learning framework (CURL) leveraging contrastive learning on fetal ultrasound video recordings. Its purpose is to objectively and reliably detect fetal movements, providing a more accurate and less subjective assessment than traditional methods. This AI-driven analysis of medical imaging data directly supports improved prenatal monitoring, helps clinicians in diagnosing potential complications like fetal distress or placental dysfunction, and ultimately aids in better clinical decision-making for maternal and fetal health.</p>

                <p>The evaluation was performed on an 'in-house dataset,' which may limit the generalizability of the results to diverse patient populations, different ultrasound machine types, or varied clinical settings. While promising, the reported sensitivity and AUROC suggest there is still room for improvement in accuracy and robustness for widespread clinical deployment. The abstract does not detail the specificity or the types of 'abnormal movement patterns' that can be identified.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.</p>
