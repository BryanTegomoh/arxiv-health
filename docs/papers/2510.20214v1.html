                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised learning framework for objective and accurate fetal movement (FM) detection from extended ultrasound videos. By employing a dual-contrastive loss and a task-specific sampling strategy, CURL learns robust motion representations, achieving a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60% on an in-house dataset. The framework holds significant potential for enhancing prenatal health monitoring and clinical decision-making by providing an objective assessment of fetal activity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.</p>
