                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces EXCAP, a novel self-explainable AI framework designed for modeling long time series, which addresses limitations of existing methods by generating pattern-centric, causally disentangled explanations. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism to provide robust and coherent temporal explanations. The framework achieves strong predictive accuracy in classification and forecasting while delivering interpretable insights, making it highly relevant for high-stakes domains like healthcare.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>EXCAP is a deep learning framework built on three interconnected components: 1) an attention-based segmenter that identifies and extracts coherent temporal patterns from long time series, 2) a causally structured decoder, guided by an external pre-trained causal graph, which disentangles and interprets the causal relationships within the extracted patterns, and 3) a latent aggregation mechanism that ensures stability and consistency of learned representations, contributing to smooth explanations over time. This architecture is designed to fulfill the proposed requirements of temporal continuity, pattern-centricity, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The EXCAP framework successfully delivers smooth and stable explanations over time, demonstrating temporal continuity and robustness to causal mask perturbations. It achieves strong predictive accuracy on both classification and forecasting tasks while simultaneously generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These findings indicate that EXCAP effectively addresses the limitations of prior XAI methods by providing more structured, interpretable insights into long time series data.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>EXCAP has the potential to revolutionize clinical decision support by providing transparent and actionable insights into patient data. For instance, it could explain *why* a patient is at high risk for sepsis based on specific patterns of vital signs and lab results over time, rather than just predicting the risk. This deeper understanding enables clinicians to validate AI suggestions, make more informed decisions, develop personalized treatment strategies, and build greater trust in AI systems for critical applications like early warning scores, disease trajectory prediction, and drug efficacy monitoring.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract primarily highlights the limitations of *existing* explainable AI methods (point-wise scores, failure to capture temporal structure, weakened trust). While EXCAP aims to overcome these, a potential implicit limitation for EXCAP itself is its reliance on a "pre-trained causal graph," which can be complex to derive accurately for intricate biological systems and may require extensive domain expertise or specialized causal discovery techniques.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The paper suggests EXCAP offers a "principled and scalable approach" for interpretable modeling. Future research could involve extending EXCAP's application to even more diverse and complex multi-modal medical time series, exploring methods for automated or semi-automated causal graph discovery from data, and developing human-computer interaction designs optimized for clinicians to effectively leverage EXCAP's structured, pattern-centric explanations in real-time clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Explainability is essential for neural networks that model long time series, yet most existing explainable AI methods only produce point-wise importance scores and fail to capture temporal structures such as trends, cycles, and regime changes. This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.</p>
