                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an SIRWS epidemiological model to analyze the re-emergence of pertussis, focusing on the interplay between infection-acquired and vaccine-acquired immunity durations. It reveals that differences in these immunity durations profoundly influence long-term disease patterns, with vaccination potentially inducing cyclic behavior and increased vaccine coverage paradoxically leading to increased overall transmission despite reducing primary infections, alongside longer, taller epidemic cycles.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a compartmental epidemiological model, specifically an SIRWS model (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Waning-Susceptible or similar, implying a return to susceptibility). A core feature of the methodology is allowing the duration of infection-acquired immunity to be distinct from that of vaccine-acquired immunity. The model is used to analyze long-term disease patterns and the prevalence of infection.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Vaccination may induce cyclic epidemiological behavior. The ability of vaccination to reduce infection prevalence increases with both the duration of infection-acquired immunity and vaccine-acquired immunity. Increasing vaccine coverage always reduces the prevalence of primary infections but can lead to an increase in overall transmission, resulting in epidemic cycles with longer interepidemic periods and taller peaks. Epidemiological patterns change significantly when vaccine-acquired and infection-acquired immunity durations differ.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>These findings directly influence vaccine program design, suggesting that vaccination schedules and booster strategies should consider the specific durations of both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. It prompts a re-evaluation of high vaccine coverage impacts, necessitating refined surveillance for changes in epidemic periodicity and intensity, and potentially leading to more targeted and effective public health interventions for diseases like pertussis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite high vaccine coverage, pertussis has re-emerged as a public health concern in many countries. One hypothesis posed for re-emergence is the waning of immunity. In some disease systems, the process of waning immunity can be non-linear, involving a complex relationship between the duration of immunity and subsequent boosting of immunity through asymptomatic re-exposure.
  We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission to examine the interplay between infection and immunity. By allowing the duration of infection-acquired immunity to differ from that of vaccine-acquired immunity, we explore the impact of the difference in durations on long-term disease patterns and prevalence of infection.
  Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and its ability to reduce the infection prevalence increases with both the duration of infection-acquired immunity and duration of vaccine-acquired immunity. We find that increasing vaccine coverage, while capable of leading to an increase in overall transmission, always results in a reduction in prevalence of primary infections, with epidemic cycles characterised by a longer interepidemic period and taller peaks.
  Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease may change considerably when the duration of vaccine-acquired immunity differs from that of infection-acquired immunity. Our study highlights that for any particular disease and associated vaccine, a detailed understanding of the duration of protection and how that duration is influenced by infection prevalence is important as we seek to optimise vaccination strategies.</p>
