                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper analyzes an SIRWS epidemiological model to investigate the impact of differing durations between infection-acquired and vaccine-acquired immunity on infectious disease dynamics, particularly in the context of pertussis re-emergence. It reveals that such differences can induce cyclic behavior, alter overall transmission patterns, and significantly influence long-term disease prevalence, challenging conventional assumptions about high vaccine coverage.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is critically important for public health planning and vaccine policy, especially for diseases like pertussis where re-emergence occurs despite high vaccination rates. It offers a mechanistic understanding of how immunity waning and differential protection durations can impact disease dynamics, guiding more effective intervention strategies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper utilizes an SIRWS mathematical model for disease transmission, which falls under computational modeling in epidemiology. However, it does not describe the application of artificial intelligence techniques (such as machine learning, deep learning, or advanced predictive AI algorithms) to health data or problems. It is a foundational epidemiological modeling study, not an AI application.</p>

                <p>This study has direct implications for designing and refining vaccination strategies and schedules, particularly for diseases with waning immunity. It suggests that vaccine coverage alone might not be a sufficient metric for disease control if immunity durations differ significantly, emphasizing the need for robust booster programs or vaccine development focusing on longer-lasting immunity. Public health officials should consider detailed immunological data, beyond just coverage rates, to predict and manage disease outbreaks effectively.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite high vaccine coverage, pertussis has re-emerged as a public health concern in many countries. One hypothesis posed for re-emergence is the waning of immunity. In some disease systems, the process of waning immunity can be non-linear, involving a complex relationship between the duration of immunity and subsequent boosting of immunity through asymptomatic re-exposure.
  We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission to examine the interplay between infection and immunity. By allowing the duration of infection-acquired immunity to differ from that of vaccine-acquired immunity, we explore the impact of the difference in durations on long-term disease patterns and prevalence of infection.
  Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and its ability to reduce the infection prevalence increases with both the duration of infection-acquired immunity and duration of vaccine-acquired immunity. We find that increasing vaccine coverage, while capable of leading to an increase in overall transmission, always results in a reduction in prevalence of primary infections, with epidemic cycles characterised by a longer interepidemic period and taller peaks.
  Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease may change considerably when the duration of vaccine-acquired immunity differs from that of infection-acquired immunity. Our study highlights that for any particular disease and associated vaccine, a detailed understanding of the duration of protection and how that duration is influenced by infection prevalence is important as we seek to optimise vaccination strategies.</p>
