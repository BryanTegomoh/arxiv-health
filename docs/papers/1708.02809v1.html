                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops an SIRWS compartmental model to investigate the impact of differing durations between infection-acquired and vaccine-acquired immunity on long-term disease patterns, specifically in the context of pertussis re-emergence. The model demonstrates that vaccination can induce cyclic epidemic behavior, and while increasing vaccine coverage reduces primary infections, it can paradoxically increase overall transmission and alter epidemic dynamics, leading to longer interepidemic periods and taller peaks.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides a crucial theoretical framework for understanding complex epidemiological dynamics in vaccinated populations, particularly for diseases like pertussis where re-emergence is a concern despite high coverage. It offers insights into why vaccine effectiveness might be less straightforward than anticipated and highlights the critical data needed for evidence-based public health interventions.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a compartmental mathematical model of infectious disease transmission, referred to as an SIRWS model. This model was specifically designed to differentiate and analyze the impact of varying durations of immunity acquired through natural infection versus vaccination on long-term disease patterns and prevalence.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The model demonstrates that vaccination can induce cyclic epidemic behavior, and its effectiveness in reducing infection prevalence is directly proportional to the duration of both infection-acquired and vaccine-acquired immunity. Critically, increasing vaccine coverage, while reducing primary infections, can paradoxically increase overall transmission and lead to epidemic cycles with longer interepidemic periods and taller peaks. Epidemiological patterns change considerably when immunity durations differ.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>These findings suggest that simply maximizing vaccine coverage might not suffice for optimal disease control and could lead to shifts in epidemic patterns (e.g., less frequent but more severe outbreaks). Clinicians and public health practitioners must consider the qualitative aspects of immunity (duration, source) when designing and evaluating vaccination programs. This implies a need for sustained surveillance of vaccine effectiveness and immunity duration post-vaccination or infection.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Despite high vaccine coverage, pertussis has re-emerged as a public health concern in many countries. One hypothesis posed for re-emergence is the waning of immunity. In some disease systems, the process of waning immunity can be non-linear, involving a complex relationship between the duration of immunity and subsequent boosting of immunity through asymptomatic re-exposure.
  We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission to examine the interplay between infection and immunity. By allowing the duration of infection-acquired immunity to differ from that of vaccine-acquired immunity, we explore the impact of the difference in durations on long-term disease patterns and prevalence of infection.
  Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and its ability to reduce the infection prevalence increases with both the duration of infection-acquired immunity and duration of vaccine-acquired immunity. We find that increasing vaccine coverage, while capable of leading to an increase in overall transmission, always results in a reduction in prevalence of primary infections, with epidemic cycles characterised by a longer interepidemic period and taller peaks.
  Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease may change considerably when the duration of vaccine-acquired immunity differs from that of infection-acquired immunity. Our study highlights that for any particular disease and associated vaccine, a detailed understanding of the duration of protection and how that duration is influenced by infection prevalence is important as we seek to optimise vaccination strategies.</p>
