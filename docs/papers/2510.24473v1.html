                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study presents a comparative methodological analysis of six machine
learning models for survival analysis (MLSA). Using data from nearly 45,000
colorectal cancer patients in the Hospital-Based Cancer Registries of S\~ao
Paulo, we evaluated Random Survival Forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting for
Survival Analysis (GBSA), Survival SVM (SSVM), XGBoost-Cox (XGB-Cox),
XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM), capable of predicting survival
considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with
different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance
Index (C-Index), C-Index IPCW, time-dependent AUC, and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Survival curves produced by the models were compared with predictions
from classification algorithms, and predictor interpretation was conducted
using SHAP and permutation importance. XGB-AFT achieved the best performance
(C-Index = 0.7618; IPCW = 0.7532), followed by GBSA and RSF. The results
highlight the potential and applicability of MLSA to improve survival
prediction and support decision making.</p>
