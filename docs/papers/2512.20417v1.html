                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that enhances anomaly detection in automated video surveillance by mitigating Large Vision-Language Models' (LVLMs) inherent bias towards normality. CoAT incorporates an inductive criminal bias and an anomaly-focused classification layer, significantly boosting F1-score for Anomaly Detection by 11.8 percentage points in low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 percentage points in high-resolution videos.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research has significant medical relevance for enhancing automated surveillance and monitoring in healthcare settings, enabling earlier detection of critical patient events, deviations from medical protocols, or security breaches. By overcoming the bias towards normality, CoAT could be adapted to identify rare but crucial anomalies in patient vital signs (if visualized), surgical videos, or elderly care monitoring, where prompt intervention is often life-saving.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This AI method could be applied to automatically analyze video feeds in healthcare settings (hospitals, assisted living facilities, home care) or biological research laboratories to detect critical anomalies. Examples include identifying patient falls, monitoring for self-harm behaviors, detecting seizures, recognizing unauthorized personnel in restricted areas, ensuring compliance with safety protocols in labs, or identifying unusual activity that could indicate a biosecurity threat (e.g., spills, improper handling of pathogens).</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT) is proposed as a multi-agent reasoning framework. It specifically addresses the inherent bias of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) towards normality by integrating an 'inductive criminal bias' into the reasoning process. A key component is a final, anomaly-focused classification layer that guides the model to prioritize and identify anomalous events over normal interpretations, diverging from standard Chain-of-Thought approaches.</p>

                <p>The capability to robustly detect rare and critical anomalies in real-time video or visual data has substantial clinical impact. This could lead to earlier intervention for patient falls, seizures, or other acute changes in status; identify unusual patient behaviors indicative of worsening conditions; flag critical deviations during surgical procedures; or enhance security in sensitive clinical environments, ultimately improving patient safety and outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.</p>
