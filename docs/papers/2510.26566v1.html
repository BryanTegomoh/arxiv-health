                <p>This research aims to improve the reliability and fairness of AI models used across healthcare. By addressing multiclass local calibration, it helps ensure that predicted probabilities from models (e.g., for disease likelihood, treatment response, or patient risk scores) accurately reflect true frequencies, particularly for rare or underrepresented patient groups (sparse instances). This prevents potential biases in AI-driven diagnoses, treatment recommendations, or risk assessments, leading to more trustworthy, ethical, and equitable AI applications in clinical decision support, diagnostic tools, and predictive analytics within healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.</p>
