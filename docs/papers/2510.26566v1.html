                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical problem of proximity bias in multiclass calibration, where machine learning models miscalibrate predictions in sparse regions of the feature space, particularly problematic in high-stakes areas like healthcare. The authors introduce and formally define "multiclass local calibration," propose a novel method for Neural Networks that leverages the Jensen-Shannon distance to align predicted probabilities with local class frequency estimates, and empirically demonstrate its superiority over existing calibration techniques.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for healthcare as it directly tackles the issue of ML model miscalibration for rare or unusual patient cases, which often correspond to high-risk individuals. By ensuring predictions are trustworthy even in data-sparse regions, it reduces the potential for biased clinical decisions and enhances patient safety, particularly for those who might otherwise be overlooked or poorly served by standard models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.</p>
