                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate detailed staff and resident interactions within Australian aged care facilities, generating comprehensive contact matrices. It revealed significant heterogeneity in contact patterns across different care levels and staff shifts, and demonstrated the ABM's utility in evaluating targeted infection control strategies, including vaccination, to substantially reduce airborne transmission risk.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical insights into the complex contact dynamics governing pathogen transmission in high-risk aged care environments. The developed ABM offers a valuable tool for designing data-driven, targeted infection prevention and control strategies, including optimized vaccination programs and activity-specific interventions, to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The agent-based model (ABM) employed in this study serves as a computational application to simulate complex health-related phenomena. While not 'AI' in the machine learning sense, ABMs are powerful computational tools used to model disease dynamics, predict outcomes, and evaluate interventions in public health and clinical settings, thereby informing decision-making for health management and biosecurity strategies. In this context, it's an application of computational modeling to solve a medical/health problem.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate interactions between staff and residents in a synthetic aged care facility. Contacts were defined by spatial proximity (1.5 m and 3 m) and cumulative duration.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Low and medium care residents, particularly those interacting with morning and afternoon shift staff, experienced the highest frequency of contacts. High care residents and night staff had substantially fewer interactions, with contact rates varying significantly by care level and shift. High-risk contacts were found to cluster during structured daily routines like communal and direct care activities. The transmission module indicated that infection risk was highest during high-contact shifts and among medium care residents, and that vaccination could reduce predicted transmission by up to 68%, with optimal impact when both staff and residents were vaccinated.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings underscore the importance of understanding and addressing contact heterogeneity within aged care facilities. Clinically, the ABM can be leveraged to identify specific high-risk groups (e.g., medium care residents) and high-risk periods (e.g., specific shifts or communal activities) for targeted infection control interventions. This includes optimizing staff rostering, implementing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols during high-contact activities, and prioritizing vaccination efforts for specific staff and resident cohorts to effectively mitigate the spread of airborne pathogens.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate staff and resident interactions within a synthetic aged care facility, capturing movement, task execution, and proximity-based contact events across three staff shifts and varying levels of resident care. Contacts were defined by spatial thresholds (1.5 m and 3 m) and cumulative duration, enabling the generation of detailed contact matrices. Simulation results showed that low and medium care residents experienced the highest frequency of interactions, particularly with staff on morning and afternoon shifts, while high care residents and night staff had substantially fewer contacts. Contact rates varied significantly by care level and shift, confirmed through Poisson-based regression modelling. Temporal analyses revealed clustering of high-risk contacts during structured daily routines, especially communal and care activities. An integrated airborne transmission module, seeded with a single infectious staff member, demonstrated that infection risk was highest during high-contact shifts and among medium care residents. Vaccination scenarios reduced predicted transmission by up to 68\%, with the greatest impact observed when both staff and residents were vaccinated. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for contact heterogeneity in aged care and demonstrate the utility of ABMs for evaluating targeted infection control strategies in high-risk, enclosed environments.</p>
