                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research developed and compared a multi-modal approach, combining Vision Transformers (EVA-ViT) with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama or ChatGPT, within Text-RAG and Image-RAG frameworks for disease detection in chest X-ray images. The study aimed to mitigate LLM hallucination and improve diagnostic accuracy. It found that Text-RAG effectively reduces hallucination using external knowledge, while Image-RAG improves prediction confidence and calibration via KNN methods, with GPT LLM demonstrating superior performance, lower hallucination, and better calibration than Llama.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This research analyzed and compared the multi-modal approach in the Vision Transformer(EVA-ViT) based image encoder with the LlaMA or ChatGPT LLM to reduce the hallucination problem and detect diseases in chest x-ray images. In this research, we utilized the NIH Chest X-ray image to train the model and compared it in image-based RAG, text-based RAG, and baseline. [3] [5] In a result, the text-based RAG[2] e!ectively reduces the hallucination problem by using external knowledge information, and the image-based RAG improved the prediction con"dence and calibration by using the KNN methods. [4] Moreover, the GPT LLM showed better performance, a low hallucination rate, and better Expected Calibration Error(ECE) than Llama Llama-based model. This research shows the challenge of data imbalance, a complex multi-stage structure, but suggests a large experience environment and a balanced example of use.</p>
