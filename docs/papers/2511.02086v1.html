                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper develops and clinically evaluates a novel depth-only, markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline using a head-mounted display (HMD) for surgical guidance on small or low-curvature anatomies. The system achieved a median intraoperative registration error of approximately 3-4 mm across feet, ear, and lower leg, approaching typical clinical thresholds for moderate-risk surgical tasks without the need for fiducials.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes an Augmented Reality (AR) registration pipeline for surgical guidance. This system leverages computer vision techniques (e.g., depth-only markerless registration, 3D model alignment using global and local registration) to accurately overlay virtual anatomical data onto a patient's real anatomy in real-time. While 'AI' is not explicitly mentioned, these advanced computer vision and registration algorithms often incorporate or are foundational to AI/machine learning methods for robust performance in complex clinical environments, qualifying it as a medical AI application focused on enhancing surgical precision and navigation.</p>

                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>A depth-only, markerless AR registration pipeline was developed for HoloLens 2, aligning AHAT depth data to CT-derived skin meshes through depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global/local registration.</li>
                    
                    <li>Preclinical validation using AR-tracked tools on leg and foot models demonstrated high accuracy, with median absolute differences of 0.78 mm (leg) and 0.80 mm (feet) between AR-traced and CT ground truth distances.</li>
                    
                    <li>Clinical accuracy was assessed in seven intraoperative trials (feet, ear, lower leg) during fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgeries, collecting over 500 data points per trial.</li>
                    
                    <li>The overall clinical per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm, with anatomy-specific medians of 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg).</li>
                    
                    <li>Error coverage within 5 mm was high: 92-95% for feet, 84-90% for ear, and 72-86% for the lower leg. Accuracy on feet was significantly better than the lower leg (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001).</li>
                    
                    <li>The inclusion of human-guided initialization combined with global-to-local registration proved crucial for achieving accurate alignment on anatomies with limited curvature or small size.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized a HoloLens 2 HMD to develop a depth-only, markerless AR registration pipeline. This pipeline aligned AHAT (Articulated HAnd Tracking) depth data with CT-derived skin meshes via sequential steps: depth-bias correction, a brief human-in-the-loop initialization, followed by global and local registration. Preclinical validation involved comparing AR-traced "skin-to-bone" distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot models. Clinical validation included seven intraoperative trials across different anatomies (feet, ear, lower leg) during fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgeries, collecting extensive per-point error data.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Preclinical validation demonstrated sub-millimeter accuracy (median |Delta d| 0.78-0.80 mm, RMSE 0.97-1.20 mm). Clinically, the overall median per-point registration error was 3.9 mm. Anatomy-specific median errors were 3.2 mm for feet, 4.3 mm for the ear, and 5.3 mm for the lower leg. The system achieved a 5 mm error coverage ranging from 72% to 95%, depending on the anatomy. Accuracy was significantly better for feet compared to the lower leg (p < 0.001).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This markerless AR registration system offers a highly practical solution for surgical guidance, eliminating the need for fiducials and thereby reducing pre-operative preparation time and potential patient discomfort. Its ~3-4 mm median accuracy, particularly in live surgical settings, is clinically acceptable for moderate-risk procedures, enhancing precision in reconstructive surgeries like fibula free-flap and mandibular reconstruction, and potentially broadening the application of AR in surgery.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While achieving significant accuracy for moderate-risk tasks, the system's median error (up to 5.3 mm for the lower leg) might not meet the stringent sub-millimeter requirements for all high-precision surgical interventions. The pipeline requires brief human-in-the-loop initialization, indicating it is not fully autonomous. The study focused on small or low-curvature anatomies; performance on larger or more complex anatomical structures is not detailed.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The conclusion of "improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance" suggests future work could focus on further enhancing accuracy to meet higher precision demands, expanding validation to a wider range of anatomies and surgical procedures, and optimizing the human-in-the-loop initialization to further streamline the surgical workflow.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.</p>
