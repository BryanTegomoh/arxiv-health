                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MedSegLatDiff, a novel diffusion-based framework that addresses the computational heaviness of generative models for medical image segmentation while enabling the generation of multiple plausible segmentation masks and capturing inherent uncertainty. By combining a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model, the framework operates efficiently in a low-dimensional latent space and achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on diverse medical image datasets, providing enhanced interpretability and reliability for clinical use.</p>

                    <p>MedSegLatDiff integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for encoding input medical images into a compact, low-dimensional latent space. This latent space representation is then used by a diffusion model to generate diverse segmentation masks.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.</p>
