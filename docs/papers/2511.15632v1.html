                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved the retrospective collection of 2,735,269 12-lead ECGs from over 2 million adult patients from the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais. These ECGs were then annotated using standardized diagnostic criteria to derive 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, with each annotation reviewed by cardiologists. The utility of CODE-II was demonstrated by pre-training a neural network on the dataset and evaluating its transfer performance on external, established benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018), comparing its efficacy against models trained on other large datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The key finding is the successful creation and validation of CODE-II as a high-quality, large-scale dataset for ECG AI. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II exhibited superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) compared to existing AI models, including those trained on other larger datasets. This underscores CODE-II's unique value in addressing critical data limitations for robust AI development in ECG analysis.</p>

                <p>CODE-II's comprehensive and cardiologist-validated annotations, combined with its vast scale, will enable the development of more accurate and generalizable AI algorithms for automated ECG interpretation. This has the potential to streamline diagnostic workflows, improve the early detection of a wide range of cardiac abnormalities, reduce the burden on clinicians, particularly in resource-constrained or telehealth settings, and ultimately enhance patient management and outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Data-driven methods for electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation are rapidly progressing. Large datasets have enabled advances in artificial intelligence (AI) based ECG analysis, yet limitations in annotation quality, size, and scope remain major challenges. Here we present CODE-II, a large-scale real-world dataset of 2,735,269 12-lead ECGs from 2,093,807 adult patients collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), Brazil. Each exam was annotated using standardized diagnostic criteria and reviewed by cardiologists. A defining feature of CODE-II is a set of 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, developed with cardiologist input and routinely used in telehealth practice. We additionally provide an open available subset: CODE-II-open, a public subset of 15,000 patients, and the CODE-II-test, a non-overlapping set of 8,475 exams reviewed by multiple cardiologists for blinded evaluation. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II achieved superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) and outperformed alternatives trained on larger datasets.</p>
