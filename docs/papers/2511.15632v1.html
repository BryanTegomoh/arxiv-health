                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The CODE-II dataset was compiled from a large collection of real-world 12-lead ECGs from adult patients in a telehealth network. Each ECG was annotated by clinicians using standardized diagnostic criteria and subsequently reviewed by cardiologists, resulting in 66 clinically relevant diagnostic classes. The dataset's utility was evaluated by training a neural network on CODE-II and then assessing its transfer performance (generalization ability) on external benchmark ECG datasets (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018), comparing its performance against alternative models trained on other datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that neural networks pre-trained on the CODE-II dataset achieve superior transfer performance on well-known external ECG benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018). This performance was notably better than that of alternative models, even those trained on datasets that were potentially larger, highlighting the quality and clinical relevance of CODE-II's annotations and scope.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>CODE-II's high-quality, large-scale, and clinically relevant data can significantly accelerate the development of more accurate, reliable, and interpretable AI systems for automated ECG interpretation. This can lead to improved diagnostic efficiency, enhanced support for telehealth services in cardiology, reduced workload for cardiologists, and potentially better cardiovascular disease management and patient outcomes, particularly in resource-constrained settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Data-driven methods for electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation are rapidly progressing. Large datasets have enabled advances in artificial intelligence (AI) based ECG analysis, yet limitations in annotation quality, size, and scope remain major challenges. Here we present CODE-II, a large-scale real-world dataset of 2,735,269 12-lead ECGs from 2,093,807 adult patients collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), Brazil. Each exam was annotated using standardized diagnostic criteria and reviewed by cardiologists. A defining feature of CODE-II is a set of 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, developed with cardiologist input and routinely used in telehealth practice. We additionally provide an open available subset: CODE-II-open, a public subset of 15,000 patients, and the CODE-II-test, a non-overlapping set of 8,475 exams reviewed by multiple cardiologists for blinded evaluation. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II achieved superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) and outperformed alternatives trained on larger datasets.</p>
