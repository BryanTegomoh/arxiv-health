                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study presents a novel recurrent fusion model for detecting alcohol intoxication from facial video sequences. The model combines facial landmark analysis via a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with spatiotemporal visual features extracted by a 3D ResNet, employing dynamic adaptive prioritization for feature fusion. Achieving 95.82% accuracy, 0.977 precision, and 0.97 recall on a new curated dataset, the approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and shows promise for practical deployment in public safety.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern and a major cause of accidents and fatalities worldwide. This study introduces a novel video-based facial sequence analysis approach dedicated to the detection of alcohol intoxication. The method integrates facial landmark analysis via a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with spatiotemporal visual features extracted using a 3D ResNet. These features are dynamically fused with adaptive prioritization to enhance classification performance. Additionally, we introduce a curated dataset comprising 3,542 video segments derived from 202 individuals to support training and evaluation. Our model is compared against two baselines: a custom 3D-CNN and a VGGFace+LSTM architecture. Experimental results show that our approach achieves 95.82% accuracy, 0.977 precision, and 0.97 recall, outperforming prior methods. The findings demonstrate the model's potential for practical deployment in public safety systems for non-invasive, reliable alcohol intoxication detection.</p>
