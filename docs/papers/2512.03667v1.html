                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Colon-X is an open initiative introducing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset for colonoscopy, aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence. The study highlights the unreliable nature of current MLLMs for clinical outputs and proposes a novel approach to clinical reasoning, culminating in ColonReason, a new reasoning dataset, and ColonR1, a model that achieves 56.61% accuracy under data-scarce conditions, significantly outperforming supervised fine-tuning.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is vital for improving the precision and reliability of colonoscopy analysis, which is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancers and polyps, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and supporting gastroenterologists in complex diagnostic decision-making.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application involves creating multimodal intelligence systems to process visual and textual data from colonoscopies. These systems aim to assist or automate tasks such as identifying and characterizing clinical findings (e.g., polyps, lesions), answering clinical questions, and supporting clinical reasoning for diagnosis and management. This can improve the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of colonoscopy examinations, potentially leading to earlier detection of colorectal diseases and better patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In this study, we present Colon-X, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy. We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.
