                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the Improving Multi-Armed Bandits (IMAB) problem, relevant to scenarios like clinical trials, where rewards increase monotonically with diminishing returns, and prior algorithms had pessimistic worst-case guarantees. The authors propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms that achieve stronger, data-dependent guarantees by learning near-optimal algorithms from offline data. The first family yields optimal dependence on the number of arms under specific concavity conditions, while the second provides robust performance, guaranteeing best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and gracefully degrading on poorly-behaved ones without requiring explicit assumption verification.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The algorithms developed in this paper can be applied to optimize the design and execution of clinical trials, for example, by intelligently allocating patients to different treatment arms or deciding which experimental treatments to prioritize. It could also be used to optimize resource allocation in medical research, guiding where to invest effort to develop new medical technologies or therapies. Potentially, it could also inform adaptive treatment strategies in personalized medicine where 'arms' represent different interventions and 'rewards' are patient outcomes that improve with effort/time.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.</p>
