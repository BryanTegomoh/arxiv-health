                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed a data-driven method using electronic health record (EHR) data to characterize the progression from acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD). By identifying fifteen distinct post-AKI clinical states and their varying CKD risks, the research offers a novel approach to pinpoint high-risk AKI patients more precisely. This paves the way for targeted early interventions and the development of intelligent decision-support tools in clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant for improving patient outcomes by enabling earlier and more precise identification of AKI patients at elevated risk of developing CKD. Such stratification allows for personalized monitoring, preventative interventions, and resource allocation, potentially slowing or preventing CKD progression.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes the development of a data-driven approach using AI/ML techniques (clustering, multi-state modeling, survival analysis) to characterize disease progression from AKI to CKD. This forms the foundation for AI-driven decision-support tools designed to identify high-risk AKI patients, enable early CKD detection, and guide timely interventions in clinical practice. It aims to improve patient outcomes by personalizing risk assessment and informing therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.</p>
