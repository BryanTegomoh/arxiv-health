                    <p>The core methodology involves averaging estimates obtained from multiple, distinct random splits of a dataset for training and testing. It mathematically accounts for the resulting statistical dependence among these averaged estimates by proving a new Central Limit Theorem.

This is often implemented using repeated cross-fitting.</p>

                    <p>A new Central Limit Theorem validates inference for split-sample estimators averaged across multiple splits, accommodating observation reuse without strict model assumptions. While normal approximation-based confidence intervals are valid for many direct split-sample estimations, they critically undercover when comparing two models or complex performance metrics. A novel inference approach explicitly corrects for dependence across splits, yielding valid confidence intervals and improved statistical power in challenging comparison scenarios. The proposed method, especially with repeated cross-fitting, significantly enhances statistical power, allowing for the detection of subtle but important effects that previous methods might miss.</p>

It allows clinicians and researchers to make more confident decisions based on predictive models, potentially accelerating the translation of robust research findings into clinical practice. For instance, it could more reliably confirm which of two AI diagnostic tools performs significantly better in a clinical context.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As predictive algorithms grow in popularity, using the same dataset to both
train and test a new model has become routine across research, policy, and
industry. Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using
separate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this
approach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and
different splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across
multiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for
training, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I
address the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by
proving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample
estimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no
restrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence
intervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications,
but may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the
performance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such
cases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I
provide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample
estimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in
development and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous
treatment effects in randomized experiments. I show that my inference approach
with repeated cross-fitting achieves better power than previous alternatives,
often enough to find statistical significance that would otherwise be missed.</p>
