                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Repurposing existing drugs to treat new diseases is a cost-effective
alternative to de novo drug development, but there are millions of potential
drug-disease combinations to be considered with only a small fraction being
viable. In silico predictions of drug-disease associations can be invaluable
for reducing the size of the search space. In this work we present a novel
network of drugs and the diseases they treat, compiled using a combination of
existing textual and machine-readable databases, natural-language processing
tools, and hand curation, and analyze it using network-based link prediction
methods to identify potential drug-disease combinations. We measure the
efficacy of these methods using cross-validation tests and find that several
methods, particularly those based on graph embedding and network model fitting,
achieve impressive prediction performance, significantly better than previous
approaches, with area under the ROC curve above 0.95 and average precision
almost a thousand times better than chance.</p>
