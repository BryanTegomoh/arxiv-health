                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenge of under-segmentation of small cerebral lesions by traditional loss functions in medical image analysis. It introduces CC-DiceCE, a novel instance-wise loss function designed to improve detection on a per-lesion basis. The study demonstrates that CC-DiceCE significantly increases lesion detection (recall) with minimal impact on segmentation quality, outperforming existing methods like blob loss, albeit with a slight increase in false positives.</p>

                    <p>The study introduced CC-DiceCE, a new instance-wise loss function built upon the CC-Metrics framework. This novel loss was implemented and rigorously compared against a traditional DiceCE baseline and an existing blob loss.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.</p>
