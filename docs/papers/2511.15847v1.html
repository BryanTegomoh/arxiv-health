                    <p>The study utilizes a late-fusion multimodal ensemble architecture. It processes physiological time-series measurements (vitals) with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and unstructured clinical notes with a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer.

                    <p>The multimodal ensemble model significantly improved predictive performance on the MIMIC-III benchmark, yielding an AUPRC of 0.565 and an AUROC of 0.891, which are superior to the best single-modality model (AUPRC 0.526; AUROC 0.876). The system maintained well-calibrated predictions and demonstrated robustness through a calibrated fallback mechanism when a modality was missing. A key finding is its provision of multilevel interpretability, offering both feature attributions within modalities and per-case modality attributions to explain risk predictions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.</p>
