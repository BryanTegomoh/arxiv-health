                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a transparent and lightweight multimodal ensemble model for early in-hospital mortality prediction in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, leveraging physiological time-series and unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours. By combining a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT for notes with a logistic regression, the system significantly improves predictive performance (AUPRC 0.565, AUROC 0.891) on MIMIC-III while offering crucial per-case modality and feature-level interpretability, alongside robustness to missing data.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a late-fusion multimodal ensemble architecture. It integrates predictions from two specialized models: a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for processing physiological time-series data (vitals) and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for analyzing unstructured clinical notes. A logistic regression model then combines the outputs of these two modality-specific models. The system is designed for robustness, featuring a calibrated fallback mechanism when one of the data modalities is unavailable.</p>

The system consistently maintains well-calibrated predictions and robust operation, including a calibrated fallback for missing data. A key finding is its multilevel interpretability, providing insights into feature contributions within modalities and direct per-case attributions detailing how vitals and notes collectively influence each prediction.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.</p>
