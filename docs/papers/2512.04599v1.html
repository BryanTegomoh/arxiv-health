                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously detects, identifies, and pixel-accurately localizes malicious content within images in a single pass. By fusing foundation segmentation models (SAM) with vision-language models (VLM) and incorporating an ensemble strategy, the method achieves high recall and precision on a new dataset, demonstrating robust performance against adversarial attacks and offering a practical, explainable solution for fine-grained content moderation.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core pipeline first employs a foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate initial object masks, which are then refined into distinct, larger regions. A vision-language model (VLM) is subsequently used to score the malicious relevance of each refined region via open-vocabulary prompts.

The entire process is hardened against attacks by ensembling predictions from multiple segmenters to improve reliability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Detecting illicit visual content demands more than image-level NSFW flags; moderators must also know what objects make an image illegal and where those objects occur. We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks. The full pipeline processes an image in seconds, plugs seamlessly into existing VLM workflows, and constitutes the first practical tool for fine-grained, explainable malicious-image moderation.</p>
