                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously detects, identifies, and localizes harmful content within images, providing pixel-accurate masks for critical elements, moving beyond simple image-level NSFW flags. Evaluated on a diverse dataset of drug, sexual, violent, and extremist content, the method achieves high recall (85.8%) and precision (78.1%), demonstrating significant improvement over direct VLM localization and robust performance against adversarial attacks, presenting a practical and explainable solution for content moderation.</p>

                    <p>The pipeline initiates with a foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks, which are then refined into larger, independent regions.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This tool offers a practical, rapid, and explainable solution for precisely identifying and localizing harmful visual content online. Its deployment can significantly strengthen public health initiatives by enabling social media platforms and digital health providers to more effectively detect and remove content promoting illegal drug sales, violence, or extremist ideologies. This enhanced moderation capability can contribute to safer online environments, protect vulnerable individuals from exposure to detrimental content, and ultimately support improved mental and physical well-being across populations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Detecting illicit visual content demands more than image-level NSFW flags; moderators must also know what objects make an image illegal and where those objects occur. We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks. The full pipeline processes an image in seconds, plugs seamlessly into existing VLM workflows, and constitutes the first practical tool for fine-grained, explainable malicious-image moderation.</p>
