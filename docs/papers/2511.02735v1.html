                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a novel framework combining eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to identify stable, task-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) for P300 classification. The method effectively probes deeper cortical-subcortical structures relevant to Alzheimer's disease, significantly enhancing single-trial P300 classification accuracy by up to 5.4% compared to whole-brain approaches, while maintaining millisecond temporal precision. The framework's robustness and portability offer significant potential for early neurodegenerative disease detection.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) frequently face spatial
specificity limitations in detecting single-trial P300 potentials, a
neurophysiological hallmark leveraged for both BCI control and
neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. We present a novel framework combining
eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to
identify stable regions of interest (ROIs) across sessions. Analyzing
62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we
demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate
task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula
and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. By
integrating spatially stable ROIs with dynamic temporal agreement, our hybrid
classification systematically outperforms whole-brain approaches in different
frequency bands (up to 5.4% depending on the connectivity method and the
spectral range) while maintaining millisecond-level temporal precision.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish
cross-subject ROI consensus through source-space connectivity, bypassing scalp
EEG's depth constraints to probe Alzheimer's-relevant networks. The framework's
robustness to noise and compatibility with portable systems offer significant
potential for global deployment in early neurodegenerative disease detection.
Future integration of individualized anatomical data or adaptive parameter
optimization could refine this tool for clinical deployment, enhancing the
current max accuracy of 81.57% in the 1-15 Hz range.</p>
