                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel framework that combines eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to overcome spatial specificity limitations in single-trial P300 classification for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). The method reliably identifies stable, task-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) in deeper cortical-subcortical structures, such as the insula and parietal regions, crucial for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and demonstrates improved classification accuracy compared to whole-brain approaches.</p>

                    <p>The study employs a novel framework involving eLORETA source localization to project scalp EEG data into source space.

These spatially stable ROIs are subsequently integrated into a hybrid classification framework that also considers dynamic temporal agreement for single-trial P300 detection, comparing its performance against whole-brain approaches using data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials).</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) frequently face spatial
specificity limitations in detecting single-trial P300 potentials, a
neurophysiological hallmark leveraged for both BCI control and
neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. We present a novel framework combining
eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to
identify stable regions of interest (ROIs) across sessions. Analyzing
62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we
demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate
task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula
and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. By
integrating spatially stable ROIs with dynamic temporal agreement, our hybrid
classification systematically outperforms whole-brain approaches in different
frequency bands (up to 5.4% depending on the connectivity method and the
spectral range) while maintaining millisecond-level temporal precision.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish
cross-subject ROI consensus through source-space connectivity, bypassing scalp
EEG's depth constraints to probe Alzheimer's-relevant networks. The framework's
robustness to noise and compatibility with portable systems offer significant
potential for global deployment in early neurodegenerative disease detection.
Future integration of individualized anatomical data or adaptive parameter
optimization could refine this tool for clinical deployment, enhancing the
current max accuracy of 81.57% in the 1-15 Hz range.</p>
