                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>OEMA employs a multi-agent collaboration framework. A 'self-annotator' agent first generates candidate entity examples. These examples are then rigorously filtered by a 'discriminator' agent that leverages the SNOMED CT clinical ontology to ensure accuracy and clinical relevance. Finally, a 'predictor' agent performs the actual named entity recognition inference using refined entity descriptions. This zero-shot approach minimizes the need for labeled training data while maximizing accuracy through ontology-enhanced filtering and multi-agent synergy.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Clinical named entity recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting information from electronic health records (EHRs), but supervised models like CRF and BioClinicalBERT require costly annotated data. While zero-shot NER with large language models (LLMs) reduces this dependency, it struggles with example selection granularity and integrating prompts with self-improvement. To address this, we propose OEMA, a zero-shot clinical NER framework using multi-agent collaboration. OEMA's three components are: a self-annotator generating examples, a discriminator filtering them via SNOMED CT, and a predictor using entity descriptions for accurate inference. On MTSamples and VAERS datasets, OEMA achieves state-of-the-art exact-match performance. Under related-match, it matches supervised BioClinicalBERT and surpasses CRF. OEMA addresses key zero-shot NER challenges through ontology-guided reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, achieving near-supervised performance and showing promise for clinical NLP applications.</p>
