                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SciTrust 2.0, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific applications across four key dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness, scientific safety, and scientific ethics. The evaluation of seven prominent LLMs revealed that general-purpose industry models significantly outperformed science-specialized models, which exhibited critical deficiencies in logical reasoning, ethical understanding, and safety, particularly in high-risk scientific domains like biosecurity.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>The findings are highly relevant to medicine as LLMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical and biomedical research settings. The identified trustworthiness gaps, especially in science-specialized models regarding truthfulness, safety (e.g., biosecurity concerns), and ethics, could lead to erroneous diagnoses, unsafe treatment recommendations, or unethical research proposals, directly impacting patient safety and public health.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper provides a framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific applications. This is critical for the safe and ethical deployment of medical AI applications across various domains, including drug discovery, genomics, diagnostic support, and medical literature synthesis. The identified vulnerabilities of LLMs in high-risk areas like biosecurity directly impact the reliability and safety considerations for any AI system used in medical or public health contexts, especially where biological agents, chemicals, or sensitive research are involved. The framework's focus on safety and ethics directly informs the development of trustworthy AI for health and medicine.</p>

                <p>The findings underscore the critical need for rigorous trustworthiness evaluation of LLMs, particularly those marketed as 'science-specialized,' before their integration into medical applications. Unaddressed deficiencies in safety, ethics, and truthfulness could lead to severe consequences in clinical decision-making, drug development, or public health interventions, necessitating careful validation and potentially favoring robust general-purpose models for sensitive tasks, or significant improvements in specialized models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.</p>
