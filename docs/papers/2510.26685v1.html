                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: The rapid evolution of personalized neoantigen vaccines has been
accelerated by artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models. Yet, a
consistent framework to evaluate the translational fidelity between
computational predictions and clinical outcomes remains lacking. Methods: This
systematic synthesis analyzed six melanoma vaccine trials conducted between
2017 and 2025 across mRNA, peptide, and dendritic cell platforms. We introduced
the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) metric - a quantitative measure
linking model performance (AUC) with clinical efficacy (HR/ORR) - and
integrated mechanistic, economic, and regulatory perspectives. Results:
Simulated AOC values across studies ranged from 0.42-0.79, suggesting
heterogeneous concordance between algorithmic prediction and observed outcomes.
High tumor mutational burden and clonal neoantigen dominance correlated with
improved translational fidelity. Economic modeling suggested that achieving AOC
>0.7 could reduce ICER below $100,000/QALY. Conclusions: This framework
quantitatively bridges AI-driven neoantigen prediction with clinical
translation, offering a reproducible metric for future personalized vaccine
validation and regulatory standardization. This study presents AOC as a
hypothesis-generating tool, with all computations based on simulated or
aggregated trial data for demonstration purposes only.</p>
