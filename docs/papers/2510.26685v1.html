                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) metric, a quantitative framework to assess the translational fidelity between AI-based neoantigen prediction models and clinical outcomes in personalized cancer vaccines. Using simulated data from melanoma vaccine trials, the study found heterogeneous AOC values (0.42-0.79) and correlations with tumor mutational burden, suggesting that an AOC > 0.7 could significantly improve cost-effectiveness.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved a systematic synthesis of six simulated melanoma vaccine trials conducted between 2017 and 2025, covering mRNA, peptide, and dendritic cell platforms. It introduced the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) metric, defined as a quantitative link between AI model performance (AUC) and clinical efficacy (HR/ORR). The methodology also incorporated mechanistic, economic (ICER/QALY modeling), and regulatory perspectives, with all computations and findings derived from simulated or aggregated trial data.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The proposed AOC metric, when applied to simulated data, demonstrated a range of 0.42-0.79, indicating variable translational fidelity of AI predictions. Higher AOC values were positively correlated with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) and clonal neoantigen dominance. Crucially, economic modeling suggested that achieving an AOC greater than 0.7 could reduce the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) to below $100,000/QALY, indicating a threshold for economic viability.</p>

                <p>The AOC framework provides a much-needed reproducible metric for validating AI-driven personalized neoantigen vaccines, potentially streamlining clinical trial design and regulatory pathways. By identifying factors that improve AI-to-outcome concordance (e.g., TMB), it could guide patient selection and vaccine optimization strategies, ultimately leading to more effective and potentially cost-effective cancer immunotherapies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: The rapid evolution of personalized neoantigen vaccines has been
accelerated by artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models. Yet, a
consistent framework to evaluate the translational fidelity between
computational predictions and clinical outcomes remains lacking. Methods: This
systematic synthesis analyzed six melanoma vaccine trials conducted between
2017 and 2025 across mRNA, peptide, and dendritic cell platforms. We introduced
the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) metric - a quantitative measure
linking model performance (AUC) with clinical efficacy (HR/ORR) - and
integrated mechanistic, economic, and regulatory perspectives. Results:
Simulated AOC values across studies ranged from 0.42-0.79, suggesting
heterogeneous concordance between algorithmic prediction and observed outcomes.
High tumor mutational burden and clonal neoantigen dominance correlated with
improved translational fidelity. Economic modeling suggested that achieving AOC
>0.7 could reduce ICER below $100,000/QALY. Conclusions: This framework
quantitatively bridges AI-driven neoantigen prediction with clinical
translation, offering a reproducible metric for future personalized vaccine
validation and regulatory standardization. This study presents AOC as a
hypothesis-generating tool, with all computations based on simulated or
aggregated trial data for demonstration purposes only.</p>
