                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a weakly supervised dual-encoder model designed for detecting rare and diverse abnormal events within surveillance videos. The framework effectively combines convolutional and transformer representations using a top-k pooling mechanism, achieving a notable performance of 90.7% Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the UCF-Crime dataset.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This technology holds significant potential for enhancing patient safety and monitoring in healthcare settings by automating the detection of critical abnormal events, such as falls, seizures, or agitated behavior, in real-time surveillance videos.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application would involve automated video analytics systems deployed in healthcare environments to continuously monitor surveillance feeds. These systems could detect critical abnormal events such as patient falls, aggressive behavior among patients or towards staff, unauthorized entry into restricted areas (e.g., pharmacies, operating rooms, high-security labs for biosecurity), patient wandering or elopement, and other security or safety incidents, providing real-time alerts to healthcare staff or security personnel.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology centers on a weakly supervised dual-backbone framework. This framework integrates feature representations derived from both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models. These combined representations are then processed through a top-k pooling mechanism to effectively identify and localize abnormal events within surveillance video streams.</p>

                <p>This research could lead to the development of automated monitoring systems in clinical environments (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities) that provide early warnings for patient distress, falls, or other critical abnormal behaviors. This capability could reduce caregiver workload, improve response times to emergencies, and proactively enhance the safety and well-being of vulnerable patients.</p>
