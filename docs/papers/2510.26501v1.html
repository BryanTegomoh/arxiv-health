                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes utilizing lightweight Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) filters as an upstream mechanism to enhance the robustness and safety of deep learning models for ECG classification on wearables. By effectively identifying Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data like unseen pathologies or noise-corrupted signals, these filters prevent erroneous high-confidence predictions. Integrating an optimized Deep SVDD filter improved diagnostic classifier accuracy by up to 21 percentage points in simulated deployments, making continuous cardiovascular monitoring more reliable.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.</p>
