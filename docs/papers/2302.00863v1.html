                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper advocates for the urgent creation of a global early warning system (EWS) for pandemics, citing lessons from COVID-19, the concerning dismantling of monitoring programs, and the exacerbating role of climate change on infectious diseases. It proposes an EWS that integrates diverse data sources (genomics, climate, social dynamics, healthcare infrastructure) with community-driven modeling and advanced AI to enable precision disease detection and accelerate science-informed public health policies globally. The authors illustrate the potential through the example of dengue fever in Brazil, framing such a system as intrinsic to sustainable development.</p>

It does not explicitly detail limitations of the proposed system's implementation, such as challenges with data standardization, privacy concerns for integrated global data, or the governance complexities of a truly global, interconnected system.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that global health, social systems, and economies can be surprisingly fragile in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. Yet, during the last half of 2022, and quite remarkably, we began dismantling essential infectious disease monitoring programs in several countries. Absent such programs, localized biological risks will transform into global shocks linked directly to our lack of foresight regarding emerging health risks. Additionally, recent studies indicate that more than half of all infectious diseases could be made worse by climate change, complicating pandemic containment. Despite this complexity, the factors leading to pandemics are largely predictable but can only be realized through a well-designed global early warning system. Such a system should integrate data from genomics, climate and environment, social dynamics, and healthcare infrastructure. The glue for such a system is community-driven modeling, a modern logistics of data, and democratization of AI tools. Using the example of dengue fever in Brazil, we can demonstrate how thoughtfully designed technology platforms can build global-scale precision disease detection and response systems that significantly reduce exposure to systemic shocks, accelerate science-informed public health policies, and deliver reliable healthcare and economic opportunities as an intrinsic part of the global sustainable development agenda.</p>
