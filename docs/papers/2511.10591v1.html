                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents two complementary AI approaches for the MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task, focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. The first method, mined prompting, enhances response relevance by leveraging few-shot examples from similar training data. The second, metadata-guided generation, refines clinical precision by incorporating dynamically predicted metadata attributes, collectively offering promising directions for efficient and reliable wound care support.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.</p>
