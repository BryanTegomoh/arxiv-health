                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper pioneers the systematic evaluation of Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) as a synthetic, label-rich training domain for machine learning models to detect Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC) from chest X-ray-like images. The study demonstrates that lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks, when optimized with super-resolution, contrast enhancement, and curriculum learning, achieve a mean AUC of 0.754, establishing DRRs as a scalable foundation for CAC detection competitive with or exceeding prior real CXR-based methods.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper describes the application of machine learning (specifically CNNs) for automated detection of Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC) from chest X-rays. It innovatively uses synthetic chest X-rays (Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs - DRRs) derived from CT scans to create a label-rich training environment, addressing a major challenge in medical AI development (lack of ground truth labels for real CXRs). The ultimate goal is to facilitate scalable, inexpensive screening for CAC, thereby improving early detection of cardiovascular disease risk.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.</p>
