                    <p>ProGiDiff adapts a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for medical image segmentation by integrating a novel ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism. This mechanism includes a custom encoder specifically designed for image conditioning, which effectively steers the diffusion model.

                <p>The proposed ProGiDiff framework has the potential to significantly enhance clinical practice by providing a highly flexible and interactive tool for medical image segmentation. Prompt-guided multi-class segmentation can accelerate and standardize tasks in diagnosis and treatment planning (e.g., radiation therapy planning, surgical navigation).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.</p>
