                    <p>ProGiDiff leverages a pre-trained diffusion model, originally for text-to-image generation, by introducing a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder. This encoder is specifically designed for image conditioning, steering the diffusion process to output segmentation masks.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>ProGiDiff has the potential to significantly improve clinical practice by enabling more interactive and precise medical image segmentation. Its ability to generate multiple proposals allows clinicians to consider various interpretations, enhancing diagnostic confidence and potentially reducing errors. The cross-modality adaptability with minimal training data reduces the barrier for deploying segmentation models across different scanner types and imaging sequences, improving efficiency. Furthermore, natural language prompting simplifies user interaction, making the technology more accessible and integrated into clinical workflows, particularly in an 'expert-in-the-loop' setting.</p>

However, it implies that the full benefit of the method is realized with an 'expert-in-the-loop' setting, suggesting that fully automated, unassisted performance might still benefit from human oversight or refinement.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.</p>
