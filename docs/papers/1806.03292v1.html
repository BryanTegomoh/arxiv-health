Understanding conditions for multiple endemic equilibria or absence of backward bifurcation, especially concerning permanent immunity, allows policymakers to anticipate long-term disease prevalence and optimize resource allocation for sustained control or elimination efforts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Public health services are constantly searching for new ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as public vaccination of asymptomatic individuals, quarantine (isolation) and treatment of symptomatic individuals. Epidemic models have a long history of assisting in public health planning and policy making. In this paper, we introduce epidemic models including variable population size, degree-related imperfect vaccination and quarantine on scale-free networks. More specifically, the models are formulated both on the population with and without permanent natural immunity to infection, which corresponds respectively to the susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined-recovered (SVIQR) model and the susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined (SVIQS) model. We develop different mathematical methods and techniques to study the dynamics of two models, including the basic reproduction number, the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. For the SVIQR model, we show that the system exhibits a forward bifurcation. Meanwhile, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are shown to be globally asymptotically stable by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. For the SVIQS model, conditions ensuring the occurrence of multiple endemic equilibria are derived. Under certain conditions, this system cannot undergo a backward bifurcation. The global asymptotical stability of disease-free equilibrium, and the persistence of the disease are proved. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be globally attractive by using monotone iterative technique. Finally, stochastic network simulations yield quantitative agreement with the deterministic mean-field approach.</p>
