                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces and rigorously analyzes novel epidemic models, SVIQR (with permanent immunity) and SVIQS (without permanent immunity), incorporating variable population size, degree-related imperfect vaccination, and quarantine strategies on scale-free networks. The research details the global stability properties of disease-free and endemic equilibria, basic reproduction number, and bifurcation behaviors for both models, providing critical insights for public health planning.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The SVIQR model (with permanent immunity) exhibits a forward bifurcation where the disease-free and a unique endemic equilibrium are globally asymptotically stable. The SVIQS model (without permanent immunity) shows the possibility of multiple endemic equilibria under specific conditions and does not undergo a backward bifurcation under certain criteria. For SVIQS, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, disease persistence is demonstrated, and the endemic equilibrium is globally attractive. Importantly, the deterministic mean-field results were consistently corroborated by stochastic network simulations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research offers a robust theoretical basis for optimizing public health interventions. It enables the prediction of disease outcomes (elimination vs. persistence, potential for multiple endemic states) under varying vaccination coverages and efficacies, and quarantine adherence, particularly considering the heterogeneous contact patterns found in real populations. This can guide resource allocation, inform vaccine rollout strategies (e.g., targeting high-degree individuals), and enhance preparedness for future outbreaks by providing a quantitative understanding of intervention effectiveness.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Public health services are constantly searching for new ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as public vaccination of asymptomatic individuals, quarantine (isolation) and treatment of symptomatic individuals. Epidemic models have a long history of assisting in public health planning and policy making. In this paper, we introduce epidemic models including variable population size, degree-related imperfect vaccination and quarantine on scale-free networks. More specifically, the models are formulated both on the population with and without permanent natural immunity to infection, which corresponds respectively to the susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined-recovered (SVIQR) model and the susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined (SVIQS) model. We develop different mathematical methods and techniques to study the dynamics of two models, including the basic reproduction number, the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. For the SVIQR model, we show that the system exhibits a forward bifurcation. Meanwhile, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are shown to be globally asymptotically stable by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. For the SVIQS model, conditions ensuring the occurrence of multiple endemic equilibria are derived. Under certain conditions, this system cannot undergo a backward bifurcation. The global asymptotical stability of disease-free equilibrium, and the persistence of the disease are proved. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be globally attractive by using monotone iterative technique. Finally, stochastic network simulations yield quantitative agreement with the deterministic mean-field approach.</p>
