                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper challenges the conventional reliance on Word Error Rate (WER) for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in clinical dialogue, demonstrating its poor correlation with the actual clinical impact of transcription errors. To address this, the authors introduce and validate an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, optimized using GEPA through DSPy, which accurately replicates expert clinical assessment of ASR error severity, providing a scalable method for safety-focused evaluation.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved creating a gold-standard benchmark where expert clinicians manually compared ground-truth patient-doctor dialogues with ASR-generated transcripts, assigning a clinical impact label (No, Minimal, Significant) to any observed discrepancies. Subsequently, the correlation between these labels and various ASR evaluation metrics (including WER) was assessed. Finally, an LLM (Gemini-2.5-Pro) was fine-tuned and optimized using the GEPA method via DSPy to function as an 'LLM-as-a-Judge,' replicating the expert clinical assessment, and its performance was validated against human expert judgments using accuracy and Cohen's kappa.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that traditional ASR metrics like WER exhibit poor correlation with the actual clinical impact of transcription errors, rendering them inadequate for assessing ASR safety in healthcare. Crucially, an LLM-as-a-Judge, specifically Gemini-2.5-Pro optimized through GEPA/DSPy, achieved a high degree of concordance with human expert clinicians (90% accuracy, κ=0.816), proving its capability to reliably assess the clinical impact of ASR errors.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research has significant clinical impact by enabling the development and deployment of ASR systems that are truly safe and reliable for clinical use. It offers an automated, scalable method to evaluate ASR fidelity in terms of patient safety, moving beyond mere textual accuracy. This can lead to more trustworthy electronic health records, reduce the risk of clinical errors due to ASR misinterpretations, and ultimately improve the quality and safety of patient care delivered via technology-assisted dialogue.</p>

                <p>The primary future direction is the widespread adoption and further refinement of this validated, automated framework for ASR evaluation in clinical settings. This includes applying it to a broader range of ASR technologies and clinical scenarios, integrating it into ASR development pipelines, and potentially using it to drive improvements in ASR models themselves, optimizing them directly for clinical safety rather than just WER.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA through DSPy to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.</p>
