                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ePAI, an artificial intelligence system designed for the early and prediagnostic detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from computed tomography (CT) scans. ePAI demonstrated robust performance across internal and external validation sets, significantly outperforming human radiologists by identifying subtle PDAC lesions months to years before clinical diagnosis and initial radiologist oversight.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Pancreatic cancer's high mortality rate is primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. This AI system offers a critical breakthrough by enabling the detection of PDAC significantly earlier, potentially transforming the disease's prognosis and enabling curative interventions, thereby improving patient survival rates.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application, ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence), is designed as an assistive tool to improve the early and prediagnostic detection of pancreatic cancer from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. It automatically identifies and localizes small pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), even those previously overlooked by expert radiologists, offering a significant lead time before clinical diagnosis. This application directly aids medical professionals in screening and diagnosis, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved survival rates for patients.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is frequently detected at late, inoperable stages, with expert retrospective review often revealing overlooked lesions on prior CT scans.</li>

                    <li>In an internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved high performance: AUC of 0.939-0.999, sensitivity of 95.3%, and specificity of 98.7% for PDACs less than 2 cm, precisely localizing lesions as small as 2 mm.</li>

                    <li>Crucially, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis, which had been originally overlooked by radiologists, providing a median lead time of 347 days for 75 of 159 patients.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved developing ePAI, an AI-based system, likely utilizing deep learning models, trained on CT scan data from 1,598 patients. Its performance was evaluated through a multi-stage validation process: an internal test (1,009 patients), an external validation across 6 distinct medical centers (7,158 patients), and a comparative multi-reader study where ePAI's performance was measured against 30 board-certified radiologists on prediagnostic CTs. Key metrics included Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and the system's ability to localize small lesions and provide diagnostic lead time.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>ePAI demonstrated consistently high diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.939-0.999 (internal) and 0.918-0.945 (external), with sensitivities ranging from 91.5% to 95.3% and specificities from 88.0% to 98.7%. It precisely localized PDACs as small as 2-5 mm. Critically, ePAI successfully detected previously overlooked PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans, providing a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis in a significant proportion of patients (75 out of 159). Moreover, ePAI significantly surpassed 30 radiologists in sensitivity by 50.3% (P < 0.05) for early and prediagnostic detection, while maintaining comparable specificity (95.4%).</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>ePAI holds substantial potential to revolutionize the clinical management of pancreatic cancer. By serving as an assistive tool for radiologists, it can enhance the early identification of subtle, prediagnostic lesions, leading to earlier patient referral, timely diagnostic workup, and interventions at potentially curable stages. This could significantly improve surgical resectability rates, reduce advanced-stage diagnoses, and ultimately extend the survival and improve the quality of life for PDAC patients.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>While robust external validation was performed, the initial training data for ePAI was sourced from a single medical center, which might introduce some bias, though mitigated by multi-center testing. The abstract does not provide details on specific limitations regarding CT scanner variability, patient demographics in the broader population, or the potential for increased false positives that could lead to unnecessary follow-up procedures and associated patient anxiety or costs.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The findings suggest a clear path towards the clinical integration of ePAI as an assistive tool. Future research should focus on prospective validation in real-world clinical settings, evaluating its impact on patient outcomes, assessing its cost-effectiveness, and exploring its generalizability across diverse patient populations and healthcare infrastructures.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.</p>
