                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ePAI, an artificial intelligence system designed for the early and prediagnostic detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from computed tomography (CT) scans. ePAI demonstrated high accuracy and sensitivity in both internal and external validations, crucially detecting lesions up to 36 months before clinical diagnosis, often overlooked by radiologists. A multi-reader study confirmed ePAI's significant outperformance of board-certified radiologists in sensitivity for early PDAC detection.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Early detection is critical for improving the grim prognosis of PDAC, as timely diagnosis allows for potentially curative surgical resection. This AI system could transform PDAC management by identifying cancer at a stage when intervention is still possible, significantly impacting patient survival rates.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application, ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence), is designed as an assistive tool for radiologists to automatically and accurately detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from CT scans. It aims to identify small, previously overlooked lesions at a prediagnostic stage, potentially months before clinical diagnosis, thereby improving the chances for earlier intervention and better patient prognoses for one of the deadliest malignancies.</p>

                    <p>The study involved developing and training a deep learning-based artificial intelligence system, ePAI, using CT scan data.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>ePAI demonstrated superior performance in detecting small PDACs (<2cm) with internal test metrics of AUC 0.939-0.999, sensitivity 95.3%, and specificity 98.7%, localizing lesions down to 2 mm. External validation confirmed robustness with AUC 0.918-0.945, sensitivity 91.5%, and specificity 88.0%, localizing 5 mm lesions. Crucially, ePAI achieved prediagnostic detection in 75 of 159 patients with a median lead time of 347 days (3-36 months prior) and significantly outperformed radiologists by 50.3% in sensitivity (P < 0.05) at comparable specificity (95.4%).</p>

                <p>ePAI has the potential to serve as a vital assistive tool for radiologists, significantly enhancing the early detection of pancreatic cancer. By identifying PDAC at an earlier, potentially resectable stage, it could substantially improve patient outcomes and survival rates, shifting the paradigm from late-stage palliative care to curative intervention.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.</p>
