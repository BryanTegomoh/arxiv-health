                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ePAI, an Artificial Intelligence system designed for early and prediagnostic detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from computed tomography (CT) scans. The system demonstrated high accuracy in both internal and external validation sets, detecting subtle, overlooked lesions up to 36 months before clinical diagnosis. Notably, ePAI significantly outperformed expert radiologists in sensitivity for identifying early PDACs.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a devastating cancer primarily because it is often diagnosed too late for curative intervention. By enabling early and prediagnostic detection of small lesions, ePAI could fundamentally shift the treatment paradigm, allowing for earlier surgical resection and therapy, thereby significantly improving patient prognosis and survival rates.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is 'ePAI', an automated system developed using Artificial Intelligence to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) on Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Its primary application is to serve as an assistive tool for radiologists, improving the sensitivity and lead time for early, prediagnostic detection of pancreatic cancer, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially improving patient prognosis.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved developing ePAI, an automated AI system, trained on CT scan data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. The system's performance was rigorously evaluated in an internal test set of 1,009 patients and externally validated using data from 7,158 patients across 6 distinct medical centers. A critical component of the methodology included assessing ePAI's ability to identify PDACs on retrospective prediagnostic CT scans that had been overlooked by radiologists. Furthermore, a multi-reader study directly compared ePAI's diagnostic accuracy against 30 board-certified radiologists.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>ePAI consistently demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.939-0.999 internally (sensitivity 95.3%, specificity 98.7% for PDAC <2cm) and 0.918-0.945 externally (sensitivity 91.5%, specificity 88.0%). It could precisely localize PDACs as small as 2mm internally and 5mm externally. Crucially, ePAI successfully detected previously overlooked PDACs in 75 out of 159 prediagnostic CT scans, providing a median lead time of 347 days (up to 36 months) before clinical diagnosis. In a direct comparison, ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists in sensitivity by 50.3% (P < 0.05) for early/prediagnostic detection while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4%.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The clinical impact of ePAI could be transformative for pancreatic cancer management. By offering an assistive tool that significantly improves the early and prediagnostic detection of PDACs, ePAI has the potential to facilitate timely surgical interventions and therapies. This could lead to a substantial increase in the proportion of patients diagnosed at an operable stage, thereby directly improving long-term survival rates for a disease that currently has a very poor prognosis. It could serve as a valuable second-reader tool to augment radiologists' capabilities and reduce diagnostic oversights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.</p>
