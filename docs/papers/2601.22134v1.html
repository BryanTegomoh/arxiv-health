                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces ePAI, an AI system for early and prediagnostic detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from computed tomography (CT) scans. ePAI demonstrated high performance in both internal (AUC 0.939-0.999, sensitivity 95.3%, specificity 98.7%) and external validation cohorts, accurately localizing PDACs as small as 2mm. Crucially, it detected previously overlooked PDACs 3-36 months before clinical diagnosis, significantly outperforming board-certified radiologists in sensitivity.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is frequently diagnosed at an advanced, inoperable stage, leading to extremely poor patient outcomes. This AI-driven approach offers the potential for significantly earlier detection, enabling timely surgical intervention and improving the chances of curative treatment and prolonged survival.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI system, ePAI, is designed to act as an assistive tool for radiologists to improve the early and prediagnostic detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from CT scans. It aims to overcome the limitation of human oversight by identifying subtle lesions indicative of PDAC months to years before clinical diagnosis, thereby potentially enabling earlier treatment and improving patient survival rates.</p>

                    <p>The study involved developing an automated AI system, ePAI, trained on CT data from 1,598 patients. Its performance was assessed through multi-phase validation: internal testing (1,009 patients), external testing across six different medical centers (7,158 patients), and a comparative multi-reader study where ePAI's performance was pitted against 30 board-certified radiologists. Evaluation metrics included Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and the capability for precise lesion localization and prediagnostic detection lead time.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.</p>
