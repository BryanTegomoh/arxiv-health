                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study evaluates and compares SARIMAX, XGBoost, and LSTM machine learning models for forecasting daily Emergency Department (ED) admissions over a seven-day horizon, using five years of data from an Australian hospital. It uniquely decomposes demand by ward category and clinical complexity, addressing COVID-19 data anomalies with counterfactual values. The models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline, with XGBoost being most accurate for total admissions and SARIMAX for major complexity cases, though all models struggle with sudden patient surges.</p>

                    <p>The study performed a retrospective analysis of daily ED arrival data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021. Patient demand was granularly analyzed by decomposing it into eight specific ward categories and stratifying by clinical complexity. To account for COVID-19 pandemic-induced data anomalies, the Prophet model was utilized to generate synthetic counterfactual values. Three predictive models—Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—were developed and evaluated for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon, with their performance compared against a seasonal naive baseline using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>All three machine learning models (SARIMAX, XGBoost, LSTM) consistently outperformed a seasonal naive baseline in predicting daily ED admissions. XGBoost demonstrated the highest overall accuracy for forecasting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.63. For more specific major complexity cases, the statistical SARIMAX model showed marginally superior performance with an MAE of 3.77. However, a shared limitation across all models was their inability to accurately predict sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume, despite successfully reproducing regular daily patterns.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The application of these forecasting models can significantly improve proactive resource management within hospitals, allowing for more precise allocation of staffing, beds, and equipment in Emergency Departments and receiving wards. This could lead to reduced ED overcrowding, shorter patient wait times, enhanced patient flow, and ultimately, improved quality and safety of care, particularly for patients with higher clinical complexity.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>A primary limitation identified is that while the predictive models effectively reproduce regular daily patient admission patterns, they commonly underestimate sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume, which are critical events impacting ED capacity and operational stability.</p>

                <p>Although not explicitly detailed, the identified limitation regarding the models' inability to predict sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume strongly implies that future research should focus on developing methodologies or incorporating additional real-time exogenous variables to better capture and forecast such critical, high-impact events.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Emergency Department overcrowding is a critical issue that compromises patient safety and operational efficiency, necessitating accurate demand forecasting for effective resource allocation. This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume.</p>
