                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI model, Physiological State Reconstruction (PSR), is designed to provide fast and reliable coagulation assessment by leveraging Thromboelastography (TEG) data. Its primary application is to drastically reduce the diagnostic time for coagulation traits from nearly an hour to a fraction of that, enabling earlier detection of risks and prompt remediation. This aims to improve patient outcomes by reducing mortality rates associated with delayed coagulation monitoring, while also tackling common challenges in medical AI such as data scarcity and patient variability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In an ideal medical environment, real-time coagulation monitoring can enable early detection and prompt remediation of risks. However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement. The delay might lead to elevated mortality rates. These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too. Drift-aware learning suggests a new future, with potential uses well be-yond thrombophilia discovery towards medical AI applica-tions with data scarcity.</p>
