                <p>Future research could involve expanding the dataset to include polymer-solvent pairs at physiological temperatures (e.g., 37°C) and varying pH, crucial for biological applications. Exploring the prediction of other critical properties beyond solubility, such as degradation rates or biocompatibility, using similar SMILES-based approaches, could further enhance its medical utility. Integrating more diverse experimental data and applying the framework directly to specific drug formulation or medical device challenges are also promising avenues.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding and predicting polymer solubility in various solvents is critical for applications ranging from recycling to pharmaceutical formulation. This work presents a deep learning framework that predicts polymer solubility, expressed as weight percent (wt%), directly from SMILES representations of both polymers and solvents. A dataset of 8,049 polymer solvent pairs at 25 deg C was constructed from calibrated molecular dynamics simulations (Zhou et al., 2023), and molecular descriptors and fingerprints were combined into a 2,394 feature representation per sample. A fully connected neural network with six hidden layers was trained using the Adam optimizer and evaluated using mean squared error loss, achieving strong agreement between predicted and actual solubility values. Generalizability was demonstrated using experimentally measured data from the Materials Genome Project, where the model maintained high accuracy on 25 unseen polymer solvent combinations. These findings highlight the viability of SMILES based machine learning models for scalable solubility prediction and high-throughput solvent screening, supporting applications in green chemistry, polymer processing, and materials design.</p>
