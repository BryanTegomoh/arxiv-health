                    <p>DeepPNI employs a deep learning-based regression architecture that integrates two distinct feature types. Structural features from protein-nucleic acid complexes are processed via an edge-aware Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN), while sequential features are extracted using the ESM-2 protein language model. These combined features are then fed into the model to predict mutation-induced binding free energy changes. The model was rigorously validated using five-fold cross-validation on a dataset of 1951 mutations, including both protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes, and also through external dataset validation and comparison with existing tools.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The interaction between proteins and nucleic acids is crucial for processes that sustain cellular function, including DNA maintenance and the regulation of gene expression and translation. Amino acid mutations in protein-nucleic acid complexes often lead to vital diseases. Experimental techniques have their own specific limitations in predicting mutational effects in protein-nucleic acid complexes. In this study, we compiled a large dataset of 1951 mutations including both protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes and integrated structural and sequential features to build a deep learning-based regression model named DeepPNI. This model estimates mutation-induced binding free energy changes in protein-nucleic acid complexes. The structural features are encoded via edge-aware RGCN and the sequential features are extracted using protein language model ESM-2. We have achieved a high average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.76 in the large dataset via five-fold cross-validation. Consistent performance across individual dataset of protein-DNA, protein-RNA complexes, and different experimental temperature split dataset make the model generalizable. Our model showed good performance in complex-based five-fold cross-validation, which proved its robustness. In addition, DeepPNI outperformed in external dataset validation, and comparison with existing tools</p>
