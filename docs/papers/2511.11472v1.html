                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces novel methods to quantify and improve adaptivity in conformal prediction, addressing limitations of existing evaluation techniques. It proposes a new binning strategy using input transformations and uniform-mass binning, along with two new metrics for adaptivity assessment. Furthermore, the authors develop a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that leverages group-conditional conformal prediction based on estimated difficulty, demonstrating superior performance on both image classification and a medical visual acuity prediction task.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Improving adaptivity in conformal prediction is highly relevant to medicine by providing more reliable and context-aware uncertainty quantification. In clinical settings, it ensures that AI models provide precise, small prediction sets for straightforward cases while offering larger, safer sets for ambiguous or difficult cases, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient safety.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The research develops an improved machine learning method (adaptive conformal prediction) that can be applied to medical tasks. Specifically, for visual acuity prediction, it means an AI system can generate more reliable and context-aware predictions. The system would provide a set of probable visual acuity values (instead of a single point estimate), with a guaranteed coverage, and the size of this prediction set would adapt to the difficulty of the individual case – providing tighter, more precise ranges for easier predictions and wider, more cautious ranges for difficult ones. This can aid clinicians by providing more robust and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostic tools.</p>

                <p>This research can significantly enhance the trustworthiness and utility of AI in healthcare.

This adaptive uncertainty reporting can guide clinicians in interpreting AI outputs, reducing misdiagnosis risks and optimizing resource allocation by prompting deeper investigation only when necessary, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient patient care.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.</p>
