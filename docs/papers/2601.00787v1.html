                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This pilot study demonstrates the successful adaptation of transformer-based NLP models across Canadian provincial cancer registries, specifically for classifying pathology reports into cancer/non-cancer and reportable/non-reportable categories. It shows that models pretrained in one jurisdiction can be effectively localized to another with modest fine-tuning, and a novel ensemble approach significantly reduces missed cancers, paving the way for a privacy-preserving, interoperable NLP infrastructure for pan-Canadian cancer surveillance.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is crucial for improving the efficiency and timeliness of cancer data collection and surveillance, which directly impacts public health. By automating the classification of pathology reports, it can reduce the burden on manual abstractors, accelerate the availability of crucial cancer statistics, and enable more timely epidemiological studies and resource allocation for cancer control programs.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper uses transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models (e.g., BCCRTron, GatorTron) to automate the classification of de-identified pathology reports for population-based cancer registries. Specifically, it performs 'cancer vs. non-cancer' and 'reportable vs. non-reportable' tasks, aiming to reduce manual abstraction efforts, improve data accuracy (e.g., reducing missed cancers), and enhance the timeliness of cancer data for surveillance and research. It also proposes a privacy-preserving workflow for sharing model weights to facilitate a pan-Canadian foundation model for cancer pathology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Population-based cancer registries depend on pathology reports as their primary diagnostic source, yet manual abstraction is resource-intensive and contributes to delays in cancer data. While transformer-based NLP systems have improved registry workflows, their ability to generalize across jurisdictions with differing reporting conventions remains poorly understood. We present the first cross-provincial evaluation of adapting BCCRTron, a domain-adapted transformer model developed at the British Columbia Cancer Registry, alongside GatorTron, a biomedical transformer model, for cancer surveillance in Canada. Our training dataset consisted of approximately 104,000 and 22,000 de-identified pathology reports from the Newfoundland & Labrador Cancer Registry (NLCR) for Tier 1 (cancer vs. non-cancer) and Tier 2 (reportable vs. non-reportable) tasks, respectively. Both models were fine-tuned using complementary synoptic and diagnosis focused report section input pipelines. Across NLCR test sets, the adapted models maintained high performance, demonstrating transformers pretrained in one jurisdiction can be localized to another with modest fine-tuning. To improve sensitivity, we combined the two models using a conservative OR-ensemble achieving a Tier 1 recall of 0.99 and reduced missed cancers to 24, compared with 48 and 54 for the standalone models. For Tier 2, the ensemble achieved 0.99 recall and reduced missed reportable cancers to 33, compared with 54 and 46 for the individual models. These findings demonstrate that an ensemble combining complementary text representations substantially reduce missed cancers and improve error coverage in cancer-registry NLP. We implement a privacy-preserving workflow in which only model weights are shared between provinces, supporting interoperable NLP infrastructure and a future pan-Canadian foundation model for cancer pathology and registry workflows.</p>
