                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SoftMol, a novel unified framework designed to overcome limitations in existing GPT-based molecular language models (MLMs) for *de novo* molecular design. SoftMol addresses the inadequate capture of graph-structured molecules and the lack of target-aware generation by proposing a block-diffusion model, SoftBD, using 'soft fragments' and a gated Monte Carlo tree search. The framework achieves superior chemical validity, improved binding affinity, higher molecular diversity, and significantly faster inference compared to state-of-the-art models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Drug discovery can be viewed as a combinatorial search over an immense chemical space, motivating the development of deep generative models for de novo molecular design. Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.
