                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the underexplored performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rare disease diagnosis from narrative medical cases. It introduces a novel, educationally validated dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs derived from House M.D. and evaluates four state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing low initial accuracy (16.48% to 38.64%) but a significant 2.3 times improvement in newer model generations, establishing a crucial baseline for future AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The LLMs demonstrated significant variation in diagnostic accuracy for rare diseases, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64%. Despite these low overall scores, newer model generations exhibited a substantial 2.3-fold improvement in performance compared to their predecessors. All evaluated models, however, still face considerable challenges in accurately diagnosing rare conditions from narrative medical inputs.</p>

                <p>This research provides a foundational benchmark for the current capabilities and limitations of AI in a critically difficult area of clinical medicine. While current LLM performance is not yet suitable for direct clinical application in rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvements suggest a potential future role for AI as a diagnostic aid, particularly in supporting clinicians in complex, undifferentiated cases, guiding further development toward practical clinical tools.</p>

                <p>The primary limitation noted is the universally low accuracy of all evaluated LLMs (16.48% to 38.64%), indicating they currently face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis. The dataset size of 176 cases, while novel, might also be considered relatively small for comprehensive LLM training or evaluation, though not explicitly stated as a limitation in the abstract.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across diverse domains, yet their performance on rare disease diagnosis from narrative medical cases remains underexplored. We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p>
