                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">PrIntMesh is a novel template-based, topology-preserving deep learning framework designed to reconstruct organs as unified systems, addressing the issue of anatomically implausible reconstructions from independently processed substructures. It achieves high geometric accuracy and structural consistency by jointly deforming all substructures from a connected template, explicitly preserving internal boundaries, and enforcing smooth surfaces, demonstrating robust performance even with limited or noisy data. This approach offers a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use, outperforming traditional methods in maintaining anatomical plausibility.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>PrIntMesh is a template-based, topology-preserving deep learning framework. It initiates reconstruction from a pre-defined connected 3D template that encapsulates the organ and its internal substructures. The core process involves jointly deforming all substructures of this template to accurately align with patient-specific anatomical data. Critical aspects of the methodology include explicitly preserving the internal boundaries between these interconnected substructures and enforcing the generation of smooth, artifact-free surface meshes for the entire reconstructed organ.</p>

                    <p>The framework successfully achieves high geometric accuracy in organ reconstruction and maintains correct topology for both the overall organ and its constituent substructures. It demonstrates robust performance, even when challenged with limited or noisy training data, underscoring its data-efficient nature. Crucially, PrIntMesh significantly improves the reconstruction of shared interfaces between substructures and preserves structural consistency more effectively compared to conventional voxel-based and surface-based methods.</p>

                <p>PrIntMesh's ability to generate anatomically plausible, precise, and structurally consistent 3D organ models with explicit substructure relationships holds significant clinical impact. Its data efficiency makes it practical for integration into clinical workflows where extensive, perfectly curated datasets are often unavailable. This can lead to enhanced diagnostic precision, more reliable surgical planning, improved monitoring of disease progression, and facilitate the development of more effective personalized medical treatments.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.</p>
