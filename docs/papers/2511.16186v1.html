                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">PrIntMesh is a novel template-based, topology-preserving deep learning framework designed for 3D organ mesh reconstruction that treats organs as unified systems rather than independent parts. It jointly deforms all substructures from a connected template, explicitly preserving internal boundaries and ensuring smooth surfaces, leading to highly accurate, anatomically plausible, and robust reconstructions. The method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reconstructing shared interfaces, and is data-efficient for clinical use.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>PrIntMesh employs a deep learning architecture that initiates with a connected 3D mesh template representing the organ and its internal substructures. This template is then jointly deformed to align with patient-specific anatomical data, typically derived from medical images. A core aspect of the methodology is the explicit preservation of internal boundaries (interfaces between substructures) throughout the deformation process, along with mechanisms to enforce smooth, artifact-free external and internal surfaces of the reconstructed meshes.</p>

It demonstrates robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Crucially, it significantly improves the reconstruction of shared interfaces between substructures and maintains superior structural consistency compared to conventional voxel- and surface-based methods.</p>

                <p>By offering anatomically superior, plausible, and data-efficient 3D organ models, PrIntMesh can revolutionize diagnostic precision by providing more accurate representations of organ pathology. It can profoundly impact pre-surgical planning for complex procedures (e.g., cardiac surgeries, neurosurgeries), facilitate personalized treatment strategies, and aid in the development of more precise medical devices. Its robustness to data limitations is particularly beneficial for real-world clinical deployment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.</p>
