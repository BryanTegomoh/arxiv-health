                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents the most comprehensive expert evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in medicine, involving 18 medical experts and over 80,000 annotations. Contrary to expectations, standard RAG often degraded performance for medical queries, highlighting critical failure points in evidence retrieval and selection. However, the study also demonstrates that simple, targeted strategies like evidence filtering and query reformulation can substantially mitigate these issues, leading to significant performance improvements.</p>

It emphasizes the need for robust, meticulously designed RAG systems that prioritize high-quality retrieval and accurate evidence selection.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of medicine, yet
two fundamental challenges persist: keeping up with rapidly evolving medical
knowledge and providing verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these
limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However,
whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the
most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen
medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model
outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and
USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three
components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii)
evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation
(factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG
often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence
selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and
completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG
variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the
model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that
simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query
reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on
MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call
for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of
stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM
applications.</p>
