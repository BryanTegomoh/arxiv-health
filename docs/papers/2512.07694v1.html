                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces SafeTerm, a novel artificial intelligence system designed to automate the generation of custom MedDRA queries, which are critical for signal detection in pre-market drug safety review. SafeTerm achieves this by embedding medical terminology and MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) into a multidimensional vector space and using cosine similarity with extreme-value clustering to retrieve and rank relevant PTs. Validation against FDA OCMQ v3.0 demonstrated that the system can achieve high recall (>95%) at moderate thresholds and improved precision (up to 86%) at higher thresholds, making it a viable supplementary tool for pharmacovigilance.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The SafeTerm system leverages a quantitative artificial intelligence approach. It begins by embedding medical query terms and MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) into a multidimensional vector space. Subsequently, it utilizes cosine similarity to assess the semantic relatedness between the input query and the embedded PTs. An extreme-value clustering technique, combined with multi-criteria statistical methods, is then applied to generate and rank a list of relevant PTs. Validation was conducted against the FDA OCMQ v3.0 (104 queries) by computing precision, recall, and F1 scores across various similarity thresholds.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The system demonstrated high recall rates (>95%) at moderate similarity thresholds. Higher thresholds consistently improved precision, achieving up to 86%. The identified optimal similarity threshold range of 0.70-0.75 yielded a recall of approximately 50% and a precision of about 33%. Performance for narrow-term PT subsets was comparable, albeit requiring slightly higher similarity thresholds. Overall, SafeTerm is validated as a viable supplementary method for automated MedDRA query generation.</p>

                <p>SafeTerm has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and standardization of creating custom MedDRA queries, which are fundamental for identifying adverse drug reactions. By automating this process, it can accelerate signal detection during drug development and post-market surveillance, leading to earlier identification of potential safety issues and ultimately improving patient safety and regulatory compliance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">In pre-market drug safety review, grouping related adverse event terms into standardised MedDRA queries or the FDA Office of New Drugs Custom Medical Queries (OCMQs) is critical for signal detection. We present a novel quantitative artificial intelligence system that understands and processes medical terminology and automatically retrieves relevant MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) for a given input query, ranking them by a relevance score using multi-criteria statistical methods. The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against the FDA OCMQ v3.0 (104 queries), restricted to valid MedDRA PTs. Precision, recall and F1 were computed across similarity-thresholds. High recall (>95%) is achieved at moderate thresholds. Higher thresholds improve precision (up to 86%). The optimal threshold (~0.70 - 0.75) yielded recall ~50% and precision ~33%. Narrow-term PT subsets performed similarly but required slightly higher similarity thresholds. The SafeTerm AI-driven system provides a viable supplementary method for automated MedDRA query generation. A similarity threshold of ~0.60 is recommended initially, with increased thresholds for refined term selection.</p>
