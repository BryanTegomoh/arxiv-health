                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel class of multi-scale models for understanding the cellular dynamics underlying muscular dystrophies. It develops a framework that progresses from integro-differential equations for statistical cell distributions to mean-field Fokker-Planck equations, and subsequently to a macroscopic model for mean cell densities and their variances. The research identifies quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions as inverse Gamma distributions and proves long-time convergence to these states, offering new insights into the balance between muscle degeneration and regeneration.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While this paper itself does not employ AI methodologies, the mechanistic models developed here are highly relevant for future medical AI applications. For example: 1. **AI-driven Drug Discovery and Therapeutic Design**: The 'modeling of therapeutic interventions' could inform and be integrated into AI platforms for identifying potential drug targets, optimizing treatment strategies, or predicting patient responses. 2. **Personalized Medicine**: Understanding individual disease progression based on cell dynamics could contribute to AI models that personalize treatment plans. 3. **Data Generation/Feature Engineering**: The model could be used to generate synthetic data or mechanistic features to train and improve data-driven AI models for disease prognosis or treatment efficacy prediction. The deep understanding of underlying biological mechanisms provided by this modeling approach can complement and enhance purely data-driven AI methods in healthcare.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involves a multi-scale mathematical modeling approach. It starts with a system of integro-differential equations to represent the statistical distributions of muscle fiber and immune cell densities. This kinetic model is then scaled to derive a mean-field limit, resulting in a system of Fokker-Planck equations. Subsequently, a macroscopic model for mean cell densities and their variances is derived from the Fokker-Planck equations. Analytical techniques are employed to study long-time asymptotics, identifying quasi-equilibrium distributions, and numerical simulations are used to validate these analytical findings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present a new class of models for assessing the cell dynamics characterising muscular dystrophies. The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.</p>
