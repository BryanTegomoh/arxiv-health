                    <p>The study involved 23 older adults who completed three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests assessing working memory, processing speed, and attention.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the
cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild
dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive
screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief
snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by
continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether
physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive
tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23
older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess
working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a
wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature,
and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and
segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated
predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results:
Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean
absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean
predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement
and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin
conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with
skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These
findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised
learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive
functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study
demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This
approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.</p>
