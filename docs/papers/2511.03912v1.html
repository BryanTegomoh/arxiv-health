                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine as it tackles the critical challenge of detecting unknown or rare medical conditions in imaging diagnostics where labeled anomaly data is scarce and expert supervision is costly. By incrementally learning what constitutes 'normal' without explicit anomaly labels, it provides a scalable and robust method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, potentially identifying novel diseases or subtle variations that might otherwise be missed.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an unsupervised, incremental anomaly detection system for medical imaging. It aims to automatically identify pathological conditions or abnormalities in medical scans (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) without requiring extensive pre-labeled anomaly data. This can assist clinicians in diagnosing diseases like COVID-19, pneumonia, or neurological disorders more efficiently and accurately, especially in environments where expert labels are scarce, thereby improving diagnostic workflows and patient outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The proposed framework starts with a small, verified seed set of normal medical images. It alternates between updating lightweight convolutional adapters (attached to a frozen pretrained vision backbone) and admitting new, unlabeled samples into its 'normal' memory. Extracted image embeddings are stored in a compact coreset to facilitate efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) anomaly scoring. New samples are admitted only if they pass dual probabilistic safety gates: their distance to the existing coreset must be within a calibrated z-score threshold, and their epistemic uncertainty (estimated using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian, SWAG) must remain below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism ensures safe, oracle-free expansion without generative models or replay buffers.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework offers a significant potential clinical impact by enabling earlier and more accurate detection of unknown or emerging medical anomalies in imaging, even when labeled data is scarce. It could reduce the diagnostic burden on highly skilled radiologists, improve diagnostic consistency, and facilitate the deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools in resource-constrained or remote clinical settings. Its ability to adapt to new definitions of 'normality' without human intervention makes it valuable for dynamic healthcare environments, potentially speeding up the identification of novel disease patterns.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.</p>
