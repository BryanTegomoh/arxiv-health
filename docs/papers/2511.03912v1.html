                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces an unsupervised, oracle-free incremental learning framework for unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging, addressing the challenge of scarce labeled anomalies. The method iteratively expands a trusted set of normal samples by combining lightweight adapter updates with a dual probabilistic uncertainty-gated admission mechanism, utilizing a frozen pretrained backbone and a compact coreset for efficient k-NN scoring. This approach significantly improves anomaly detection performance across various medical imaging datasets, including COVID-CXR, Pneumonia CXR, and Brain MRI, by continually refining the notion of normality without relying on anomaly labels.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is an unsupervised, incremental anomaly detection system for medical images. It aims to assist healthcare professionals by automatically identifying deviations from normal patterns in X-rays (e.g., for COVID-19 or pneumonia) and MRIs (e.g., for brain anomalies), without requiring extensive labeled anomaly data. This can improve diagnostic efficiency, reduce reliance on costly expert supervision, and potentially lead to earlier or more accurate detection of diseases, particularly in settings with limited resources or for rare conditions.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This framework has significant potential for clinical application, enabling medical imaging systems to continuously learn and adapt to new presentations of 'normality' in an unsupervised manner. This capability facilitates the earlier detection of unknown pathologies, rare diseases, or emerging conditions (like new strains of viruses) that lack specific training data. It can reduce the diagnostic burden on expert radiologists, provide decision support in resource-limited settings, and accelerate the identification of critical anomalies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.</p>
