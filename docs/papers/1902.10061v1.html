                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the first supervised learning approach, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), for infectious disease outbreak detection using routinely collected public health surveillance data. The model significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods by reducing the false positive rate by up to 50% while maintaining equivalent sensitivity, as demonstrated with real Salmonella and Campylobacter data and simulations. This represents a crucial advancement in leveraging machine learning for more effective public health surveillance.</p>

                    <p>The study develops a novel supervised learning approach, specifically employing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), for disease outbreak detection. This method leverages historical, routinely collected surveillance data to train the model, allowing it to learn the patterns differentiating endemic levels from outbreak events. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated against a state-of-the-art statistical method using real-world *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* datasets, as well as synthetic data from simulations.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The supervised learning HMM-based model successfully reduced the false positive rate by up to 50% when compared to a widely used state-of-the-art outbreak detection algorithm. This improvement was achieved while maintaining an equivalent level of sensitivity, meaning the model was equally effective at identifying true outbreaks. The findings were consistent across evaluations using real *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* surveillance data and simulations.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This improved outbreak detection capability will lead to more efficient and effective resource allocation in public health. By significantly reducing false alarms, public health agencies can avoid unnecessary investigations and interventions, focusing resources on actual threats. This allows for faster, more targeted responses to real outbreaks, potentially limiting the spread of infectious diseases, protecting healthcare systems from surge capacity issues, and ultimately saving lives.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is a crucial task to protect population health. To this end, public health surveillance systems have been established to systematically collect and analyse infectious disease data. A variety of statistical tools are available, which detect potential outbreaks as abberations from an expected endemic level using these data. Here, we develop the first supervised learning approach based on hidden Markov models for disease outbreak detection, which leverages data that is routinely collected within a public health surveillance system. We evaluate our model using real Salmonella and Campylobacter data, as well as simulations. In comparison to a state-of-the-art approach, which is applied in multiple European countries including Germany, our proposed model reduces the false positive rate by up to 50% while retaining the same sensitivity. We see our supervised learning approach as a significant step to further develop machine learning applications for disease outbreak detection, which will be instrumental to improve public health surveillance systems.</p>
