                    <p>The authors developed a novel supervised learning approach, specifically a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), for disease outbreak detection. This method learns from historical, routinely collected infectious disease surveillance data to identify patterns indicative of outbreaks, moving beyond traditional statistical aberration detection. The model's performance was evaluated using real-world *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* data, as well as synthetic simulations, and benchmarked against a state-of-the-art statistical method.</p>

                    <p>The primary finding is that the proposed supervised HMM model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art statistical outbreak detection method by reducing the false positive rate by up to 50%. Critically, this improvement in specificity (fewer false alarms) was achieved while retaining the same level of sensitivity (ability to detect true outbreaks), demonstrating a more efficient and accurate detection capability.</p>

                <p>This research has a direct and significant clinical and practical impact on public health surveillance. By substantially reducing false positive alerts, public health agencies can allocate their limited resources more effectively to investigate genuine outbreaks, avoiding unnecessary investigations and associated costs. This leads to quicker, more targeted responses to real public health threats, ultimately improving disease control, patient outcomes, and overall population health protection.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is a crucial task to protect population health. To this end, public health surveillance systems have been established to systematically collect and analyse infectious disease data. A variety of statistical tools are available, which detect potential outbreaks as abberations from an expected endemic level using these data. Here, we develop the first supervised learning approach based on hidden Markov models for disease outbreak detection, which leverages data that is routinely collected within a public health surveillance system. We evaluate our model using real Salmonella and Campylobacter data, as well as simulations. In comparison to a state-of-the-art approach, which is applied in multiple European countries including Germany, our proposed model reduces the false positive rate by up to 50% while retaining the same sensitivity. We see our supervised learning approach as a significant step to further develop machine learning applications for disease outbreak detection, which will be instrumental to improve public health surveillance systems.</p>
