                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study addresses the challenge of translating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theories, which are based on imagistic thinking (metaphor and metonymy), into English without losing their underlying conceptual networks crucial for clinical application. Utilizing a human-in-the-loop framework and prompt engineering with DeepSeek V3.1, the research developed prompt-adjusted LLM translations that significantly outperformed human and baseline machine translations across five cognitive dimensions, as evaluated by simulated readers powered by ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable HITL methodological pathway for the translation of ancient, concept-dense texts such as TCM.</p>
