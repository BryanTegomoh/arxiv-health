                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This case report details a patient diagnosed with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) who initially presented with cognitive deficits, gait instability, and incontinence, 8 months after a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The initial CT imaging showed cerebral ventricle dilation, misleadingly mimicking hydrocephalus, until further specialized investigations confirmed sCJD as the underlying cause of cerebral atrophy.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This case improves clinicians' understanding of sCJD's varied and potentially misleading presentations, especially in the context of prior TBI and atypical imaging. It underscores the critical need for advanced diagnostic testing to correctly identify rare, rapidly progressive neurological conditions and prevent misdiagnosis.</p>

                    <p>Sporadic CJD can manifest with cerebral atrophy mimicking hydrocephalus, particularly after traumatic brain injury, which can complicate initial diagnosis. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, involving specific CSF biomarkers (14-3-3, tau), advanced neuroimaging (MRI), and electroencephalography (EEG), is crucial for accurate confirmation of sCJD in such atypical presentations. The patient's rapid clinical deterioration further supported the sCJD diagnosis.</p>

                <p>This case report enhances clinical awareness among neurologists, neurosurgeons, and radiologists regarding the diverse and challenging presentations of sCJD, especially when a history of TBI is present or when initial imaging suggests common conditions like hydrocephalus. It reinforces the necessity of specialized diagnostic investigations to achieve an accurate diagnosis, enabling appropriate patient management, counseling, and avoiding unnecessary interventions for misdiagnosed conditions.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Introduction Sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease sCJD is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease without effective treatment that usually results in death within one year. The recently applied methods have improved the accuracy of the disease diagnosis and the specific radiological findings provide the necessary information for differential diagnosis. Research question The research is aimed to provide a different perspective on the development of CJD and associated literature review. Materials and methods The study presents a case who presented cognitive deficits, gait instability, and urinary and fecal incontinence suffered from traumatic brain injury eight months ago before admission with cerebral ventricle dilation on CT images. Furthermore, studies describe relevant cases are also included. Results The patients symptoms got deteriorated. Further examinations, including 14-3-3 and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF, MRI, and EEG, confirmed the patients diagnosis of sCJD. He returned to the local hospital for the conservative treatment without effective medical intervention. Conclusion This case illustrates the diagnostic process of CJD and underscores the importance of distinguishing rare disorders from common conditions to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the disease.</p>
