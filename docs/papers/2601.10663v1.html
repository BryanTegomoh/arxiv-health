                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a case of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) in a patient who initially exhibited symptoms and imaging findings (cerebral ventricle dilation post-TBI) that mimicked hydrocephalus. The study details the diagnostic process, which eventually confirmed sCJD through specific CSF biomarkers (14-3-3 and tau proteins), characteristic MRI findings, and EEG abnormalities. It underscores the critical importance of a comprehensive differential diagnosis to distinguish rare neurodegenerative diseases from more common conditions.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This case report is highly relevant for clinicians, especially neurologists and neurosurgeons, as it illustrates an atypical presentation of sCJD that can mimic hydrocephalus. It emphasizes the critical need for a high index of suspicion and comprehensive neurological workup to accurately differentiate rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders from more common conditions, ensuring correct diagnosis and appropriate patient counseling despite the lack of effective treatment for sCJD.</p>

                <p>The clinical impact lies in enhancing diagnostic vigilance among healthcare professionals for rare neurodegenerative diseases like sCJD, especially in complex presentations that may initially suggest more common conditions. It reinforces the importance of utilizing specific diagnostic tools (CSF biomarkers, advanced MRI, EEG) for accurate differential diagnosis, leading to timely and correct patient management, even when effective curative treatments are unavailable.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Introduction Sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease sCJD is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease without effective treatment that usually results in death within one year. The recently applied methods have improved the accuracy of the disease diagnosis and the specific radiological findings provide the necessary information for differential diagnosis. Research question The research is aimed to provide a different perspective on the development of CJD and associated literature review. Materials and methods The study presents a case who presented cognitive deficits, gait instability, and urinary and fecal incontinence suffered from traumatic brain injury eight months ago before admission with cerebral ventricle dilation on CT images. Furthermore, studies describe relevant cases are also included. Results The patients symptoms got deteriorated. Further examinations, including 14-3-3 and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF, MRI, and EEG, confirmed the patients diagnosis of sCJD. He returned to the local hospital for the conservative treatment without effective medical intervention. Conclusion This case illustrates the diagnostic process of CJD and underscores the importance of distinguishing rare disorders from common conditions to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the disease.</p>
