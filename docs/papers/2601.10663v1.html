                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper presents a rare case of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) in a patient who initially presented with cerebral ventricle dilation mimicking hydrocephalus following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study highlights the diagnostic challenges and the importance of advanced neurological investigations, including CSF biomarkers, MRI, and EEG, to accurately diagnose sCJD in complex clinical scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This case report is highly relevant for neurologists, neurosurgeons, and radiologists as it details an unusual presentation of sporadic CJD mimicking hydrocephalus post-TBI, emphasizing the necessity of robust differential diagnosis and the specific diagnostic tools required for such rare and fatal neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

                    <li>A patient developed rapidly progressive cognitive deficits, gait instability, and incontinence eight months after a traumatic brain injury (TBI).</li>
                    
                    <li>Initial CT imaging revealed cerebral ventricle dilation, leading to a differential diagnosis that included hydrocephalus.</li>
                    
                    <li>The patient's symptoms deteriorated swiftly, prompting further comprehensive neurological evaluations.</li>
                    
                    <li>Diagnosis of sporadic CJD was confirmed by positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3 and tau protein levels, along with characteristic MRI and EEG findings.</li>
                    
                    <li>The case underscores the critical need for a high index of suspicion and thorough diagnostic workup to distinguish rare neurodegenerative diseases like sCJD from more common conditions, especially in the context of confounding factors like TBI.</li>
                    
                    <li>No effective medical intervention was available for the confirmed sCJD, and the patient received conservative care.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a case report format, detailing the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and progression of a single patient. Methods included initial CT imaging, subsequent analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for 14-3-3 and tau proteins, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalography (EEG). The case report is augmented by a literature review of relevant cases.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>A patient with a history of TBI presented with rapidly progressive dementia and neurological deficits, initially exhibiting cerebral ventricle dilation on CT, mimicking hydrocephalus. However, further investigations—specifically positive CSF 14-3-3 and tau proteins, coupled with characteristic MRI and EEG changes—confirmed the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, demonstrating an atypical presentation requiring advanced diagnostic scrutiny.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This case significantly enhances clinical awareness by illustrating that sCJD can present atypically, particularly following TBI and with imaging suggestive of hydrocephalus. It reinforces the importance of including sCJD in the differential diagnosis for rapidly progressive neurological deterioration, especially when initial findings are misleading, thereby guiding clinicians toward appropriate diagnostic tests and preventing misdiagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>As a single case report, the generalizability of its findings to broader patient populations is inherently limited. The abstract does not provide details on the extent or specific comparative analysis from the associated literature review.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly stated, the study implicitly suggests the need for further research into the potential relationship between TBI and the onset or presentation of neurodegenerative diseases like sCJD, and continued efforts to refine diagnostic algorithms for atypical presentations of rare disorders to improve early and accurate diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Introduction Sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease sCJD is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease without effective treatment that usually results in death within one year. The recently applied methods have improved the accuracy of the disease diagnosis and the specific radiological findings provide the necessary information for differential diagnosis. Research question The research is aimed to provide a different perspective on the development of CJD and associated literature review. Materials and methods The study presents a case who presented cognitive deficits, gait instability, and urinary and fecal incontinence suffered from traumatic brain injury eight months ago before admission with cerebral ventricle dilation on CT images. Furthermore, studies describe relevant cases are also included. Results The patients symptoms got deteriorated. Further examinations, including 14-3-3 and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF, MRI, and EEG, confirmed the patients diagnosis of sCJD. He returned to the local hospital for the conservative treatment without effective medical intervention. Conclusion This case illustrates the diagnostic process of CJD and underscores the importance of distinguishing rare disorders from common conditions to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the disease.</p>
