                    <p>The proposed method utilizes a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN). It preprocesses one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals by applying wavelet feature extraction to capture crucial temporal-spectral information.

This extreme compression allows the quantum stage of the network to operate with only 8 qubits, making it resource-efficient. The QCNN subsequently processes these compressed images to classify specific cardiac abnormalities such as S3 sounds and murmurs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.</p>
