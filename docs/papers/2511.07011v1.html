                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with seven specific features, including measures of lexical diversity and the use of absolutist language. For Dutch data, associations were observed with words per sentence and the frequency of positive words. Notably, no significant associations between lexical features and MDD symptom severity were found in recordings collected in Spain. Overall, the predictive power of both interpretable lexical features and high-dimensional vector embeddings, when tested with four different regressor ML models, was consistently found to be near chance level across all languages.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background: Captured between clinical appointments using mobile devices,
spoken language has potential for objective, more regular assessment of symptom
severity and earlier detection of relapse in major depressive disorder.
However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional
samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with
limited interpretability.
  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech
data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK,
Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify
interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear
mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector
embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor
ML models.
  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features
including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch,
associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency;
no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive
power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across
all languages.
  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological
choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes
observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our
feature choice.
  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research
and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several
languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and
between-individual variations in language.</p>
