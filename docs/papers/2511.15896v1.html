                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces cross-balancing, a novel method for designing and analyzing observational studies that allows for the incorporation of outcome data into the construction or selection of balancing features. By employing sample splitting, cross-balancing effectively separates errors in feature construction from weight estimation, leading to consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient causal effect estimators. This approach significantly improves both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability, addressing a long-standing challenge in valid outcome-informed causal inference.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Observational studies are fundamental in medical and health research for evaluating treatment effectiveness, disease risk factors, and health outcomes where randomized controlled trials are infeasible. This method offers a robust way to improve the validity and efficiency of causal inferences drawn from such studies, leading to more reliable evidence for clinical decision-making and public health strategies.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper's methodology, involving 'learned functions' and selection from 'high-dimensional dictionaries,' suggests that machine learning techniques can be integrated into the cross-balancing framework. This enables the development of AI applications that can more robustly perform causal inference on complex healthcare datasets (e.g., electronic health records, claims data). Such AI systems could identify causal links between treatments/exposures and health outcomes with greater accuracy and efficiency, supporting data-informed design of medical studies, personalized medicine, and population health management.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology is 'cross-balancing,' which hinges on sample splitting. The data is partitioned into independent subsets. In one subset, outcome information is used to construct (e.g., via machine learning) or select (from a high-dimensional set) optimal balancing features. In the other, independent subset, these constructed/selected features are used to estimate treatment effects and weights. This separation ensures that the outcome data used for feature engineering does not bias the subsequent statistical inference, maintaining validity.</p>

                    <p>Cross-balancing produces consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient causal effect estimators. It achieves finite-sample bias reduction and multiply robustness for learned features, even with slow convergence rates. For variable selection, it requires a mild product condition on feature approximation. Empirically, simulations and an observational study demonstrated that this careful use of outcome information significantly improves both the accuracy of effect estimation and the reliability of statistical inference compared to existing methods.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>By providing a method for more robust and efficient causal inference, cross-balancing can significantly improve the quality of evidence derived from real-world observational medical data. This can lead to more accurate assessments of treatment efficacy and safety, better-informed clinical guidelines, more reliable risk factor identification, and ultimately, more effective and safer patient care and public health interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal inference starts with a simple idea: compare groups that differ by treatment, not much else. Traditionally, similar groups are constructed using only observed covariates; however, it remains a long-standing challenge to incorporate available outcome data into the study design while preserving valid inference. In this paper, we study the general problem of covariate adjustment, effect estimation, and statistical inference when balancing features are constructed or selected with the aid of outcome information from the data. We propose cross-balancing, a method that uses sample splitting to separate the error in feature construction from the error in weight estimation. Our framework addresses two cases: one where the features are learned functions and one where they are selected from a potentially high-dimensional dictionary. In both cases, we establish mild and general conditions under which cross-balancing produces consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators. In the learned-function case, cross-balancing achieves finite-sample bias reduction relative to plug-in-type estimators, and is multiply robust when the learned features converge at slow rates. In the variable-selection case, cross-balancing only requires a product condition on how well the selected variables approximate true functions. We illustrate cross-balancing in extensive simulations and an observational study, showing that careful use of outcome information can substantially improve both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability.</p>
