                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces cross-balancing, a novel method for causal inference in observational studies that strategically incorporates outcome data into the study design to construct or select balancing features. By employing sample splitting, it effectively separates errors in feature construction from errors in weight estimation, resulting in consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators for treatment effects. The method substantially improves both estimation and inference across scenarios, including high-dimensional variable selection and learned functions, while maintaining interpretability.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This method is highly relevant to medicine and health research as it enables more robust, efficient, and interpretable causal inference from observational studies, which are frequently used to evaluate treatment effectiveness, assess disease risk factors, and inform public health interventions when randomized controlled trials are infeasible or unethical.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides methodological improvements for causal inference in observational studies, which is crucial for developing robust AI systems in medicine. For instance, AI applications aiming to personalize treatment recommendations, identify optimal interventions from real-world data, or evaluate the causal impact of health policies would benefit from methods like cross-balancing to ensure that discovered associations are truly causal and not spurious correlations. Specifically, when machine learning (AI) models are used to construct features or learn relationships in complex observational health datasets, this methodology helps ensure the validity and efficiency of the subsequent causal effect estimation.</p>

                    <li>Proposes "cross-balancing," a methodology that uses sample splitting to disentangle the error introduced during feature construction (which may use outcome information) from the error in subsequent weight estimation for causal inference.</li>
                    
                    <li>The framework is robust and applicable to two key scenarios: when balancing features are learned functions, and when they are selected from a potentially high-dimensional dictionary of covariates.</li>
                    
                    <li>Under mild and general conditions, cross-balancing is shown to produce estimators that are consistent, asymptotically normal, and statistically efficient in both learned-function and variable-selection contexts.</li>
                    
                    <li>For learned functions, cross-balancing achieves finite-sample bias reduction relative to traditional plug-in-type estimators and offers multiple robustness, even when the learned features converge at slower rates.</li>
                    
                    <li>In the variable-selection case, the method imposes a less stringent 'product condition' on how well the selected variables approximate the true underlying functions, simplifying requirements for high-dimensional data.</li>
                    
                    <li>Extensive simulations and an illustrative observational study empirically validate that cross-balancing significantly enhances both the accuracy of treatment effect estimation and the validity of statistical inference.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Cross-balancing operates by applying sample splitting. Data is partitioned into multiple sets; one set is used to construct or select balancing features (potentially leveraging outcome information), while the *other*, independent set is subsequently used to estimate treatment weights, effects, and perform inference based on these pre-constructed features. This separation ensures that the outcome data used for feature construction does not directly bias the final causal effect estimation, thereby maintaining inferential validity.</p>

                    <p>The study demonstrates that cross-balancing yields consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators for causal effects in observational studies. It provides finite-sample bias reduction and exhibits multiple robustness for learned features, and requires only a product condition for effective variable selection in high-dimensional settings.

                <p>By providing a statistically rigorous and efficient approach to leverage outcome data in observational study design, cross-balancing can significantly improve the quality and reliability of evidence derived from real-world data.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Causal inference starts with a simple idea: compare groups that differ by treatment, not much else. Traditionally, similar groups are constructed using only observed covariates; however, it remains a long-standing challenge to incorporate available outcome data into the study design while preserving valid inference. In this paper, we study the general problem of covariate adjustment, effect estimation, and statistical inference when balancing features are constructed or selected with the aid of outcome information from the data. We propose cross-balancing, a method that uses sample splitting to separate the error in feature construction from the error in weight estimation. Our framework addresses two cases: one where the features are learned functions and one where they are selected from a potentially high-dimensional dictionary. In both cases, we establish mild and general conditions under which cross-balancing produces consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators. In the learned-function case, cross-balancing achieves finite-sample bias reduction relative to plug-in-type estimators, and is multiply robust when the learned features converge at slow rates. In the variable-selection case, cross-balancing only requires a product condition on how well the selected variables approximate true functions. We illustrate cross-balancing in extensive simulations and an observational study, showing that careful use of outcome information can substantially improve both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability.</p>
