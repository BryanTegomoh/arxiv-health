                <p>The research provides a methodological advancement in medical AI by developing more robust and accurate Graph R-Learner models using GNNs. This can be applied to: 1) Estimate personalized treatment effects for patients based on their individual characteristics and their position within relevant networks (e.g., social, genetic, clinical). 2) Inform targeted public health interventions by predicting how an intervention might spread or be adopted within a community network. 3) Analyze drug efficacy and safety by understanding their causal effects within complex biological interaction networks. 4) Improve clinical decision support systems by providing more nuanced predictions of treatment outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The R-Learner is a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, prized for its robustness to nuisance model errors. However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic "representation bottleneck": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent "nuisance bottleneck," linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted "Hub-Periphery Trade-off" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical "final-stage bottleneck."</p>
