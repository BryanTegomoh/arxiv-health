                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often
characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their
structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways.
Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network
Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially
in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent
Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic
acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic
topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It
reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the
homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its
localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on
three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures,
and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM
and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson
correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the
robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular
interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as
mutation impact analysis and drug design.</p>
