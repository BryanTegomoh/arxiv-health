                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates collective cell flows in MDCK epithelial monolayers under geometric confinement, revealing the emergence of scale-free spatial velocity correlations. These correlations follow a power law, challenging the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length and suggesting the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system capable of long-range information and stress propagation. The study also demonstrates that substrate properties (e.g., rigidity) and boundary conditions significantly influence flow organization and the distribution of mechanical markers like vimentin.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding the fundamental principles of collective cell flows and their scale-free organization is vital for comprehending complex biological processes such as embryonic development, effective wound healing, and aberrant tissue dynamics in diseases like cancer metastasis. The insights into how geometric confinement, substrate mechanics, and boundary conditions dictate cell collective behavior can inform strategies for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and therapeutic interventions against pathological cell migration.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself does not utilize AI, the fundamental insights gained from this research could be foundational for future medical AI applications. For example, AI models could be developed to: 
1. Predict wound healing trajectories and optimize treatment strategies by analyzing collective cell movement patterns under various conditions. 
2. Forecast cancer metastasis risk based on primary tumor stiffness, cell migration dynamics, and changes in cytoskeletal markers (like vimentin accumulation). 
3. Design and optimize biomaterials and scaffolds for tissue engineering by simulating and predicting cell organizational patterns and mechanical responses to different geometric confinements and rigidities.

                    <p>The key findings include the emergence of time-dependent, long-range velocity correlations and collective flow domains. Spatial velocity correlations were identified as scale-free, following a power law, indicating the absence of a single intrinsic correlation length and suggesting critical-like behavior. This critical-like system enables long-range information and stress propagation. Furthermore, the correlation exponent evolves with time (maturation), collective motions are stronger on soft substrates, and free fronts lead to significantly larger-scale vimentin accumulation (65 µm vs. 3.2 µm for fixed boundaries), potentially revealing a polarizing cue for cell velocity.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The elucidation of scale-free correlations and critical-like behavior in epithelial monolayers provides a novel framework for understanding tissue mechanics and organization, which could lead to improved therapeutic approaches. For instance, interventions targeting the mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment or specific mechanotransduction pathways could potentially modulate pathological collective cell migration in cancer or enhance tissue regeneration in wound healing. This fundamental knowledge supports the development of more effective biomedical materials and in vitro disease models by considering long-range mechanical signaling.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\pm 4$~$μ$m vs $3.2 \pm 0.7$~$μ$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.</p>
