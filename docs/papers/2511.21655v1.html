                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates collective cell flows in MDCK epithelial monolayers under geometric confinement, revealing that spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. The study demonstrates that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system capable of long-range information transmission and stress propagation, and highlights how substrate properties and boundary conditions modulate flow organization and vimentin distribution.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized MDCK epithelial cell monolayers cultured on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates, including strips and closed racetracks, with varying boundary conditions (free front or fixed) and substrate rigidities (soft vs. hard). Over tens of hours, the researchers quantified collective cell flows, analyzed velocity fields, measured kinetic energy and enstrophy, and characterized spatial velocity correlations using power-law fitting. Protein distribution, specifically vimentin accumulation, was also assessed at different boundary types.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Spatial velocity correlations in MDCK monolayers are scale-free, following a power law, which indicates long-range propagation of information/stress rather than a characteristic length scale. The system's kinetic energy and enstrophy increase and then decrease over a ~5-hour period, reflecting dynamic changes during monolayer maturation. The correlation exponent describing scale-free behavior evolves significantly with time, underscoring the dynamic nature of collective coordination. Geometric confinement (size, shape, topology) and substrate rigidity profoundly influence the organization of cell flows and mechanical fields, with softer substrates promoting more robust spontaneous collective motions. The presence of a free boundary strongly polarizes the monolayer, resulting in vimentin accumulation over a length scale approximately 20 times larger (65 µm) than at fixed boundaries (3.2 µm), suggesting a unique mechanical or biochemical cue.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\pm 4$~$μ$m vs $3.2 \pm 0.7$~$μ$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.</p>
