                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research reveals that epithelial cell monolayers exhibit scale-free velocity correlations, challenging the concept of a single intrinsic correlation length and suggesting critical-like system behavior with long-range information transmission. The study demonstrates that geometric confinement, substrate rigidity, and boundary conditions significantly influence collective cell flows, mechanical fields, and vimentin distribution during tissue maturation.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding collective cell flows and their regulation by physical cues is fundamental for comprehending tissue development, regeneration (e.g., wound healing), and pathological processes like cancer invasion and metastasis. The identified scale-free correlations and critical-like behavior provide insights into how information and forces are propagated across tissues, impacting their overall function and disease progression.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>While the paper itself does not apply AI, the quantitative insights into collective cell dynamics (e.g., scale-free velocity correlations, impact of substrate rigidity, vimentin accumulation patterns) could be instrumental for developing AI applications in health. For instance, AI models could be trained using such data to: 1) Analyze microscopic images of tissues for automated disease diagnosis (e.g., identifying abnormal cell flow patterns or mechanosensing changes indicative of cancer or fibrosis). 2) Predict the efficacy of drugs or therapies by simulating or classifying cell monolayer responses. 3) Design advanced biomaterials for regenerative medicine by predicting how cells will organize and function on different substrates. 4) Model tissue development or disease progression based on quantified cellular mechanics.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved experimental observations of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell monolayers grown on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates. These substrates varied in size, shape, topology (strip or closed racetrack), and rigidity, and experiments were conducted with or without a free cell front boundary. Cell behaviors were observed over tens of hours, focusing on velocity fields, enstrophy, kinetic energy, and spatial velocity correlations. Vimentin accumulation was also measured in relation to boundary conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The key findings include the emergence of domains and long-range velocity correlations over time, with enstrophy and kinetic energy peaking around 5 hours. Critically, spatial velocity correlations were found to be scale-free, following a power law, suggesting the monolayer functions as a critical-like system capable of long-range stress propagation rather than having a fixed intrinsic correlation length. The spatial correlation exponent varied significantly with monolayer maturation. Substrate characteristics (size, shape, topology, rigidity) strongly influenced flow organization, with softer substrates promoting more robust collective motion. Furthermore, a free cell front significantly increased the length scale of vimentin accumulation (65 µm) compared to fixed boundaries (3.2 µm), potentially revealing a polarizing cue affecting cell velocity.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms governing collective cell behavior, which is critical for tissue homeostasis and disease. It could inform strategies for designing better tissue engineering scaffolds, developing novel therapeutic targets for metastatic cancer (by disrupting pathological cell migration), and enhancing wound healing processes by optimizing the mechanical microenvironment. The identification of long-range information transmission could also lead to new diagnostic or prognostic markers based on tissue mechanics.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations.

                <p>Future research should focus on definitively identifying the molecular and biophysical nature of the 'underlying polarizing cue' at free fronts and its precise mechanism of action on vimentin distribution and cell velocity. Further investigation into the 'critical-like system' behavior could explore its robustness across different cell types and tissue contexts, potentially leveraging this understanding for therapeutic interventions that modulate tissue mechanics and cell migration in disease.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\pm 4$~$μ$m vs $3.2 \pm 0.7$~$μ$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.</p>
