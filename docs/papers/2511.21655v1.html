                <p>The quantitative data and principles revealed by this research (e.g., scale-free velocity correlations, impact of substrate rigidity on collective cell motion, vimentin dynamics) could be used to train AI models. For instance, AI could be employed to predict tissue behavior in wound healing or disease progression (e.g., tumor invasion) based on these mechanical principles. Deep learning models could be developed to identify abnormal collective cell migration patterns from high-throughput microscopy images, potentially aiding in early disease detection or evaluating therapeutic responses. AI could also simulate and predict drug effects on tissue dynamics by integrating these mechanobiological insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\pm 4$~$μ$m vs $3.2 \pm 0.7$~$μ$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.</p>
