                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces MedMistake, an automatic pipeline designed to extract and benchmark Large Language Model (LLM) mistakes within medical conversations. It creates complex patient-doctor dialogues, uses LLM judges to identify errors across multiple dimensions, and converts these into single-shot QA pairs, revealing that even frontier LLMs like GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro make mistakes, with GPT, Claude, and Grok performing best on the resulting expert-validated benchmark.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul class="key-points">
                    
                    <li>**Automated Mistake Replication**: The paper addresses the challenge of manually replicating LLM errors in clinical settings by introducing MedMistake, an automatic pipeline.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Three-Step Pipeline**: MedMistake operates in three stages: (1) generation of complex, multi-turn patient-doctor conversations using LLMs, (2) evaluation of these dialogues by a committee of two LLM judges for reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness, and (3) conversion of identified mistakes into simplified single-shot QA scenarios.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Dataset Creation**: The pipeline generated MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where frontier models like GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro initially failed to provide correct answers as judged by LLMs.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Medical Expert Validation**: A critical subset of 211 questions from MedMistake-All was meticulously validated by medical experts, forming the higher-fidelity benchmark known as MedMistake-Bench.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Extensive LLM Evaluation**: A comprehensive evaluation was conducted on MedMistake-Bench against 12 frontier LLMs, including Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5 series, Grok 4, and Mistral Large.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Performance Findings**: GPT models (GPT-4o, GPT-5 variants), Claude models (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5), and Grok models (4, 4.1) demonstrated the best performance on the MedMistake-Bench.</li>
                    
                    <li>**Public Release**: Both the full MedMistake-All dataset and the expert-validated MedMistake-Bench are publicly released to foster further research and development in medical AI safety.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The MedMistake pipeline constructs complex medical dialogues by having one LLM play a patient and another an LLM doctor. A committee of two LLM judges then evaluates these conversations across various dimensions, including reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness, to pinpoint errors. These identified mistakes are subsequently distilled into simplified, single-shot Question-Answering (QA) pairs. A subset of these QA pairs (MedMistake-Bench) underwent validation by medical experts, and this expert-validated benchmark was then used to rigorously evaluate the performance of 12 state-of-the-art LLMs.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study found that even advanced frontier LLMs, such as GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, frequently make medical errors in complex conversational scenarios. When tested on the expert-validated MedMistake-Bench, GPT models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-5 series), Claude models (e.g., Opus 4.5), and Grok models (e.g., Grok 4) consistently exhibited the strongest performance, suggesting they possess a relatively higher capacity for accurate medical reasoning and safety compared to other evaluated models.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a practical, automated mechanism for identifying and mitigating critical medical errors in LLMs, which is paramount for their safe integration into clinical practice. By providing a high-quality, expert-validated benchmark, it will drive the development of more reliable AI systems capable of assisting healthcare professionals and patients without compromising safety or accuracy, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and utility of AI in diverse clinical applications.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, potential limitations could include the inherent biases or potential inaccuracies of LLM judges in error identification, the scope of medical scenarios covered by the generated conversations, and that only a subset (211/3390) of the full dataset was validated by medical experts, meaning the quality across the entire MedMistake-All dataset might vary.</p>

                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state future research directions. However, potential future work could involve expanding the MedMistake benchmark to encompass a broader range of medical specialties, disease states, and complex error types; exploring alternative human-in-the-loop evaluation strategies beyond subset validation; and developing more sophisticated error detection and explanation mechanisms within the pipeline.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.</p>
