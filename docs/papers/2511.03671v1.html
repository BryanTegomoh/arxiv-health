                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the dynamics of two asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons, revealing multistability with distinct chaotic and nonchaotic attractors. It demonstrates that despite individual non-chaoticity, the coupled system's state space is dominated by a chaotic basin, separated by a fractal boundary that leads to extreme final state sensitivity, with significant implications for biological neuron synchronization and neurological disease understanding.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state
uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo
neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the
mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined
by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be
multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron
is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the
coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity
due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be
fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its
potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have
significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological
disease.</p>
