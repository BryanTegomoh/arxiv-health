                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper investigates the complex dynamics of two asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons, revealing that the system exhibits multistability with distinct chaotic and nonchaotic attractors despite individual non-chaotic behavior. A significant finding is the fractal nature of the basin boundaries, which leads to extreme final state sensitivity. The authors propose that this uncertainty in neural synchronization has crucial implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>The discovery of fractal basin boundaries leading to extreme final state sensitivity in coupled neurons suggests that subtle initial conditions can drastically alter neural network behavior. This mechanism could explain unpredictable aspects of brain function, disease onset, or treatment response, impacting our understanding of neurological conditions and complex human behaviors.</p>

                    <p>The authors employed computational and mathematical analysis to investigate and quantify the basin geometry and final state uncertainty of a system comprising two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons.

                    <p>The study found that the coupled Chialvo neuron system is multistable with two qualitatively distinct attractors. Although individual neurons are nonchaotic, the coupled system's state space is largely dominated by a chaotic basin, while a nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. Crucially, the boundary separating these basins is fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity, where minute changes in initial conditions can result in vastly different long-term outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The understanding of extreme final state sensitivity in coupled neuronal systems due to fractal basin boundaries could have profound clinical impact. It may provide a theoretical basis for the observed variability and unpredictability in neurological disorders like epilepsy or mood disorders, where subtle perturbations might trigger pathological states. This insight could inform the development of more personalized and targeted interventions aimed at stabilizing neural network dynamics or preventing transitions to undesirable states.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state
uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo
neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the
mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined
by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be
multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron
is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the
coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity
due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be
fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its
potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have
significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological
disease.</p>
