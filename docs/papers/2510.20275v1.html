                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), a novel BERT-based model designed to significantly enhance human mobility forecasting by integrating both derived temporal descriptors and Points of Interest (POI) embeddings. It addresses the shortcomings of existing models that either neglect POI semantics or treat time as mere auxiliary input, thereby failing to capture rich contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate STaBERT's superior performance, boosting GEO-BLEU scores dramatically for both single-city (0.34 to 0.75) and multi-city (0.34 to 0.56) predictions.</p>

                    <li>**Problem Addressed**: Existing human mobility forecasting models are limited by their inability to fully leverage the rich semantic context from Points of Interest (POIs) and by treating temporal information inadequately as auxiliary input.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed STaBERT, a BERT-based deep learning model, which is augmented with 'classical feature embeddings'. The core methodology involves incorporating derived temporal descriptors (e.g., hour of day, day of week, specific event times) and POI embeddings (semantic features of locations like 'hospital', 'park', 'residential area') directly into the input sequence at each location. This integration creates a unified, semantically enriched representation of human mobility, which is then processed by the BERT architecture to improve the accuracy of movement sequence prediction.</p>

For single-city predictions, the GEO-BLEU score surged from a baseline of 0.34 to 0.75. In multi-city prediction scenarios, the GEO-BLEU score also saw a substantial increase from 0.34 to 0.56, demonstrating the model's robustness and the effectiveness of integrating semantic and temporal features.</p>

                <p>Enhanced human mobility prediction can have a significant clinical and public health impact by enabling more precise epidemiological modeling for disease outbreak forecasting, optimizing the logistical deployment of medical teams and emergency supplies during disaster relief, and improving the strategic planning of healthcare facility locations and service accessibility based on dynamic population movements. This also allows for more effective identification of communities requiring urgent health interventions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.</p>
