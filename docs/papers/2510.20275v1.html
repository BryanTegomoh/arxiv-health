                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">The paper introduces STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), a novel BERT-based model designed to significantly improve human mobility prediction by deeply integrating rich semantic context from Points of Interest (POIs) and derived temporal descriptors. This approach constructs a unified, semantically enriched representation for each location, addressing the limitations of prior models that underutilized such contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy for both single-city and multi-city scenarios.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed STaBERT, an enhanced BERT-based mobility model. This model integrates 'classical feature embeddings' by incorporating both derived temporal descriptors (e.g., time of day, day of week) and POI embeddings (representing the semantic nature of a location) directly into the representation for each point in a human mobility sequence. This creates a unified, semantically enriched representation, allowing the BERT architecture to capture deeper contextual information that previous models, which often only used location sequences or minimal temporal input, failed to leverage.</p>

For multi-city prediction tasks, the GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.56, demonstrating the model's robustness and superior performance across different geographic scales.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.</p>
