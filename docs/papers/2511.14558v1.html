                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a novel clustering-based explainability technique for convolutional neural network models used in digital pathology. Unlike traditional saliency map methods that offer local explanations, this approach provides insights into the global behavior of the model through visualization of activation clusters, offering both a broader understanding and fine-grained information. The authors demonstrate its utility by evaluating it on an existing prostate cancer detection model, showing it can increase confidence in model operation and facilitate clinical adoption.</p>

                    <p>The core methodology involves a clustering-based explainability technique applied to the activations of convolutional neural networks. This method processes the internal representations learned by the CNNs and groups similar activation patterns into clusters, which can then be visualized to infer global model behavior and fine-grained decision criteria, contrasting with local saliency-based approaches.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.</p>
