                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study involved fine-tuning pre-trained deep learning audio models (Audio-MAE and PANN architectures: CNN6, CNN10, CNN14). These models were trained and evaluated on two benchmark datasets, Coswara and COUGHVID, using both intra-dataset validation and cross-dataset generalization tests. A key methodological aspect was the implementation of a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to eliminate spurious correlations, which resulted in reduced, but more controlled, dataset sizes (1,219-2,160 samples). Performance was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1-score metrics.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Intra-dataset performance was found to be moderate, with Audio-MAE achieving the highest results on the Coswara dataset (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models showed limited performance on COUGHVID (AUC 0.58-0.63). A critical finding was the severe generalization failure observed during cross-dataset evaluation, where AUC scores ranged from 0.43-0.68, and Audio-MAE's F1-score plummeted to 0.00-0.08. This demonstrated that demographic balancing, by removing 'demographic leakage', provided a more realistic assessment of model capabilities, albeit with reduced apparent performance. The study concluded that the limited dataset sizes remaining after balancing were insufficient for training robust deep learning models capable of generalizable COVID-19 detection.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings have significant clinical implications, indicating that audio-based COVID-19 detection systems developed without rigorous demographic controls may yield artificially inflated performance metrics and fail severely in real-world, diverse populations. For clinical deployment, such systems must demonstrate robust generalization capabilities across varying demographics and environmental conditions, free from biases that could lead to misdiagnosis or inequitable access. This research highlights the need for a fundamental shift towards developing larger, meticulously balanced datasets and more resilient AI models to ensure clinically robust and equitable diagnostic tools.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitations identified are: (1) The significantly reduced dataset sizes (1,219-2,160 samples) after strict demographic balancing, which were insufficient for deep learning models that typically require larger training sets. (2) The severe generalization failure observed across datasets, indicating models struggled to learn robust, universally applicable features for COVID-19 detection and likely exploited dataset-specific or demographic spurious correlations.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>While not explicitly outlined as 'future directions', the report strongly implies the necessity for: (1) The development and collection of substantially larger, more diverse, and demographically balanced audio datasets for COVID-19 detection. (2) Research into novel deep learning architectures or training techniques that can effectively learn generalizable features from potentially smaller, high-quality, balanced datasets. (3) A deeper investigation into intrinsic acoustic biomarkers truly indicative of COVID-19, independent of confounding demographic factors, to guide more robust model development.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This technical report investigates the performance of pre-trained audio models on COVID-19 detection tasks using established benchmark datasets. We fine-tuned Audio-MAE and three PANN architectures (CNN6, CNN10, CNN14) on the Coswara and COUGHVID datasets, evaluating both intra-dataset and cross-dataset generalization. We implemented a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to prevent models from exploiting spurious correlations between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 status. Intra-dataset results showed moderate performance, with Audio-MAE achieving the strongest result on Coswara (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models demonstrated limited performance on Coughvid (AUC 0.58-0.63). Cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization failure across all models (AUC 0.43-0.68), with Audio-MAE showing strong performance degradation (F1-score 0.00-0.08). Our experiments demonstrate that demographic balancing, while reducing apparent model performance, provides more realistic assessment of COVID-19 detection capabilities by eliminating demographic leakage - a confounding factor that inflate performance metrics. Additionally, the limited dataset sizes after balancing (1,219-2,160 samples) proved insufficient for deep learning models that typically require substantially larger training sets. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in developing generalizable audio-based COVID-19 detection systems and underscore the importance of rigorous demographic controls for clinically robust model evaluation.</p>
