                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study benchmarks the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B against Smaller Language Models (SLMs) such as BioBERT and Word2Vec for predicting shock in critically ill ICU patients using text data from the MIMIC III database. The findings indicate that while GatorTron-Base achieved the highest weighted recall, the overall predictive performance metrics were comparable between LLMs and SLMs, suggesting that LLMs are not inherently superior for predicting future clinical events in this context.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study utilized text data extracted from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database. Patients were categorized based on length of stay (> 24 hours) and shock index (SI > 0.7 for abnormal SI), resulting in an imbalanced dataset (355 normal vs. 87 abnormal SI). Various LLMs (GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B) and SLMs (BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) were finetuned using focal and cross-entropy loss functions to address class imbalance. Performance was evaluated primarily using weighted recall and other comparable metrics.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides a crucial benchmark for the application of advanced language models in critical care predictive analytics. The finding that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs for this specific predictive task suggests that simpler, potentially more computationally efficient models might be adequate. This could guide resource allocation for developing AI tools, emphasizing that model complexity doesn't automatically equate to better clinical utility, particularly for text-based predictive tasks.</p>

                <p>While not explicitly stated as 'limitations' in the abstract, the study's scope is confined to text data from the MIMIC III database and a specific predictive task (shock). The conclusion that LLMs are not inherently superior might be limited to current LLM architectures and training paradigms, or the specific characteristics of the dataset and task. The inherent class imbalance, despite mitigation, could also impact generalizability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.</p>
