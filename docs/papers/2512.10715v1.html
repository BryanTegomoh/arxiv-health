                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical need for uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation, specifically for landmark-based anatomical segmentation in chest X-rays, which offers inherent topological guarantees but has been underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. Leveraging hybrid neural networks with variational latent spaces, the authors derive two complementary uncertainty measures (latent and predictive) and demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying unreliable predictions, reflecting perturbation severity, and supporting out-of-distribution detection. A significant contribution is the release of CheXmask-U, a large-scale dataset of chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates to facilitate further research and safer clinical deployment.</p>

                    <p>The methodology is based on hybrid neural network architectures that integrate standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders. By leveraging the variational latent space of these networks, two distinct uncertainty measures are derived: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distributional parameters of the latent space, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, generated by sampling multiple stochastic outputs from the latent space. These measures were validated using controlled corruption experiments to assess their response to perturbations and their ability to detect unreliable or out-of-distribution predictions.</p>

                    <p>The study demonstrates that both derived latent and predictive uncertainty measures reliably increase with perturbation severity, indicating both global and local degradations in segmentation quality. These uncertainty signals effectively identify unreliable anatomical predictions when compared against manual ground-truth and prove useful for out-of-distribution detection within the CheXmask dataset. Crucially, the research culminates in the release of CheXmask-U, a substantial dataset comprising 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations, each augmented with per-node uncertainty estimates, thus providing a valuable resource for future research into spatial segmentation quality variations.</p>

                <p>This work has significant clinical impact by enhancing the trustworthiness and safety of AI-driven anatomical segmentation in radiology. Clinicians can utilize these uncertainty estimates to identify and triage X-ray images where the AI's segmentation might be less reliable, prompting closer human inspection and reducing the risk of misdiagnosis. This capability fosters greater confidence in AI tools, facilitates human oversight, and supports the responsible integration of AI into diagnostic workflows, particularly for chest X-ray analysis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.</p>
