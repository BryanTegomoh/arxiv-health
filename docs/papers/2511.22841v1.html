                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework, a novel phylogenetic-free and bias-correcting method for profiling global SARS-CoV-2 variant source-sink dynamics. Applying S-EPS to 6.6 million genomes, the study identified Africa and the Indian subcontinent as predominant sources of key mutations, established a predictive model for global spread from these sources, and highlighted the framework's utility for enhanced genetic surveillance of emerging viral threats.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Understanding the global dispersal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including their origins and spread dynamics, is critical for effective public health surveillance, early identification of new threats, and informing timely interventions such as vaccine updates or targeted travel advisories. This framework provides a predictive tool to anticipate the spread of clinically significant mutations.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The S-EPS framework is a novel, phylogenetic-free, bias-correcting computational framework designed to profile viral source-sink dynamics and predict the global spread of key mutations. While not explicitly labeled as 'AI,' it functions as an advanced predictive analytics tool, processing large-scale genomic data to provide critical foresight for public health decision-making and early warning systems for emerging viral threats. This aligns with AI/computational applications in bioinformatics, epidemiology, and health surveillance.</p>

                    <p>The study developed the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework. This novel methodology is described as a phylogenetic-free and bias-correcting approach specifically designed to profile viral source-sink dynamics. It was applied to an extensive dataset comprising 6.6 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected globally from 13 distinct regions over a period spanning from March 2020 to June 2024, to analyze mutation dynamics and identify regional roles in viral circulation.</p>

                    <p>Africa and the Indian subcontinent were identified as the predominant global sources for key SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Southeast Asia served as an early transmission hub, while Russia and South America typically acted as viral sinks. The study revealed that key mutations required a longer time to establish fitness within their source regions compared to external environments. Critically, it established a predictive metric: an amino acid substitution on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) reaching 1% prevalence in major source regions indicates an 80% probability of spreading elsewhere globally, with a median lead time of 2 months (interquartile range: 1-4 months).</p>

                <p>The S-EPS framework provides a powerful, predictive tool for public health authorities to enhance genetic surveillance and early warning systems for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. By identifying potential source regions and predicting the global spread of key mutations with a significant lead time, it can enable proactive implementation of mitigation strategies, inform vaccine development and updates, guide diagnostic test improvements, and facilitate targeted public health interventions ahead of widespread outbreaks, ultimately improving epidemic preparedness and response.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has caused recurring epidemic waves, understanding its global dispersal patterns is critical for effective surveillance. We developed the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework, a phylogenetic-free, bias-correcting framework for profiling viral source-sink dynamics. Applying S-EPS to 6.6 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes (March 2020 - June 2024) from 13 regions worldwide, we identified Africa and the Indian subcontinent as the predominant sources of key mutations. Southeast Asia serves as an early transmission hub, while Russia and South America mainly acted as sinks. Key mutations took longer to establish fitness in source regions than externally. Once an amino acid substitution on the receptor-binding domain reached 1% prevalence in major sources, there is an 80% probability it would spread elsewhere, with a 2-month median lead time (IQR: 1-4). Our findings underscore the importance of genetic surveillance, with S-EPS offering enhanced capability for monitoring emerging viral threats.</p>
