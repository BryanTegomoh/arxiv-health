                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on
the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein
pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent
contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while
overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance
generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses
challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a
two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence
information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive
representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence
pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored
data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and
ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence
and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while
introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task
guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein
sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining
protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently
improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding
site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in
contrastive learning.</p>
