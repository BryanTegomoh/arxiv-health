                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces UbiQVision, a novel framework designed to quantify uncertainty in SHAP-based eXplainable AI (XAI) visualizations, particularly in medical imaging applications. It addresses the instability and unreliability of SHAP explanations, which stem from epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in complex deep learning models, by leveraging Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory. The framework provides uncertainty quantification through belief, plausible, and fusion maps, validated across diverse medical imaging datasets from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.</p>
