                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the critical issue of Deep Learning (DL) models failing to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) medical imaging data, particularly for COVID-19 detection from Chest X-rays (CXRs), due to learning source-specific artifacts. The study proposes and empirically demonstrates that injecting fundamental noise (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, Salt and Pepper) during model training significantly improves OOD generalization, drastically reducing the performance gap between in-distribution and OOD evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at
