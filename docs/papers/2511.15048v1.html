                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenge of predicting COVID-19 patient length of stay (LOS) as a measure of disease severity, particularly focusing on the inherent data imbalance where short stays are more common. The proposed methodology leverages synthetic oversampling techniques to balance the training data, subsequently employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) whose hyperparameters are optimized using Bayesian optimization, with the final model selected based on its F1 score.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that caused a global pandemic in 2019. It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets. Once we have this oversampled data, we run it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which during training has its hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. We select the model with the best F1 score and then evaluate it and discuss it.</p>
