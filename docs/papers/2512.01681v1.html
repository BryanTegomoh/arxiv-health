                <p class="summary-text">This research demonstrates a cross-domain validation approach where a self-supervised encoder, initially trained on large resection tissue images, effectively extracts meaningful morphological patterns from smaller mesothelioma biopsy material. This model successfully leverages these patterns to accurately predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes, addressing a significant limitation of traditional computational pathology models in real-world clinical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate subtype classification and outcome prediction in mesothelioma are essential for guiding therapy and patient care. Most computational pathology models are trained on large tissue images from resection specimens, limiting their use in real-world settings where small biopsies are common. We show that a self-supervised encoder trained on resection tissue can be applied to biopsy material, capturing meaningful morphological patterns. Using these patterns, the model can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to support diagnosis and treatment planning in mesothelioma.</p>
