                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study proposes a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework targeting ten imbalanced retinal disease classes in the RFMiD dataset. The methodology comprises three core components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, which guarantees equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode to counter class imbalance; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and other color/geometry transformations, specifically applied to enhance the diversity and representation of minority classes; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder, pre-trained on ImageNet, selected for its capability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Classification is performed by computing prototypes in the embedding space and using cosine similarity for improved stability. The framework was trained over 100 episodes and rigorously evaluated on 1,000 test episodes.</p>

                    <p>The proposed framework achieved substantial accuracy gains in retinal disease diagnosis, demonstrating a significant reduction in bias toward majority classes. Notably, the method yielded marked improvements for underrepresented diseases, such as Optic Disc Edema and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion. These results indicate that a dataset-aware few-shot learning pipeline, when combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, is highly effective in delivering more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under conditions of limited labeled data.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research can significantly improve the clinical utility of automated retinal disease diagnosis, particularly in settings with limited data or for rare conditions. By enabling accurate and fair diagnosis of both common and underrepresented retinal diseases, it can facilitate earlier detection, more precise treatment planning, and ultimately prevent vision loss for a broader range of patients. This approach reduces dependency on extensive manual annotation, making advanced diagnostic tools more accessible and cost-effective in real-world clinical practice.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.</p>
