                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper proposes a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework for accurate retinal disease diagnosis, specifically tackling the challenges of data scarcity and class imbalance in medical datasets. By integrating balanced sampling, targeted augmentation (including CLAHE), and an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 encoder, the method significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces bias toward majority classes, notably improving the detection of underrepresented retinal diseases.</p>

                    <p>The study proposes a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework applied to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD), focusing on its ten most represented but still significantly imbalanced classes.

(ii) **Targeted Augmentation** specifically for minority classes, incorporating Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) along with standard color and geometry transformations to improve data diversity. (iii) A **ResNet-50 encoder**, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used for robust feature extraction of fine-grained retinal details. Classification is performed by computing prototypes in the embedding space and using cosine similarity for stability. The framework was trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.</p>
