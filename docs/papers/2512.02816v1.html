                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology involved the creation of TCM-BEST4SDT, a clinical case-based benchmark dataset, under the guidance of TCM experts and employing a rigorous data annotation pipeline. A specialized reward model was developed to quantify the congruence between proposed prescriptions and differentiated syndromes. The evaluation framework for LLMs integrates three distinct mechanisms: selected-response evaluation (likely for knowledge-based tasks), judge model evaluation (for more open-ended assessments), and the prescription-syndrome congruence reward model evaluation (for treatment decision-making). The benchmark's efficacy was then validated through experiments conducted on 15 mainstream LLMs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.</p>
