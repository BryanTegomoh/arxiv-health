                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper surveys the application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for COVID-19 prevention and control, proposing a conceptual fog-cloud combined IoT platform. The platform is designed to systematically integrate five critical non-pharmaceutical interventions: symptom diagnosis, quarantine monitoring, contact tracing & social distancing, outbreak forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 mutation tracking, leveraging state-of-the-art literature.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to public health and clinical medicine by offering a systematic, technology-driven approach to non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are crucial when pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines are unavailable or insufficient during pandemics, thereby minimizing disease spread and impact on healthcare systems.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The paper proposes an 'intelligent' IoT platform for COVID-19 prevention and control. Specifically, 'COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting' is a direct application of AI (e.g., machine learning, predictive analytics) to health data for public health planning and intervention. AI could also be involved in 'COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis' through pattern recognition, and 'SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking' through genomic analysis.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations of the survey itself. However, as a conceptual proposal based on a literature review, an implicit limitation is that the proposed fog-cloud IoT platform is not yet implemented or empirically validated in a real-world scenario. The abstract also notes the current unavailability of pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines as the motivating context for the proposed non-pharmaceutical approach.</p>

                <p>The paper implies a clear future direction: the desirable implementation and deployment of a long-term, systematic IoT platform for non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat current and future infectious disease epidemics. This would involve the actual design, development, testing, and scaling of such a fog-cloud combined IoT system in practical settings.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics.</p>
