                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">CP-Env is a novel, controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) across complex, end-to-end clinical pathways, moving beyond static or isolated benchmarks. The evaluation reveals that most LLMs struggle significantly with pathway complexity, often exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details, with interesting insights into reasoning steps and tool dependency in top models. This benchmark aims to advance the development of robust medical AI agents for real-world healthcare applications.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.</p>
