                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The researchers developed a deep learning-based tumor segmentation method for DCE-MRI. They incorporated image acquisition time into the model by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, which dynamically adjust model features based on the specific acquisition sequence. This technique is designed to be lightweight and accommodate the variable number of images acquired in DCE-MRI studies. Models were trained and evaluated, comparing baseline architectures with various time-modulated configurations, on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset, with additional generalization testing on an independent out-of-domain dataset.</p>

Crucially, this time-informed approach also led to superior model generalization, yielding better results on both the images from the training domain and an external, out-of-domain dataset.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.</p>
