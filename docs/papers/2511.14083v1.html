                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a multi-stage deep learning pipeline. Stage 1 utilized a U-Net convolutional neural network to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus from 3D CT images. Stage 2 involved a second neural network designed to detect specific anatomical glenoid rim points. In Stage 3, geometric fitting techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), projection onto an en-face view, and best-circle fitting, were applied to these detected points to precisely compute the percentage of glenoid bone loss. The pipeline was trained and validated using 91 retrospectively collected patient CT scans, accompanied by expert manual labels for segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The automated bone loss measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and significantly surpassed surgeon-to-surgeon consistency, with an ICC of 0.84 compared to 0.78 for human readers. This superior consistency was particularly evident in both low-bone-loss (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63) and high-bone-loss (ICC 0.83 vs 0.21) subgroups (P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low severity and 0.857 for high severity, crucially without any cases being misclassified between the low and high severity groups.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This automated deep learning pipeline offers a significant clinical advancement by providing a time-efficient and highly reliable method for measuring glenoid bone loss. It can standardize pre-operative planning for shoulder instability, reduce inter-reader variability among orthopedic surgeons and radiologists, and facilitate more accurate and consistent surgical decision-making. The ability to precisely classify bone loss severity can improve patient screening, identify candidates for specific surgical techniques (e.g., bone transfer procedures), and ultimately lead to better surgical outcomes and reduced recurrence rates in shoulder instability patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.
