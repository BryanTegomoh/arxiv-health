                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employs a computational linguistics approach by investigating state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of Dutch metaphor extraction from cancer patient interviews and online forum data. It systematically explores various prompting strategies for LLMs, such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting, to optimize extraction. A critical human-in-the-loop verification process is integrated to ensure the accuracy and quality of the extracted metaphors, which are then compiled into the HealthQuote.NL corpus.</p>

                    <p>The primary outcome is the successful extraction of Dutch metaphors from cancer patient communication data, rigorously verified by human experts. This process culminates in the creation of the HealthQuote.NL corpus, a valuable resource for further research and clinical application. The research also provides insights into the effectiveness of different LLM prompting strategies for nuanced linguistic tasks in a specialized medical context.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Metaphors and metaphorical language (MLs) play an important role in
healthcare communication between clinicians, patients, and patients' family
members. In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We
extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient
storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients'
posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring
different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot
learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the
extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL.
We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example
shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians,
and enhanced patient health literacy. They can also inform the design of
personalized care pathways. We share prompts and related resources at
