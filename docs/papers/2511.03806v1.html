                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">FusionDP addresses the critical challenge of preserving patient privacy while maintaining model utility when only a subset of features is sensitive. This two-step framework leverages large foundation models to impute sensitive features, then employs a modified differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm to train models on both original and imputed features, rigorously protecting the privacy of the original sensitive features. Evaluated on medical tasks like sepsis prediction and clinical note classification, FusionDP significantly enhances model performance compared to privacy-preserving baselines while maintaining strong feature-level privacy guarantees.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>FusionDP employs a two-step process: 1) High-quality imputation of sensitive features is performed by leveraging pre-trained large foundation models, using only non-sensitive features as input. These imputed features act as external priors. 2) A custom-designed differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm trains the machine learning model. This modified algorithm processes both the original non-sensitive features and the foundation model-imputed sensitive features, while rigorously enforcing differential privacy specifically on the true sensitive features, not the imputed ones.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.</p>
