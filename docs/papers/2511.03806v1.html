                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>FusionDP utilizes a two-step process: (1) **Foundation Model-Assisted Imputation**: Large pre-trained foundation models are employed to generate estimates of sensitive features, using only the non-sensitive features as input. These imputed values act as high-quality, privacy-preserving proxies for the true sensitive data. (2) **Modified Differentially Private SGD Training**: A specifically adapted differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm is then used to train the main machine learning model. This algorithm integrates both the original non-sensitive features and the imputed sensitive features, ensuring formal differential privacy guarantees specifically for the original sensitive features during the training process.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.</p>
