                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper analyzes 5,126 Reddit posts detailing users' experiences with AI for emotional support and mental health, revealing that engagement is primarily driven by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, not solely emotional bonds. It found positive sentiment correlates with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use often leads to misaligned alliances and risks like dependence and symptom escalation.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>User engagement with AI for mental health is predominantly driven by narrated positive outcomes, user trust in the AI, and the quality of its responses, rather than the formation of an emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is strongly linked to task and goal alignment. Conversely, AI use aimed at companionship frequently results in misaligned therapeutic alliances and is associated with reported risks including user dependence and the escalation of mental health symptoms.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>This research provides critical insights for clinicians and AI developers in mental health. It suggests that AI tools should prioritize functional utility and accurate task/goal alignment over simulated emotional connection to maximize positive outcomes and minimize risks. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for dependence and symptom escalation in patients using AI for companionship and consider these factors when advising on or integrating digital mental health tools. It underscores the need for clear guidelines and careful monitoring of AI use in sensitive mental health contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for emotional support and mental health-related interactions outside clinical settings, yet little is known about how people evaluate and relate to these systems in everyday use. We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.</p>
