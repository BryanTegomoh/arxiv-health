                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a novel evaluation suite and benchmark dataset for systematically measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in complex, end-to-end bioinformatics tasks. It evaluates both closed-source and open-weight models, revealing that while agents can construct high-level pipelines, they often fail under controlled perturbations, underscoring critical weaknesses in step-level reasoning. The research also highlights the crucial trade-off between model performance and data privacy, advocating for open-weight models in sensitive clinical contexts despite lower completion rates.</p>

                    <p>The methodology involved developing BioAgent Bench, a dataset of curated end-to-end bioinformatics tasks requiring concrete output artifacts. Various frontier closed-source and open-weight AI models were evaluated across different agent harnesses. An LLM-based grader was employed to automatically score pipeline progress and the validity of generated outcomes. Stress testing was conducted by introducing controlled perturbations such as corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat to assess model robustness.</p>

                    <p>AI agents are capable of constructing and completing high-level bioinformatics pipelines and producing desired final artifacts without extensive custom scaffolding. However, these agents exhibit significant failure modes and a lack of reliable step-level reasoning when subjected to controlled perturbations like corrupted inputs or prompt bloat. Furthermore, the evaluation underscored that while closed-source models might offer higher completion rates, their use is problematic in scenarios involving sensitive patient data, making open-weight models a necessary, albeit less efficient, alternative under strict privacy constraints.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.</p>
