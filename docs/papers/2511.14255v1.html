                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The authors developed AfriSpeech-MultiBench, a benchmark suite for over 100 African English accents from 10+ countries, incorporating seven application-specific domains. They evaluated a diverse set of open and closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversations collected from various open African accented English speech datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Empirical analysis revealed that open-source ASR models perform well in spontaneous speech but degrade significantly with noisy, non-native dialogue. Multimodal LLMs demonstrated greater accent robustness but struggled specifically with domain-specific named entities. Proprietary models achieved high accuracy on clean speech, but their performance varied considerably across countries and domains. Models fine-tuned on African English data achieved competitive accuracy with the added benefit of lower latency, yet hallucinations remained a pervasive problem for most state-of-the-art models.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.</p>
