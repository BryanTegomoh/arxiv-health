                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study investigates how state-of-the-art deterministic AI-based weather models can be extended towards probabilistic forecasting of extreme events through initial-condition perturbations. By generating 50-member ensembles for major 2022 events (Pakistan floods, China heatwave), the research demonstrates that flow-dependent perturbations significantly enhance ensemble spread realism and probabilistic skill, narrowing but not fully closing the performance gap with traditional numerical weather prediction ensembles.</p>

                    <p>The study utilized state-of-the-art deterministic AI weather models (FuXi, GraphCast, SFNO). To assess uncertainty, 50-member ensembles were generated for each model using three distinct initial-condition perturbation strategies: Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors (HCBV), and Huge Ensembles. These ensembles were applied to forecast the Pakistan floods and China heatwave in August 2022. Performance was evaluated against ERA5 reanalysis and benchmarked against the ECMWF's IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using a combination of deterministic and probabilistic metrics.</p>

                    <p>The most significant finding is that flow-dependent perturbation strategies substantially improve the realism of ensemble spread and the probabilistic forecast skill of AI-based weather models for extreme events. AI models showed greater efficacy in capturing temperature extremes than precipitation extremes. Despite these improvements, the AI ensembles did not fully close the performance gap with established numerical weather prediction ensembles.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Enhanced predictive skill for extreme weather events directly supports the development of more reliable and timely early warning systems crucial for healthcare planning and disaster response. This can lead to more effective allocation of medical resources (e.g., emergency personnel, cooling centers, medical supplies for trauma or infectious diseases), targeted public health advisories for vulnerable populations, and ultimately, a reduction in weather-related morbidity and mortality during crises like heatwaves, floods, and storms.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate prediction of extreme weather events remains a major challenge for artificial intelligence based weather prediction systems. While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.</p>
