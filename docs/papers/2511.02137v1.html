                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DoFlow introduces a flow-based generative model that integrates causal reasoning into time-series forecasting, enabling accurate observational predictions, interventional forecasting, and counterfactual analysis by leveraging continuous normalizing flows over a causal DAG. Beyond prediction, it provides explicit trajectory likelihoods for principled anomaly detection, demonstrating robust performance on synthetic, hydropower, and real-world cancer treatment time series data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research is highly relevant to medicine by enabling a deeper understanding of dynamic physiological processes and treatment effects, moving beyond mere correlation to causal inference. It allows for predicting patient outcomes under specific interventions (e.g., drug dosages) and exploring 'what-if' counterfactual scenarios (e.g., alternative treatments), crucial for personalized medicine and optimal clinical decision-making.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>DoFlow can be applied in health to forecast disease progression, predict patient responses to different treatment interventions ('what if we change the dosage?'), analyze counterfactual scenarios ('what would have happened if the patient received a different treatment?'), and detect anomalies in patient health time-series data (e.g., early signs of relapse, adverse drug reactions, or sudden changes in physiological parameters like vital signs in an ICU setting). Specifically for cancer treatment, it could model the causal effects of various therapies on tumor markers or patient outcomes over time.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DoFlow employs a flow-based generative model defined on a causal DAG, where latent variables evolve according to a learned dynamics. It leverages Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to transform simple base distributions into complex data distributions, facilitating the natural encoding and decoding of time-series data. This allows for the generation of observational predictions, as well as predictions under specific interventions (do-operators) and counterfactual queries by manipulating the latent space and flow structure.</p>

Critically, it successfully enables causal forecasting for interventional and counterfactual queries, providing reliable predictions for scenarios where specific variables are manipulated or alternative histories are considered. Furthermore, its ability to compute explicit likelihoods of future trajectories translates into effective anomaly detection.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Clinically, DoFlow could empower physicians with advanced tools for personalized medicine. It could predict individual patient responses to different treatment regimens (interventions), optimize treatment protocols by simulating various options, and help understand why a patient's outcome differed from an expected path (counterfactuals). This capability is vital for proactive management of diseases, minimizing adverse effects, and improving patient care by providing causal insights into complex biological systems.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract notes that the supporting counterfactual recovery result is achieved 'under certain assumptions.' This implies that the robustness and validity of DoFlow's counterfactual predictions are conditional on these underlying assumptions holding true, which might be a limiting factor in highly complex or poorly characterized real-world clinical environments where all causal relationships and exogenous confounders are not perfectly known or modeled.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Time-series forecasting increasingly demands not only accurate observational
predictions but also causal forecasting under interventional and counterfactual
queries in multivariate systems. We present DoFlow, a flow based generative
model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and
interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural
encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also
provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions.
Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future
trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic
datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment
time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational
forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual
queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the
broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex
dynamical systems.</p>
