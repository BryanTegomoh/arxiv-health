                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>DNA-Prior employs an unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations. Its core methodology relies on a mathematically principled hybrid prior, which is a combination of two components: (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through the parameterization of a deep network, and (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior. The explicit prior consists of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation results in a well-structured optimization problem designed to jointly preserve global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure.</p>

                <p>DNA-Prior has the potential to significantly enhance medical imaging pipelines by providing a robust and adaptable denoising solution. It can stabilize critical downstream tasks like segmentation and reconstruction, leading to more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.</p>
