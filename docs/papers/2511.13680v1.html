                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces a multi-task cross-learning framework designed to overcome the challenges of data scarcity by jointly estimating deterministic parameters across multiple, related tasks. It formulates this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where constraints dictate the similarity between model parameters, enabling knowledge transfer from data-rich tasks to data-scarce ones. This approach leads to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, particularly critical in scenarios with limited available data.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This framework is highly relevant to medicine and health research, as it provides a robust solution for developing accurate models in critical scenarios where patient data is inherently scarce, sensitive, or difficult to collect in large volumes, such as rare diseases, specific patient cohorts, or emerging outbreaks.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI method (multi-task cross-learning from scarce data) can be applied to model the propagation of infectious diseases. This allows for more accurate and reliable parameter estimation of disease models even when initial data is limited, which is critical for predicting outbreaks, informing public health interventions, and understanding pathogen spread, especially for novel or rapidly evolving threats where data is initially scarce.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.</p>
