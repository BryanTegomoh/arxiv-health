                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Particle therapy relies on up-to-date knowledge of the stopping power of the
patient tissues to deliver the prescribed dose distribution. The stopping power
describes the average particle motion, which is encoded in the distribution of
prompt-gamma photon emissions in time and space. We reconstruct the
spatiotemporal emission distribution from multi-detector Prompt Gamma Timing
(PGT) data. Solving this inverse problem relies on an accurate model of the
prompt-gamma transport and detection including explicitly the dependencies on
the time of emission and detection. Our previous work relied on Monte-Carlo
(MC) based system models. The tradeoff between computational resources and
statistical noise in the system model prohibits studies of new detector
arrangements and beam scanning scenarios. Therefore, we propose here an
analytical system model to speed up recalculations for new beam positions and
to avoid statistical noise in the model. We evaluated the model for the MERLINO
multi-detector-PGT prototype. Comparisons between the analytical model and a
MC-based reference showed excellent agreement for single-detector setups. When
several detectors were placed close together and partially obstructed each
other, intercrystal scatter led to differences of up to 10 % between the
analytical and MC-based model. Nevertheless, when evaluating the performance in
reconstructing the spatiotemporal distribution and estimating the stopping
power, no significant difference between the models was observed. Hence, the
procedure proved robust against the small inaccuracies of the model for the
tested scenarios. The model calculation time was reduced by 1500 times, now
enabling many new studies for PGT-based systems.</p>
