                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed an AI-enabled natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze radiology reports for incidental thyroid findings (ITFs). It found ITFs in 7.8% of over 115,000 patients, showing these findings often trigger a cascade of investigations leading to the diagnosis of small, low-risk thyroid cancers, contributing significantly to overdiagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This research leverages AI to quantify the significant prevalence and clinical cascade associated with incidental thyroid findings, highlighting a major pathway to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. Understanding these patterns is crucial for refining clinical guidelines, reducing unnecessary procedures, and improving patient outcomes in thyroid disease management.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline. Its purpose is to automatically identify Incidental Thyroid Findings (ITFs) and extract nodule characteristics from unstructured text in radiology reports. This AI system enables large-scale epidemiological analysis of clinical data, which would be impractical manually, providing insights into disease prevalence, patient outcomes, and potential healthcare challenges like overdiagnosis.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 115,683 adult patients without prior thyroid disease at Mayo Clinic from July 2017 to September 2023. A transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline was developed, validated, and deployed to identify incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) and extract specific nodule characteristics from radiology reports across multiple modalities and body regions. Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic and imaging-related factors associated with ITFs and to assess their association with downstream clinical outcomes.</p>

                <section class="paper-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>7.8% of the cohort (9,077 patients) had an ITF, with 92.9% being thyroid nodules. ITFs were more prevalent in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Detection rates were higher for neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans compared to chest CT. Documentation of nodule characteristics was severely lacking (e.g., size in 44%, other features <15%). Patients with ITFs had significantly increased odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers detected were papillary and larger when found after ITFs, reinforcing their contribution to overdiagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The study demonstrates that incidental thyroid findings commonly trigger a cascade of investigations and interventions, leading to the diagnosis of many small, low-risk thyroid cancers, which is a major driver of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. This necessitates a shift towards standardized reporting of ITFs in radiology to ensure complete and consistent information, and the development of more selective, risk-stratified follow-up guidelines to reduce unnecessary biopsies, surgeries, and associated patient anxiety and healthcare costs.</p>
            </section>

            
            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The primary limitation identified is the poor documentation of nodule characteristics within the radiology reports themselves (e.g., size reported in only 44% of cases, other features in fewer than 15%), which constrains the ability to comprehensively risk stratify ITFs based on documented imaging features. Being a single-center retrospective study may also affect generalizability.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The authors explicitly call for the development and implementation of standardized reporting protocols for incidental thyroid findings in radiology. Furthermore, they advocate for the creation of more selective, evidence-based follow-up guidelines to optimize the management of ITFs and mitigate the problem of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.</p>
