                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This study developed and deployed a transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze radiology reports for Incidental Thyroid Findings (ITFs). It found that ITFs are common (7.8% of patients) and significantly associated with a cascade of downstream procedures and the diagnosis of mostly small, low-risk papillary thyroid cancers, highlighting a substantial role in overdiagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This study quantifies the prevalence and clinical impact of incidental thyroid findings, demonstrating how they trigger diagnostic cascades that often lead to the detection of low-risk cancers, directly informing debates on overdiagnosis and the urgent need for refined clinical guidelines for patient follow-up and management.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to automatically identify incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) and extract detailed nodule characteristics from unstructured text within radiology reports. This AI system facilitates large-scale analysis of medical records to understand the prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes of ITFs, contributing to insights on thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and informing better clinical follow-up strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The study identified ITFs in 7.8% (9,077 of 115,683) of patients, predominantly as nodules (92.9%). ITFs were more prevalent in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine, with neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans more likely to detect them than chest CT. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in only 44% and other features in less than 15%. Patients with ITFs had significantly higher odds of subsequent thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers found were papillary and larger when detected after an ITF compared to those found without an ITF history.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The high prevalence of ITFs and their strong association with diagnostic cascades leading to small, low-risk thyroid cancers significantly contributes to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. This research emphasizes the critical need for standardized reporting guidelines for thyroid nodules within radiology reports and the development of more selective, risk-stratified follow-up protocols for ITFs to mitigate unnecessary procedures, patient anxiety, and healthcare resource expenditure.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.</p>
