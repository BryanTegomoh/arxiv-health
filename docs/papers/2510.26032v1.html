                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This research developed an AI-enabled Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze radiology reports for incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) in a large patient cohort. It revealed ITFs are common (7.8%) and significantly trigger diagnostic cascades (ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy), often leading to the detection of small, low-risk papillary thyroid cancers, underscoring their role in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>This study is highly relevant as it quantifies the prevalence and diagnostic implications of incidental thyroid findings, a growing clinical concern. It directly addresses the issue of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, providing data to inform more judicious management of ITFs and potentially reduce unnecessary patient interventions and healthcare burdens.</p>

                <p>Development, validation, and deployment of a transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to automatically identify incidental thyroid findings and extract nodule characteristics from unstructured radiology reports. This AI application enables large-scale epidemiological analysis of medical findings and their clinical consequences, informing diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies.</p>

                    <li>A transformer-based NLP pipeline was developed and deployed to identify incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) and extract nodule characteristics from diverse radiology reports.</li>
                    
                    <li>In a retrospective cohort of 115,683 adults without prior thyroid disease, ITFs were present in 7.8% of patients, with 92.9% being thyroid nodules.</li>
                    
                    <li>ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine, as well as via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans compared to chest CT.</li>
                    
                    <li>Documentation of nodule characteristics in reports was poor; size was reported in only 44% of cases, and other features (e.g., calcifications) in less than 15%.</li>
                    
                    <li>Patients with ITFs had significantly higher odds of downstream thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis.</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The study employed a retrospective cohort design, analyzing data from 115,683 adults without pre-existing thyroid disease who underwent thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from July 2017 to September 2023.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>7.8% (9,077) of patients had an ITF, predominantly nodules (92.9%). ITFs were more prevalent in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine, or performed via neck CT, PET, or nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented (size in 44%, other features <15%). ITFs were strongly associated with significantly increased odds of downstream thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. The majority of cancers detected were papillary and larger post-ITF detection, suggesting a link to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The findings underscore the necessity for standardized reporting of incidental thyroid nodule characteristics in radiology to enable better risk stratification. Clinically, this research advocates for the development and implementation of more selective and evidence-based follow-up protocols for ITFs, aiming to reduce the diagnostic cascade that leads to overdiagnosis and potential overtreatment of indolent thyroid cancers, thereby minimizing patient anxiety, morbidity from unnecessary procedures, and healthcare costs.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract implicitly suggests limitations, such as the current lack of standardized reporting for nodule characteristics, which impacts data consistency. As a single-institution, retrospective study at Mayo Clinic, generalizability to other populations or healthcare systems might be limited. The abstract does not detail the specific validation metrics for the NLP pipeline.</p>

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The paper explicitly calls for the need for standardized reporting of incidental thyroid findings in radiology reports. It also implicitly suggests the development and implementation of more selective, risk-stratified follow-up guidelines for ITFs to reduce overdiagnosis. Further research could focus on validating these guidelines in prospective studies and refining AI tools for more comprehensive nodule characterization.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.</p>
