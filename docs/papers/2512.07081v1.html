                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>ClinNoteAgents is an LLM-based multi-agent system designed to process free-text clinical notes. It employs two primary mechanisms: 1) converting free-text into structured representations of clinical and social risk factors suitable for association analysis, and 2) generating clinician-style abstractions from the notes to directly predict 30-day heart failure readmission. This framework aims to overcome the challenges of jargon, abbreviations, and misspellings in clinical text without relying on traditional expert-crafted rules or extensive ontologies.</p>

                <p>This system offers a scalable and interpretable solution for HF readmission risk modeling, particularly valuable for healthcare systems with limited structured data. By efficiently converting complex clinical narratives into actionable insights, it can facilitate proactive identification of high-risk patients, guide targeted interventions, and potentially reduce rehospitalization rates, while simultaneously reducing the burden of manual data annotation and model development.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems.</p>
