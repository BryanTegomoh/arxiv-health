                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper validates a fully-automated deep learning (DL)-based method for segmenting fibroglandular tissue (FGT) in breast MRI to quantify background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), a potential breast cancer risk marker. The DL method outperformed a semi-automated fuzzy c-means approach by yielding higher quality segmentations and stronger correlations with qualitative BPE assessments, promising more efficient and standardized breast cancer risk evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) shows potential as a breast cancer risk
marker. Clinically, BPE is qualitatively assessed by radiologists, but
quantitative BPE measures offer potential for more precise risk evaluation.
This study evaluated an existing open-source, fully-automated deep
learning-based (DL-based) method for segmenting fibroglandular tissue (FGT) to
quantify BPE and compared it to a semi-automated fuzzy c-means method. Using
breast MRI examinations from 100 women, we evaluated segmentation agreement,
concordance across quantitative BPE metrics, and associations with qualitative
BPE. The quality of FGT segmentations from both methods was scored by a
radiologist. While the DL-based and semi-automated methods showed good
agreement for quantitative BPE measurements, DL-based measures more strongly
correlated with qualitative BPE assessments and DL-based segmentations were
scored as higher quality by the radiologist. Our findings suggest that DL-based
FGT segmentation enhances efficiency for objective BPE quantification and may
improve standardized breast cancer risk assessment.</p>
