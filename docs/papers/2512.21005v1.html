                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP) as a novel computational framework to accurately predict infectious disease outbreaks, particularly in geographic regions characterized by sparse or zero historical case data. By utilizing the concept of absolute abundance and borrowing statistical strength from related areas, PHIBP successfully generates robust predictive distributions and meaningful epidemiological insights, overcoming the inherent challenges of sparse count data that hinder traditional relative-rate methods.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The core methodology centers on the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP). This statistical framework utilizes a hierarchical Bayesian structure that models sparse count data by 'borrowing statistical strength' across related entities (e.g., geographic regions). It operates on the concept of absolute abundance, rendering it robust to zero counts, unlike conventional relative-rate methods. The approach's efficacy was demonstrated through a series of computational experiments on infectious disease data.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The PHIBP framework provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions for infectious diseases. It enables the effective utilization of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity in epidemiological analysis. Critically, the approach consistently delivers accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights, specifically in data-sparse environments.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability to accurately predict infectious disease outbreaks in regions with limited data can dramatically enhance public health preparedness and response. This translates to earlier deployment of resources, targeted vaccine distribution, and timely implementation of interventions, leading to more effective disease control, reduced morbidity and mortality, and better-informed decision-making for healthcare systems, especially in resource-constrained or under-reported areas.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.</p>
