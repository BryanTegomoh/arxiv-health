                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces 'Peakspan,' a novel metric defining the age interval during which an individual maintains at least 90% of their peak functional performance in specific physiological or cognitive domains. It highlights that traditional health metrics, like Healthspan, overlook a critical functional decline, revealing that most biological systems peak early, resulting in a remarkably short Peakspan and a significant portion of adult life spent in a 'healthy but declined' state.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Peakspan provides a more granular and functional metric than Healthspan for assessing the quality of aging, identifying a critical period of functional decline that current medical interventions often overlook. It redefines the goals of rejuvenative medicine towards maintaining and restoring peak physiological and cognitive capacities, rather than solely focusing on disease prevention.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence and foundational models of biological aging are proposed as crucial tools for recognizing and tracking Peakspan, which will aid in developing strategies to compress functional morbidity and maximize human potential across the life course. This implies AI will be used for monitoring, data analysis, and potentially predicting functional decline and guiding interventions related to aging and health.</p>

                    <p>The paper presents a conceptual framework for defining and quantifying Peakspan, based on insights from an unspecified 'multi-system analysis' indicating early adult peak capacities.

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The primary finding is that the Peakspan – the period of maintaining at least 90% peak functional performance – is remarkably short relative to the total human lifespan across most biological and cognitive domains. This results in the majority of adult life being spent in a 'healthy but declined' state with a significant functional gap, even in the absence of diagnosed diseases.</p>

            <section class="paper-section">
                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>Clinically, Peakspan could enable earlier identification of individuals experiencing significant functional decline well before overt disease onset, prompting targeted preventative or rejuvenative interventions. It could serve as a quantifiable biomarker for assessing the efficacy of anti-aging therapies, precision medicine approaches aimed at preserving or restoring peak function, and for guiding personalized healthcare plans to maximize functional independence and quality of life in later years.</p>

                <p>The abstract implicitly highlights limitations of traditional health metrics (e.g., Healthspan) which fail to capture the gradual erosion of physiological capacity and functional decline. While introducing a novel conceptual framework, the abstract does not detail specific empirical study limitations of *this paper's own methodology*, beyond proposing a conceptual basis and future mechanisms for tracking Peakspan.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">The unprecedented extension of the human lifespan necessitates a parallel evolution in how we quantify the quality of aging and its socioeconomic impact. Traditional metrics focusing on Healthspan (years free of disease) overlook the gradual erosion of physiological capacity that occurs even in the absence of illness, leading to declines in productivity and eventual lack of capacity to work. To address this critical gap, we introduce Peakspan: the age interval during which an individual maintains at least 90% of their peak functional performance in a specific physiological or cognitive domain. Our multi-system analysis reveals a profound misalignment: most biological systems reach maximal capacity in early adulthood, resulting in a Peakspan that is remarkably short relative to the total lifespan. This dissociation means humans now spend the majority of their adult lives in a "healthy but declined" state, characterized by a significant functional gap. We argue that extending Peakspan and developing strategies to restore function in post-peak individuals is the functional manifestation of rejuvenative biomedical progress and is essential for sustained economic growth in aging societies. Recognizing and tracking Peakspan, increasingly facilitated by artificial intelligence and foundational models of biological aging, is crucial for developing strategies to compress functional morbidity and maximize human potential across the life course.</p>
