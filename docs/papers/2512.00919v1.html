                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces Augmented Spectral Feature Learning (ASFL), a novel framework for nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression that addresses causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders. ASFL makes the feature learning process outcome-aware by minimizing a contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator incorporating outcome information, thereby remaining effective even when standard spectral features fail due to spectral misalignment. This approach provides robust causal inference by learning task-specific features that accurately represent the true causal function.</p>

                <h2>Medical Relevance</h2>
                <p>Accurate causal effect estimation is paramount in medicine for understanding treatment efficacy, disease etiology, and the impact of health interventions, especially when unmeasured factors (hidden confounders) are present. This method offers a more robust and reliable tool for deriving causal insights from observational health data, crucial for evidence-based medicine and policy-making.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>This research provides a novel and more robust machine learning method for causal inference from complex datasets. It can be applied within medical AI systems designed to analyze observational health data (e.g., Electronic Health Records, claims data, public health registries). Specifically, it could power AI applications that aim to: 1) Estimate the true causal effect of drugs or medical interventions on patient outcomes, controlling for unobserved factors; 2) Develop more reliable predictive models for treatment response or disease progression by accounting for causality; 3) Inform clinical decision support systems with more robust evidence; 4) Evaluate public health interventions and policies accurately. By making feature learning 'outcome-aware,' it enhances the ability of AI models to pinpoint causally relevant features for health outcomes.</p>

                    <p>The proposed Augmented Spectral Feature Learning (ASFL) method operates within the framework of nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. It learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss function. This loss is derived from an "augmented operator" which is specifically designed to incorporate information from the outcome variable, thus making the feature learning process "outcome-aware." This enables the identification of task-specific features that better represent the true causal function, particularly under conditions of spectral misalignment. The approach includes theoretical analysis of its framework and empirical validation on challenging benchmark datasets.</p>

                    <p>The paper demonstrates that the proposed Augmented Spectral Feature Learning (ASFL) framework effectively learns outcome-aware features, successfully overcoming the limitations of traditional outcome-agnostic spectral features in nonparametric IV regression. It shows that ASFL remains effective even under conditions of spectral misalignment, where the true causal function is poorly represented by dominant singular functions, a scenario where prior methods would fail.

                <p>This research has the potential to significantly enhance the reliability of causal inference in medical research, particularly in observational studies where ethical or practical constraints preclude randomized controlled trials. It could lead to more accurate assessments of drug efficacy, surgical outcomes, and the impact of lifestyle or environmental factors on health, even when unmeasured confounding variables are present. This increased accuracy would inform evidence-based clinical guidelines, improve patient care, and support the development of more effective public health strategies and precision medicine approaches.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. An established approach is to use estimators based on learned spectral features, that is, features spanning the top singular subspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. While powerful, such features are agnostic to the outcome variable. Consequently, the method can fail when the true causal function is poorly represented by these dominant singular functions. To mitigate, we introduce Augmented Spectral Feature Learning, a framework that makes the feature learning process outcome-aware. Our method learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator that incorporates information from the outcome. By learning these task-specific features, our approach remains effective even under spectral misalignment. We provide a theoretical analysis of this framework and validate our approach on challenging benchmarks.</p>
