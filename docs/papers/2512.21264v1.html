                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces AnyAD, a unified framework for robust anomaly detection and localization in brain MRI, specifically addressing the challenge of missing imaging modalities and scarce abnormal data in clinical workflows. By integrating a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with feature alignment and a novel INP-guided decoder, AnyAD effectively adapts to arbitrary modality availability without re-training. The model demonstrates superior generalization and performance over state-of-the-art baselines across various modality combinations and datasets.</p>

                <h2>AI Health Application</h2>
                <p>The AI application is a robust, 'any-modality' anomaly detection and localization system for brain MRI. It aims to assist radiologists in identifying abnormal patterns (e.g., tumors, lesions, or other pathologies) in brain scans, even when certain MRI sequences are missing or incomplete. This can lead to more accurate and efficient diagnosis, reducing the need for repetitive training or re-scans in clinical settings, and ultimately improving patient care by enhancing the detection of critical neurological conditions.</p>

                    <p>The AnyAD framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder for feature extraction. A key component is the feature distribution alignment mechanism, which statistically normalizes features from incomplete modality sets to match full-modality representations.

Training involves randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion to teach the model adaptability to all modality configurations without requiring re-training.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.</p>
