                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper introduces BronchOpt, a vision-based pose optimization framework designed for accurate intra-operative bronchoscope tip localization, addressing challenges like respiratory motion and anatomical variability. It employs a fine-tuned, domain-invariant encoder and differentiable rendering for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between real endoscopic views and pre-operative CT scans. The framework, trained on a novel synthetic benchmark dataset, achieves precise localization (2.65 mm, 0.19 rad error on synthetic data) and demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization to real patient data.</p>

                    <p>The BronchOpt framework employs a vision-based pose optimization approach for 2D-3D registration. It leverages a fine-tuned deep learning encoder, specifically designed to be modality- and domain-invariant, to compute similarity metrics between real endoscopic RGB frames and synthetic depth maps rendered from pre-operative CT scans. A differentiable rendering module then iteratively refines the bronchoscope's camera pose by minimizing depth inconsistencies. The entire system is trained exclusively on a novel, publicly available synthetic benchmark dataset, which provides paired CT-endoscopy data for supervised learning.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.</p>
