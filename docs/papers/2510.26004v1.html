                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DARTS is a novel drone-based, AI-powered system for real-time traffic incident detection, addressing the limitations of conventional methods like slow response times and infrastructure dependency. It integrates drone mobility, thermal imaging, and a lightweight deep learning framework to achieve high detection accuracy and provide rapid incident verification, severity assessment, and congestion monitoring. A field test demonstrated DARTS detected a collision 12 minutes earlier than existing systems, offering significant potential for faster emergency response and reducing crash-related injuries and fatalities.</p>

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The primary clinical impact is the potential for drastically reducing prehospital times for trauma patients involved in traffic incidents. By providing incident detection up to 12 minutes faster, DARTS can enable earlier dispatch of emergency medical services (EMS), leading to quicker arrival at the scene, faster patient stabilization, and more rapid transport to definitive care. This accelerated response time is crucial for patients with life-threatening injuries, potentially improving survival rates and reducing long-term disability, while also mitigating the risk of secondary crashes and subsequent additional injuries.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.</p>
