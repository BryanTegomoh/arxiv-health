                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">DARTS is a novel drone-based, AI-powered system designed for real-time traffic incident detection, addressing limitations of conventional methods such as slow response and infrastructure dependence. By integrating adaptive drone surveillance, thermal imaging, and a lightweight deep learning framework, DARTS achieved 99% detection accuracy and demonstrated a 12-minute earlier incident verification in a field test compared to traditional systems. This facilitates significantly faster emergency response, proactive traffic control, and improved management of incident-induced congestion.</p>

                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>DARTS achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset.

                <h2>Clinical Impact</h2>
                <p>The ability of DARTS to provide significantly earlier and verified incident detection has a profound clinical impact by drastically cutting down Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response times to traffic accidents. This allows for the expedited delivery of life-saving medical interventions, optimization of pre-hospital care, and more rapid transportation of critically injured patients to appropriate trauma facilities, thereby enhancing patient survival rates and mitigating the long-term impact of severe injuries. Furthermore, its capacity for proactive traffic control can help prevent secondary crashes, reducing the overall burden of trauma.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>The abstract does not explicitly state limitations. However, it implies that DARTS is currently a 'promising step' and focuses on its 'potential' for scalability and cost-effectiveness, suggesting that broad, widespread deployment and validation across diverse operational environments or large-scale urban/rural settings are yet to be fully achieved. The system's reliance on a 'self-collected dataset' may also suggest a need for further validation on more diverse and larger datasets to ensure generalizability.</p>

                <p>The study positions DARTS as a "promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system." Implicit future directions include expanding field testing to diverse geographical and environmental conditions, further refining the deep learning models for a wider array of incident types and complex scenarios, and exploring full integration with existing emergency response and transportation management infrastructures to ensure seamless operation and rapid data dissemination. Realizing the full potential for scalability and cost-effectiveness, especially in remote and resource-constrained settings, also represents a key future endeavor.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.</p>
