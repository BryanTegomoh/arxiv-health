                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerators (MRI-Linacs) are an emerging treatment technology that enable online soft-tissue visualisation and adaptive radiotherapy. The Australian 1.0 T MRI-Linac employs a fixed, inline beamline, with treatment angles achieved via patient couch rotation, and currently relies on a radiolucent whole-body radiofrequency (RF) coil. However, the large coil-patient separation limits signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and constrains the fast imaging required for real-time tumour tracking. Here, we show the design and validation of a dedicated, flexible 8-element receive-only RF torso array tailored to the geometry and beam access requirements of the Australian MRI-Linac. Electromagnetic simulations, bench measurements, and phantom imaging demonstrate approximately three-fold SNR improvement at the centre and eight-fold improvement at superficial regions compared with the whole-body coil. In vivo abdominal imaging confirms enhanced anatomical detail and sharper tissue boundaries, and the increased SNR enables parallel imaging with GRAPPA acceleration factors up to three without severe artefacts. Dosimetry measurements and dynamic beam-on noise analysis confirm that the coil array is effectively radiolucent, with dose differences below 1% and no measurable degradation in image noise. This work demonstrates a practical RF solution for accelerated, high-SNR imaging compatible with patient rotation and beam delivery on the Australian MRI-Linac.</p>
