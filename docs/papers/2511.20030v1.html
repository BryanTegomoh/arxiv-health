                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">This paper addresses the challenges of clustering Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs), where existing multi-view methods struggle with noisy and weakly correlated features from large pre-trained models. The authors propose Dual Graph Filtering (DGF), a novel scheme that incorporates feature-wise denoising and a tri-cross contrastive training strategy to learn robust and discriminative node representations. DGF consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark MMAG datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology introduces the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, inspired by graph signal processing. DGF addresses noise and low correlation in multimodal attributes by integrating a novel feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning. Complementing this, DGF employs a tri-cross contrastive training strategy. This strategy applies instance-level contrastive learning across three distinct contexts: different data modalities (e.g., text vs. image features), local node neighborhoods within the graph, and inferred community structures. This approach aims to learn highly robust and discriminative node representations for superior clustering performance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.
  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.</p>
