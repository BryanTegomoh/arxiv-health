                    <p>MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of LLM agents designed for multi-turn discussions. During inference, it dynamically retrieves and integrates structured textual experiences into the agents' deliberation. A core methodological aspect is the implementation of credit assignment to create and then reinject a turn-level experience pool into the dialogue. This process allows agents to refine their reasoning and reach consensus for final decision-making, adapting to new information or scenarios without requiring full model retraining.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.</p>
